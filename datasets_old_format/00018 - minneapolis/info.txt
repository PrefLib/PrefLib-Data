Description: <p>The 2009 Minneapolis Data contains the results from the election for the Parks and Rec Commissioner and Tax Assessor in Minneapolis, MN.

The <b>No Write In</b> files contain the same votes removing any write-ins and modifying the votes accordingly.</p> <p>Note that these elections were conducted under a ranked voting system which allowed blank entries.
