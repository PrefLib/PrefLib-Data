# PrefLib-Data

This repository contains the data that is available at 
[PrefLib.org](https://preflib.org/>), together with some scripts
we are using to maintain the data.

## Format specification

The format specification for the PrefLib ecosystem is described in
[FORMAT_SPECIFICATION.md](https://github.com/PrefLib/PrefLib-Data/blob/main/FORMAT_SPECIFICATION.md).

## How To

### Add/Modify a dataset

### Run the sanity checks

### Generate the metadata.csv files

### Update the zip archives

## Old file format

The format for the files changed in September 2022. Since this can cause problems for application
developed prior to that date, we still provide the old files in the folder `datasets_old_format`.
