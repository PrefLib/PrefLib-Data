Description: <p>This dataset contains an election generated from board game charts.</p> <p>The underlying board games data (<a href="https://kaggle.com/mseinstein/bgg_top2000">kaggle.com/mseinstein/bgg_top2000</a>) contains a weekly ranking of the 2000 most popular board games on boardgamegeek.com between October 2018 and December 2021. We created a single election where each game is a candidate and each vote corresponds to the ranking of the games in one week.</p> <p>The patch contains the raw election and a post-processed version where some candidates and voters are deleted to make the election complete.</p> <p>This dataset is part of a larger study by Boehmer and Schaar (see <a href="/BoSc22">this page</a> for a more detailed description of the dataset, the post-processing, and pointers to similar datasets).
