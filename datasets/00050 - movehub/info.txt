Description: <p>This dataset contains an election generated from indicator-based rankings of cities. The underlying city ranking data (<a href="https://kaggle.com/blitzr/movehub-city-rankings">kaggle.com/blitzr/movehub-city-rankings</a>) contains twelve quantitative indicators for the life quality in 216 different cities determined by movehub.com.  We created a single election where each city is a candidate and each vote corresponds to the ranking of the cities with respect to one of the indicators.</p> <p>Each patch contains the raw election and a post-processed version where some candidates and voters are deleted to make the election complete.</p> <p>Other indicator-based rankings have been used to create the country rankings and university rankings datasets.</p> <p>This dataset is part of a larger study by Boehmer and Schaar (see <a href="/BoSc22">this page</a> for a more detailed description of the dataset, the post-processing, and pointers to similar datasets).
