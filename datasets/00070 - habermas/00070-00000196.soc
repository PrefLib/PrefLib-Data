# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government is responsible for tackling online disinformation. Unfortunately, they have done nothing of the sort. Instead, they are the perpetrators of disinformation, most obviously during the Brexit campaign. We believe the government should be held accountable for this, and for their other mishandling of the pandemic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, online disinformation is on the rise. The government needs to take more action and not rely on educating the public. This needs to be followed up with meaningful actions and regulation of the internet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, the government has not done enough to tackle online disinformation, because members of the current UK government are responsible for one of the biggest disinformation campaigns in the history of the world leading to the Brexit vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government have made a half hearted attempt to educate people about disinformation online, but have been completely ineffective in reducing the spread of false information online. They are too distracted with Brexit to deal with anything else. The story above is completely fictional. It is a story I wrote in a creative writing class at university, in which we were asked to imagine that we were creating a new TV series for a particular network. In this case, the TV network was called Channel 123, and they only made documentaries on conspiracy theories.
