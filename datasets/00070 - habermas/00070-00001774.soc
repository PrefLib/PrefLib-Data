# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of providing free education to people who have been in the UK for over 5 years.  It was felt that this would help to integrate people into the UK, allow them to contribute to society and the economy, and provide a good example to their children.  It was also felt that it would be a good way to show that the UK is a welcoming and tolerant society.  It was felt that the 5 year limit was a good compromise between being fair to the immigrants and being fair to the UK taxpayer.  The group felt that it would be important to make it clear that this was a one-off offer and that immigrants should not expect to be able to claim free education indefinitely.  It was felt that this would be a good way to help integrate immigrants into society, and that this would be a good thing for society as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group were in general agreement that primary education should be provided to everyone in the UK for free, regardless of their place of birth or how long they have lived here. Secondary education was also agreed to be essential and to be free to anyone. After this point there was some division on what was to be provided for free. Some thought that further education and tertiary education should also be provided, while others did not agree with this. The view which was favoured by the majority of the group was that higher education should be provided if the person was planning to work in the UK. This would help them to integrate into the country, learn more about the UK and also enable them to become productive members of society.
