# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the minimum voting age should not be reduced to 16. Whilst it is important to get young people engaged with politics, there is the question of whether they lack the maturity required to play a part in the country's democratic decision making process. Although it could be argued that there are many adults who lack that maturity and knowledge of the political system. However, it is also important to note that young people are less likely to vote than older people, and that they often have a more liberal viewpoint. We do not think that they will always vote if the minimum voting age is reduced as it is not a particularly easy decision to vote and may be seen as rather burdensome by 16 year olds, who are faced with many pressures already. We do not think that they are better placed to vote than most adults because their experience of life and work and interacting with the public and different opinions, as well as their ability to weigh up opinions on multiple topics, is still developing. Finally, we are concerned that they do not take their voting seriously and tend to be guided by peers rather than by facts and opinions. Therefore, the minimum voting age should not be reduced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, the minimum voting age should not be reduced to 16. Young people are less likely to vote than older people, and they often have a more liberal viewpoint. This means that, even if the minimum voting age were reduced to 16, we would probably see more left leaning results in elections, which is not currently desired by a large proportion of the voting public. However, if you compare younger and older voters, older voters do tend to vote in greater numbers, perhaps because they are more worried about pensions or mortgage rates. However, with issues that matter to young people more frequently in the news and on the political agenda, it is hoped that there is growing interest among the younger population about engaging with politics and the political system. But for the moment, until more young people come to vote, we must put democracy at risk if we move the minimum voting age any lower than 18, in the hope that we increase electoral turnout to greater democratic levels, thus increasing support for the party (or parties) that work to implement what the majority wants.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, the minimum voting age should not be reduced to 16. Whilst it is important to get young people engaged with politics, there is the question of whether they lack the maturity required to play a part in the country's democratic decision making process. Although it could be argued that there are many adults who lack that maturity and knowledge of the political system. However, it is also important to note that young people are less likely to vote than older people, and that they often have a more liberal viewpoint. It is also important to note that many young people have not yet voted before the age of 18, and therefore would not be familiar with the voting system. It may be that it would therefore be more beneficial to encourage young people to vote as soon as they turn 18 so that they are more comfortable with voting.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, the minimum voting age should not be reduced to 16. Whilst it is important to get young people engaged with politics, there is the question of whether they lack the maturity required to play a part in the country's democratic decision making process. Although it could be argued that there are many adults who lack that maturity and knowledge of the political system. However, it is also important to note that young people are less likely to vote than older people, and that they often have a more liberal viewpoint. I disagree with the overall view of the group - feel that the age should be reduced. I feel that there are many young people who know a lot about politics, and the fact that they are often required to cover this in school means that they are better placed than most adults to have a sound opinion as they will not yet have forgotten concepts such as impartiality and bias in politics and history. I agree with the statement that there are many adults who can vote who aren't mature. I also agree with the fact that many young people have a more liberal viewpoint.
