# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I think we should as it is a creative outlet for many people and brings joy to people who go and enjoy the arts, as well as then providing more a livlihood for those who are passionate about it
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, more money should be put towards supporting working-class people in the arts. Currently, the arts scene in Britain is dominated by upper middle class and upper-class voices as they have parents that can support them whereas working-class people cannot afford to support themselves and this needs to change
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I think more money should be dedicated to the arts as it encourages people to be more creative. This can help people be more efficient and innovative at work and improve the overall happiness of the country. Starting with money in arts education, children can grow up appreciating the arts and the work that goes into it and this will help them later in life when it comes to job performance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I believe more money should go into the arts.  So many places where people are trained etc, are closing down through lack of funds and it's sad to see.  I think everyone should have access to the arts no matter what the medium is.
