# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - While the proposition of increasing the tax on meat to discourage the consumption of meat may be a noble one, the tax system is an ineffective means of altering consumer behaviour. In addition, while there are ethical concerns with meat consumption, we believe that the problems with it lie at the corporate level, and thus, any efforts to solve the issue should be directed at the source. We would instead like to see an increase in regulations on the raising of livestock, and taxing the large companies that are profiting from exploiting the environment and animals for their own gain. In the meantime, however, there should be more information given to consumers on the provenance of meat, and more research should be done on the effectiveness of lab-grown meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group ultimately agrees that the existing economic landscape of the meat industry is unsustainable, and that increased taxation of meat products does not constitute an acceptable method of solving the environmental and animal exploitation problems of our society. Instead, in order to preserve the health of our planet and satisfy the increasingly eco-conscious general public, the government must pursue stricter regulation over livestock and corporate entities, particularly those which have a history of exploiting animals, consumers, or the environment for profit. Furthermore, the proposed (and possibly over-eager) implementation of laws and policies which dissuade the consumption of meat by means of taxation on meat products would displace the emphasis from those corporations whose day-to-day activities are the real issue - corporations which should be taxed more heavily, fined or even criminalised, so that the livestock and meat products they generate are no longer as attractive to consumers as they are now.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be an increased tax on meat. The increased tax on meat will dissuade people from consuming meat. However, this is only the beginning, and we would like to see a larger focus on the corporations profiting from the meat industry. In order to achieve this, there needs to be increased regulation of the meat industry by the government, which will hopefully lead to more humane and sustainable conditions for the animals and for the environment.
