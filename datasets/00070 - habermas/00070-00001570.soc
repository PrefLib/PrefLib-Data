# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “We should tax the wealthy more to contribute to society and to help the less fortunate. This is because they have the most money, and can afford to pay more. The money that they pay is used to help others, which can only be seen as a good thing.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that we should tax the wealthy more. The reasons for this is that they are the people who have the most money and therefore can afford to pay more. Also, the tax that they pay will be used to benefit society and help those who are less fortunate. This is only fair, as the wealthy have more than enough money to live comfortably and can afford to pay more tax. This means that the tax will no longer be taken from the lower income and their standard of living will not be affected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should tax the wealthy more. This is because they are the people who have the most money and therefore can afford to pay more. Also, the tax that they pay will be used to benefit society and help those who are less fortunate. This is only fair, as the wealthy have more than enough money to live comfortably and can afford to pay more tax. This will also reduce the tax burden of those who earn less and therefore increase the amount of money that they can use to benefit themselves and their families.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The wealthy should be taxed more because the wealthier you are, the more you can afford to pay, and therefore should pay more. This will benefit society and enable people to have more of a level playing field in life.
