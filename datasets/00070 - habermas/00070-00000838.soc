# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should restrict the sale of fireworks to licensed vendors. Fireworks are dangerous and should be well regulated. You should be licensed to sell or store them because they are explosives and we need to ensure they are manufactured to high safety standards and then transported and stored safely and only sold responsibly to limit and prevent accidents and harm. We also believe there should be stricter usage requirements and limits linked to when they can be sold because of the negative effects they can have on animals and wildlife. We would also like to see a move to limiting the noise or better yet reducing the noise completely if that is possible.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Fireworks can be dangerous and should be well regulated. We believe they should be sold only by licensed vendors, and the retail sale should be restricted to those putting on authorised displays. It is ridiculous that anyone can essentially buy explosives over the counter. Fireworks are highly dangerous and they're far from essential at the average celebration. We believe there should be stricter usage requirements and limits linked to when they can be sold because of the negative effects they can have on animals and wildlife. We would also like to see a move to limiting the noise or better yet reducing the noise completely if that is possible.
