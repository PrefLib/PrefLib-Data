# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - This is VERY difficult, and I am on the fence purely because of "arts", if it was just for healthcare or even for something else, then I would say "maybe". Military is extremely important, as we can see in examples (unfortunately) from the current war between Russia and Ukraine. If we don't have the technology and gear, we will lose and a lot of lives. But then if we don't give enough money to help the struggling NHS system, we will lose many lives too, or people suffering. But because this question asks that it is ALSO for "ARTS" then my vote is a definite no, entertainment shouldn't cut the budget for things that truly matter.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I agree with this to a degree, I think we're spending a little too much on our military, but not by a lot. It's sad that we have to waste money on such areas and yet there's enough evil in the world such as Putin and his invasion of Ukraine or terrorists that it's a necessary spend to keep our country and our friends abroad safe. At the same time, we need to balance it with other spending, including the arts and health care sectors to look after and invest in our population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - coming from marrying into a military background and being on a camp i think there is nowhere enough spent on the military at all. It lacks in alot of aspects for the families left behind and the troops. I do believe that health care does need extra help but not the arts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - not on arts for sure, healthcare is definitely something we need to work on more intensively and everyone can agree with me on that on if they are invovled in NHS or visited GP recently
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - Military spending is a crucial part of the UK government spending. Without our military we would be even more open to attack.  I do agree that more money should be spent on healthcare and I believe that the people in society who can afford it, should pay something towards the healthcare they receive - it doesn't all need to be free. As for arts, while I can see the merit in it, there are far more pressing things for the country to spend money on.
