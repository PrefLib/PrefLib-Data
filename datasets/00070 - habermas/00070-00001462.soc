# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the testing of products on animals is unethical. There are alternatives to animal testing, such as computer modelling, tissue cultures and the use of human volunteers. The use of animals in medical research is more complicated. In some cases, such as cancer research, there are no alternatives to using animals. However, the number of animals used in medical research should be reduced as much as possible. The use of animals in medical research should be tightly regulated and monitored. Labels should be mandatory on all products, to allow the public to make an informed choice about what they are buying and using.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is ethical for humans to test on non-human animals to develop medicine for humans, if no other alternatives exist.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, it is not ethical for humans to test on non-human animals to develop medicine for humans. The benefits of doing so do not outweigh the suffering caused to animals. The only way in which it could be considered ethical is if there is no other way to develop the medicine and if the suffering caused to animals is kept to a minimum.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is unethical to use non-human animals to test for medicines for humans. However, due to the need for developing effective medicines for diseases such as cancer and other illnesses, the value of human lives outweighs the ethical considerations for animals used in testing medicines. If possible, alternatives to using non-human animals should be used to test the effectiveness and safety of medicines. There should be a clear process of how to use animals for research, including developing regulations for the use of animals for testing.
