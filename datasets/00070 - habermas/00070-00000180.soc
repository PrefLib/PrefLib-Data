# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The process of fracking for shale gas should not be permitted in the UK because it would not be environmentally friendly and there are alternative energy sources that can be used instead.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While the UK has a wealth of alternative sources of energy and natural gas, it has not developed to its full potential. Shale gas fracking has been shown to be an affordable and more easily accessible alternative to traditional forms of energy. Fracking also has a number of positive environmental impacts as it reduces our dependence on the burning of coal, and on other forms of fossil fuel. It has been shown to reduce air pollution, lower greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs. On the other hand, fracking is still a relatively new process. We are not sure of its long term effects. Fracking has been shown to cause small earthquakes and other environmental damage such as the use of vast quantities of water. There is also the possibility of contamination of groundwater and the extraction of rare metals such as mercury, lead, arsenic and cadmium. Due to these factors it is impossible to come to a unanimous consensus.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to fracking in principle. The main issue with fracking is that it is an unsustainable process. As it is fossil fuel it is only a short term solution and is just delaying the inevitable. The issue with fracking in the UK is that the UK has a very dense population, fracking is dangerous and it would have a serious effect on local communities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In conclusion, we feel that the question posed by the scenario requires that the future of the world be considered first and foremost. As such we believe that the environmental effects of fracking must be considered with an aim of reducing carbon emissions to prevent climate change. However, we do not feel that the answer to this question is simply ‘no’ and that if fracking can be performed in a sustainable way that meets environmental guidelines, this can be an alternative to other sources of gas production. We are unsure how to balance the environmental impact of fracking with the needs of our country and have come to the conclusion that the answer to this question must come from a thorough review of the facts. Our research into the facts showed that the environmental impact of fracking can be significant and includes; increased seismic activity, water pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, fracking was found to be responsible for around 1/3 of methane emissions in the US and has been shown to increase carbon dioxide emissions globally by 3%. We feel that the environmental effects of fracking are largely negative. However, we also recognise that fracking may be necessary as an alternative to other forms of gas extraction such as deep sea drilling. We are aware that the process of fra
