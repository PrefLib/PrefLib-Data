# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the government should not pass a law banning all use of plastics. We believe that there are many uses for plastics that are beneficial to our society, and we believe that there are responsible ways for us to recycle and reuse plastics that are no longer needed. We believe that the quality of substitutes for some plastic items do not fulfil the benefits that plastics bring. We believe that it should be the responsibility of the population to ensure all plastic they use are recycled once no longer in use. It is also a responsibility of all governments to ensure this process is made as easy and beneficial as possible. The government should also consider investing in infrastructure to assist with plastic recycling and in building awareness within society for the importance of recycling plastics.
