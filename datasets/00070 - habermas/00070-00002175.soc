# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We don't think that the number of MPs in the UK should be reduced. The number of MPs we have in the UK means that every constituency has a representative who can speak on behalf of the people who live in their area. If the number of MPs were reduced, then the size of constituencies would increase. This would mean that people living in the constituency would not have a representative who could speak on their behalf. It would also mean that the MP would have to travel a larger area, which would mean that they would not be able to spend as much time in their constituency, which would make them less accessible to the people who live there.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group was in agreement that there are currently too many MPs in the UK and that this number should be reduced. There are a number of reasons why this would be beneficial. The group felt that reducing the number of MPs would lead to less pointless shouting in Parliament, as each MP would be more able to put forward their view without clashing with others. There are also too many MPs in privileged backgrounds and a reduction in MPs would lead to more diverse backgrounds in Parliament, which would lead to a better representation of the views of the people. Finally, reducing the number of MPs would lead to the tax payer saving a lot of money, which would be beneficial for everyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be a review of the number of MPs in the UK. If there is to be a reduction, it should not be too significant as it is important that the people of the UK are represented by their elected officials. It is important that a wide range of people are represented, including people from different backgrounds, ethnicities, religions, ages, etc. It is important that there is a balance between the number of MPs and the number of people they represent. If there is to be a reduction in the number of MPs, it is important that this is not done in a way that reduces the diversity of MPs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The number of MPs in the UK should be reduced to save money. Reducing the number of MPs would mean that it would be harder for people living in certain areas to be represented in parliament. Reducing the number of MPs would mean combining current constituencies from different areas together, but the different areas may have different issues and political preferences. However, the amount of money saved would make it worth it.
