# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “We don’t believe that a separate classroom should be provided for dyslexic children, because it would make them feel like they were being put on the side.  Instead, we believe that schools should provide a teaching assistant for each class that is knowledgeable about dyslexia, who can help the children when they are struggling.  The children should also have access to various learning aids, such as coloured overlays for reading.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, I do not think that schools should have a dedicated classroom for students who are dyslexic. The reason for this is that the children will feel isolated from the rest of their peers and may feel that they are being singled out. This will have a negative impact on their confidence and self-esteem. The children should be in the classroom with their peers and have the support of a teaching assistant who will be able to help them with their reading and writing. The children will be able to see how their peers are coping with the work and will be able to learn from them. They will also be able to help their peers in return.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although some children with dyslexia may require extra support, we do not feel that having a dedicated classroom is the best way to help these children. We feel that by removing children with dyslexia from their classmates, it could hinder their social skills and lead to further isolation from their peers. The best way to help dyslexic children is to have a dedicated support teacher in the classroom, allowing for extra help when required, but still allowing the children to be part of the classroom. This is an extract from a report, which was written in the past tense and included the word, consensus.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, because the children would be separated from their peers and they would feel isolated.  The children would not be able to develop their strengths as they would not be in a classroom with other children.  The children would not be able to interact with other children and would not be able to develop their social skills.
