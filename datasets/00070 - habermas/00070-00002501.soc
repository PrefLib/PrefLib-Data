# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I am uncertain about AI. This will take away peoples jobs. This is also a job that needs a human to decide and balance right from wrong. I do not trust AI and where we are heading
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: AI is increasingly being used in society and will no doubt soon be entering many more aspects of society. While impressive it is clear to anyone that has used it that it still has many flaws and this is my main reservation when it comes to utilising it in something as nuanced as the judicial system. I feel that the possibility for mistakes and the severtiy of the consequences to people makes the use of AI in the judicial system, at least for now, a bad idea.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The AI may not know the ins and outs of the case causing a miss judgement. It also does not have the human emotions or ability to recognise them weel which could impact the case. It could rule unfairly. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I think it is slightly unethical to use AI in the judicial system. Certainly, in its current guise. There is a lot of evidence that AI fails to give correct information. While it would take human emotion out of the decision making process in the judicial system, I don't believe it can be properly relied upon without a lot of work and refinement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I do not think that it is ethical to use AI in the judicial system unless it is for references or an argument. The court system relies on opinions and real life accounts for something that has happened so it should rely on opinions/speeches that come from witnesses themselves and not from an AI.
