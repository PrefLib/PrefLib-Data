# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Capitalism is not a fair and sustainable economic system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Capitalism in its current form is not fair or sustainable.  However, capitalism is not a bad idea, and if it were more fairly distributed it could be both fair and sustainable.  We believe that capitalism is the best system that has been tried so far.  There are no viable alternatives to capitalism at this point.  If we were to change the system, it would be necessary to change the way people think.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Capitalism is not a fair and sustainable economic system. The market economy creates a gap between the rich and poor. The rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. The current economic system has created more problems than solutions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Capitalism is not a fair or sustainable economic system in isolation. The hoarding of wealth by a few and the increasingly difficult conditions of the many show us this. Capitalism tempered and ameliorated by socialism may be the best system we can hope for. This would allow for innovation and a fair return on labour while ensuring those who are struggling are assisted. Late Stage Capitalism (considered by many to be what we are in now) results in suffering and unfairness in society.
