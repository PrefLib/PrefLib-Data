# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should encourage the use of electric cars by offering tax breaks to their owners. This would be an incentive for people to want to purchase a vehicle that is safer for the environment. The government would also need to make investments in the infrastructure for electric cars such as charging ports to make sure the increasing amount of vehicles can be handled. The tax breaks should have a fixed duration, for example 2 - 3 years, so that the government wouldn't lose too much tax income, or else this would affect the budget in other public services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should encourage the use of electric cars by offering tax breaks to their owners, in order to reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality and reduce noise pollution. However, in order to reduce tax loss, this tax break should only apply to new electric cars, and have a fixed duration, for example 3 years.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In principle, yes the government should encourage the use of electric cars by offering tax breaks to their owners. But this is just one part of a wider strategy that needs to be implemented in order to achieve this aim. To begin with, the government would need to invest in the infrastructure of electric cars, in order to make them affordable to all who wish to own one. On the one hand, this financial incentive to own an electric car would help reduce the amount of pollution from non-electric cars and so would benefit the environment and society as a whole. On the other hand, the tax breaks would need to be limited in duration, otherwise the government would lose an excessive amount of tax revenue, which would have a negative effect on other public services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the government offering tax breaks to owners of electric cars. The group felt that this would be a good incentive for people to purchase electric cars and would also help to reduce the amount of carbon emissions from vehicles. The group also felt that the government should invest in the infrastructure for electric cars, such as charging ports, to ensure that the increasing amount of vehicles can be handled.
