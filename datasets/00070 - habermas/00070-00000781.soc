# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, gambling should not be banned but should be restricted. The gambling companies should have some control over how much people can gamble, perhaps limiting the amount of money that can be deposited into accounts and limiting the amount of time that can be spent gambling. Advertisements for gambling should be limited. Gambling should not be available to people with a low credit score or to students.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, gambling should not be banned but there should be some restrictions placed on it to protect those with addictions or prevent people from developing an addiction.  People should not be able to take out credit to gamble with and must not be able to pay with credit cards.   Advertising for gambling should be limited.  It should not be banned completely as many people enjoy it and it is not a problem if people gamble responsibly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not ban gambling as it is a popular pastime for many people. We should restrict gambling in some way, however. People with low credit scores should not be allowed to gamble, and the amount of money that people are allowed to gamble with should be limited. This would prevent people from getting into debt and becoming addicted to gambling. Gambling should also be restricted in some way in the media. It should not be advertised on television before the watershed, and there should be less advertising of gambling in general.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We don't think that gambling should be banned as it is a fun activity for many people. However, it is important to restrict it to a certain extent as some people can become addicted and this can cause problems for them and their families. We think that people should not be able to gamble with credit and should be able to gamble only a certain amount of money. This should be decided by the individual and is their responsibility. Gambling should also not be advertised to young people as they may be more susceptible to addiction.
