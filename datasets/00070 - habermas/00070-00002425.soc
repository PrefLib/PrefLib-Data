# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of an increase in the minimum wage to £20 per hour. The majority of the group felt that the current minimum wage of £10.50 per hour is not a living wage and that the increase to £20 per hour would allow individuals to live comfortably. However, it was noted that the increase would have to be funded by the government and would lead to an increase in inflation. It was also noted that the increase would have a detrimental effect on small businesses who would be unable to afford to employ staff at the increased rate. The consensus view was that the increase would be good for individuals but bad for businesses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a minimum wage increase, however we felt that the increase should be gradual rather than a sudden increase to £20 per hour. We felt that a sudden increase would be detrimental to businesses and would fuel inflation. A gradual increase would be more manageable and would not have such a negative impact on the economy. We felt that the increase should be gradual and should be increased by a small amount each year. This would be more manageable for businesses and would not fuel inflation. This would be a win-win situation for both employers and employees. Employees would be better off and employers would not be adversely affected. We felt that the increase should be to £15 per hour, which would be more manageable for businesses and would not fuel inflation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group of participants have come to the consensus view that we do not feel the minimum wage should be increased to £20 per hour. We feel this is too much of a jump from the current £10.50. We feel that it would cause small businesses to go under and the consequences of this would be detrimental to the economy. We feel the best way to increase minimum wage is gradually. We feel that if it was increased to £13 per hour that would be more beneficial. We feel that this would not be as detrimental to businesses as it is not as much of a jump from £10.50. We feel that a gradual increase would be more sustainable for businesses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of a minimum wage increase, however we felt that the increase should be gradual rather than a sudden increase to £20 per hour. We felt that a sudden increase would be detrimental to businesses and would fuel inflation. A gradual increase would be more manageable and would not have such a negative impact on the economy. We felt that the increase should be gradual and should be increased by a small amount each year. This would be more manageable for businesses and would not fuel inflation. This would also allow for more jobs to be created as more people would be able to afford to work. We also felt that there would be more tax revenue and less unemployment if the increase was gradual.
