# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should provide free contraception to everyone. The reasons for this are: -It would reduce the number of unwanted teen and general pregnancies. -It would reduce the abortion rate as fewer women would opt for that as a consequence of unwanted pregnancy. -It could also save money in long term. -It would be the ethical way to do to support people with imminent medical needs. -Contraception should not be a choice for the rich and poor and should be inclusive and accessible to everyone. -If we are to charge women for the pill, coil or injections then many may not be able to afford it and the country could be faced with a lot of unwanted pregnancies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of free contraception. There were some reservations about condoms being free for everyone as this could lead to increased promiscuity. The group also felt that there should be more education on the use of contraception.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that the government should provide free contraception to everyone to ensure it is accessible to all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It was agreed that the government should provide free contraception to everyone. The government should remove all stigmas around contraception. This includes contraception for young people and sex workers. The government should also provide a range of different contraceptive methods to everyone who wants them, including condoms and the morning after pill. This will be of benefit to the economy in the long term as it will reduce the number of people living in poverty. It will also lead to fewer unwanted pregnancies, which is a win for everyone.
