The amount of information that is available online and through other means means that people need to have a right to privacy in order to protect themselves and their information. The right to privacy is also a human right and it is important that this is respected in order to protect people. The only time that this should be breached is in cases where people are suspected of committing a crime. The issue of privacy is also an issue of freedom of speech and expression and it is important that this is protected in order to allow people to express their views freely.

An example would be where an individual is suspected of committing a crime. It is important to recognise that in these circumstances, an individual's right to privacy may be breached in order to protect others and to ensure that justice is served. This is an important part of the balance between the rights of individuals and the rights of society.
