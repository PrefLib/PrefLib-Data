# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a strong argument for using only recyclable cups at a social gathering. If the cups are plastic, they should be made of a type that is recyclable. The best option is probably a cup made of paper. The cost of replacing disposable cups with reusable cups is not high and people should therefore try to purchase their own reusable cups.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is not ideal from an environmental perspective, but it is understandable that a social gathering may require a large volume of glassware that many people do not have. Therefore, it is acceptable to very occasionally use disposable plastic cups to enable a large gathering. However, if someone were to host large gatherings routinely, it would be less acceptable to keep on disposing of plastic cups.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, it is not ok to use disposable plastic cups at a social gathering. The issue of single use plastics is one that needs to be tackled and there are many alternatives that can be used. The use of single use plastics needs to be reduced across the board.
