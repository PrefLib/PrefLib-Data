# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections. The main reason for this was that local elections affect issues which make a difference to UK citizens. Why therefore give influence to voters who won't be affected by the results of their votes? Local elections should be about addressing issues which are of concern to local residents and about improving the situation of local residents. It is about community members having a say in their own lives. However, the group did acknowledge that there may be some circumstances in which it would be appropriate to allow non-UK citizens to vote in local elections. For example, in cases where the non-UK citizen has been resident in the UK for a long time and has contributed to the local community, it would be appropriate to allow them to vote. The group also acknowledged that there are many non-UK citizens who live and work in the UK in this way, so they do deserve a say, however, there would need to be some documentation in place to ensure that they are voting fairly and honestly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In principle, it is not a good idea to allow non-UK citizens to vote in local elections, because local elections affect issues which make a difference to UK citizens. Why therefore give influence to voters who won't be affected by the results of their votes? Local elections should be about addressing issues which are of concern to local residents and about improving the situation of local residents. It is about community members having a say in their own lives. However, there are some circumstances in which it would be fair to allow non-UK citizens to vote in local elections. If the person for example is applying for a visa and wants to stay in the UK he should have a right to address policies that affect him but if they are only staying a short time then it is not fair they have a say in policies that will affect those living in the country. I think each case has to be assessed individually.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections. The group felt that local elections were about giving the local community a voice in their local affairs and that this voice should be reserved for those who live in the community. The group felt that if non-UK citizens were allowed to vote in local elections it would be difficult to determine what level of commitment they had to the local community and whether their votes were being cast in the interests of the local community or in their own interests. The group felt that it would be difficult to ensure that the voting system was being used fairly and honestly if non-UK citizens were allowed to vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group of participants were in general opposed to the idea of allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections.
