# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Local authorities are doing enough to encourage cycling. Some cities have better cycling infrastructure than others, however most are getting better. Sometimes the implementation of this infrastructure is not great, as cycle lanes often end randomly, and sometimes are not well maintained which results in cyclists using the road with cars. We should focus more on completing and maintaining cycling infrastructure before continuing to make new, partial cycle paths. However, generally speaking we think most local authorities seem to push quite a lot to encourage people to cycle. We think that local authorities could do more to encourage people to cycle, by incentivizing and encouraging 'Cycle to Work and School' schemes. We also think that cars should be more considerate of cyclists, and that cyclists should be made more aware of cycle paths.

Local authorities could also encourage and incentivize people to cycle - like encouraging 'Cycle to Work and School' schemes. Cars and bikes should both be able to share the road, and both drivers and cyclists should be educated on how to safely drive or cycle, respectively. Public transport is often the safest way to travel for cyclists, and local authorities should continue to work on improving public transport as an alternative to driving.

Sometimes the implementation of this infrastructure is not great, as cycle lanes often end randomly, and sometimes are not well maintained which results in cyclists using the road with cars. We think local authorities should maintain existing cycle lanes better before making any new paths, and we think individuals need to use these cycle paths more.
