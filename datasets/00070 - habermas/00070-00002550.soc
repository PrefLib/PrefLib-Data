# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is no reason why any country should be given unconditional support. It should be decided on a case by case basis. As if not, we would then be obliged to support something bad. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I do not think so. UK should solve its own problems first and make sure the economy is doing well and build a good relationship with other nations. The UK can support USA but it should not be unconditional.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: i dont believe unconditonal support is the correct course of action i believe it is important to approach each situation with critical thinking and coming to conclusions, not blindly follow someone else's direction and decisons especially on an international level.  unconditional support could cost the UK face in the international community, which has suffered enough in recent times. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I think that the relationship between the UK and the US is very important, and that we should support one another, however, any action should be considered very carefully and not entered into just because of our positive relationship. We shouldn't follow each other blindly, but should give any help necessary, within reason.
