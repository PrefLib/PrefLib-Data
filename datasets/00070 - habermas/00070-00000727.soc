# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The inclusion of indefinite leave to remain in the asylum seeking policy is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of the social, economic, and political impact. It should be evaluated alongside the government's commitment to protect vulnerable groups and ensure a fair and just system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the UK asylum seeking policy should not include an indefinite leave to remain. The policy should ensure that asylum seekers are not subjected to unfair treatment or persecution and that their human rights are not violated. However, it should not provide a strong incentive for people to abuse the system by providing indefinite leave to remain.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Our asylum seeking policy should include an indefinite leave to remain.  Asylum seekers are displaced due to life threatening situations and should be able to settle in a new environment without the fear of having to return to where they may be harmed.  Allowing them to settle and find work would also ease the stain of benefits provision and put to rest some of the extreme views of asylum seekers only arriving in the UK to gain benefits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The inclusion of indefinite leave to remain in the asylum seeking policy is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of the social, economic, and political impact. It should be evaluated alongside the government's commitment to protect vulnerable groups and ensure a fair and just system.”
