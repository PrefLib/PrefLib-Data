# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In principle, the use of AI in the judicial system is a good idea.  It would be useful to have a system that could take all the facts into account in a case and come to a conclusion based on those facts.  However, it is very difficult to design such a system in a way that it would not have some sort of bias.  It would be difficult to ensure that the system would not be biased against certain types of people, for example people from a certain socio-economic background or people of a certain race.  The system would also need to be designed in such a way that it would be difficult to hack.  If it was possible to change the outcome of a case by hacking the system, this would be a major problem.  Therefore, it is probably not a good idea to use AI in the judicial system at the moment, but it might be in the future when AI is more advanced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While using AI in the judicial system has the potential to reduce human bias in decision making, the system could also be biased if it is not designed with the right input data and cross checked by humans. There is also a risk of hackers interfering with the system and its outputs. The system would therefore need to be closely monitored and would also need to be able to be overruled by humans if there is any doubt. The group of participants discussed whether the consensus view had been sufficiently constructed, or whether it should be revised. The group decided to revise the statement as follows: AI has the potential to improve decision making in the judicial system, but care needs to be taken to ensure that AI systems are unbiased and can be overruled by humans in the event of doubt.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the use of AI in the judicial system would be a good thing, however, it is important to ensure that it is used in the right way. The use of AI in the judicial system could help to reduce human biases and prejudices, however, it is important to ensure that the data that is fed into the AI is not biased.
