# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should make it easier for people to switch energy suppliers. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, it would allow people to be more proactive in their energy use, allowing them to choose suppliers based on a number of factors such as price, environmental impact and customer service. Secondly, it would allow people to be more environmentally friendly in their energy use, by allowing them to choose suppliers that provide more green energy. Thirdly, it would allow people to save money on their energy bills, by allowing them to choose suppliers that provide the best value for money. Finally, it would allow people to hold energy suppliers to account, by allowing them to switch suppliers if they are unhappy with the service they are receiving.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should make it easier for people to switch energy suppliers. The whole process is too complicated and this puts people off switching. It is also difficult to find out which energy supplier is the cheapest and this is another reason that people do not switch. The government should make the whole process of switching very simple and easy to do. There should be an independent website that lists all of the energy suppliers, their prices and customer satisfaction ratings. This website should also provide an easy to use comparison tool that allows people to compare different energy suppliers based on their own specific needs. The government should also make it a legal requirement for energy suppliers to make it very easy for people to contact them to make complaints, queries and to switch to a different energy supplier.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should make it easier for people to switch to other energy suppliers. This is because it will make the energy market more competitive, meaning that energy companies will have to lower their prices in order to attract customers. It will also allow people to make their own choices about which energy suppliers they use, whether this is on financial grounds or the environmental impact of the energy suppliers. The government should also make the switching process as simple as the current account switch programme, to hold energy suppliers to account.
