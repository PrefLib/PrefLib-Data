# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While the concept of removing right turns is a very interesting one and we appreciate the rationale behind it, we do not believe that banning right turns is a practical solution. We believe that removing right turns would require more time and energy to implement than the problems that it would solve. However, it is clear that accidents do happen because of right turns. Therefore, we suggest that instead of removing right turns we promote better education and awareness about right turns, and their correct use. We also suggest that rather than a complete ban on right turns we consider removing only right turns that are clearly causing an issue with traffic flow.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although right turns can cause accidents and congestion, we should not ban them. Instead we should make the roads wider, so there is room for vehicles to turn, and we should educate drivers to look properly before turning.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, the group of participants have come to the consensus opinion that we should not ban right turns in central London. The reason for this is that it would cause more problems than it would solve. The problem of congestion in London is not caused by right turns, but by other factors such as poor infrastructure, poor planning and a lack of investment in public transport. If we were to ban right turns, it would mean that people would have to travel further to get to their destination, which would cause more pollution and congestion. The ban would also cause more problems for people who are used to making right turns and would have to get used to a new system. This would cause more problems and would be a waste of time and energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, we should not ban right turns in central London. This is because it would cause too much chaos, and would inconvenience too many people. The best way to deal with the issue is to improve education and awareness of the dangers of right turns, and to improve the design of roads to make it easier and safer to make right turns.
