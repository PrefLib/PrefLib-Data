# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Wolves have a part to play in nature. They are part of the food chain and would not be there if they didn't. If wolves are introduced back into the highlands then it would help to control the deer population which would also help other animals and plants. There would be concerns for the farming community but hopefully there would be a way to compensate them if they lost livestock. If the Scottish government could prove that there would be a benefit for re-introducing wolves then I think it should happen.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In Scotland, the forests are now over populated with deer, which is causing major damage to the environment. The over population of deer are causing damage to forests and not allowing new trees and plants to grow. By reintroducing wolves back into Scotland would help control the deer population. The wolves would not only eat the deer but also small rodents which would cause more damage to the forests.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “I am not in favour of reintroducing wolves to the Scottish Highlands, as it is likely to be detrimental to other species and could result in substantial losses to farmers.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The jury was divided on this topic, but after a good debate we all agreed that we need to introduce more predators in the Highlands to deal with the over population of deer. We all agreed that the population of deer should be reduced. However, we also discussed how other factors might affect the reintroduction of wolves, such as the effect on other wildlife. A few of us felt that it was not a straightforward decision, and that we should wait to see the effects of the Scottish government's latest measures to control deer populations before making a decision on whether to reintroduce wolves or other predators. However, we felt that the government needs to start thinking about these issues now so that if the population of deer does not fall, they have a back up plan.
