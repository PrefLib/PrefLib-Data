# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While we can see the good intentions behind giving disadvantaged groups admission priority, we feel that universities should be careful to not let their academic standards slip. We believe that students should be given priority based on merit, and we feel that the only way that we can give disadvantaged groups the same amount of help is by giving more funding to universities. This will allow them to help disadvantaged students with the resources that they need to do well, without letting the standards slip." The consensus statement is rather balanced. It incorporates the strong feelings of Participant 1 and 2 that universities should be giving disadvantaged groups admission priority, but also incorporates the concerns of Participant 3 and 4 that academic standards should not slip. The group also included the suggestion of Participant 5 that funding should be increased to help the disadvantaged, so that the standards don't slip.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Universities should not give disadvantaged groups admission priority. They should be open and fair to everyone. It should be about skill and not money. It shouldn't matter what group they're apart of. It should be fair for everyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although it is important to consider disadvantaged groups, universities should not give them admission priority. Instead, universities should provide the necessary support to disadvantaged groups so that they can gain admission on merit. This will be more beneficial for the disadvantaged groups in the long run, as they will have gained admission on their own merit and not as a result of being part of a disadvantaged group.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Universities should not give admission priority to disadvantaged groups. Doing so would damage the academic standing of the university and so admissions should be done solely on merit.
