# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we should not encourage everyone to get a degree. A degree is not for everyone and not everyone has the right qualities to get a degree. In the past, university degrees were used to break into professional careers that required a higher level of learning. However, now we have many degrees by average universities that are run as cash cows. Students who would have been better off doing an internship or apprenticeship are encouraged at a young age to get themselves into significant debt for a degree that will not progress their career in any way. In addition, they are unlikely to pay off their student loan if their ultimate potential career is low-paid, meaning the taxpayer has to foot the bill for students going to university for the sake of it. At the same time, we have discouraged people from getting things like trades like plumbing etc which pay well and are solid careers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we should not encourage everyone to get a degree. The quality of degrees has dropped significantly in recent years and many are now not worth the paper they are written on. This has led to many people graduating with a degree that is of little use to them in their career and saddled with a large student loan debt that they will never be able to pay off. This is unfair to the individual and to the taxpayer. We should be encouraging young people to go to university if they have a specific career in mind that requires a degree. Otherwise, they would be better off doing an apprenticeship or internship in the career they want to pursue.
