# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Artificial intelligence can be a useful tool for businesses in recruitment and promotion, but human oversight is necessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Businesses should be able to use AI to help in their recruitment process but not to the extent that they can no longer have an eye to eye discussion with a potential candidate to determine if they would fit in and work well with the team. The use of AI should be to support the overall process but should not be the decision-maker as it does not have a human element and may not be as effective at reading between the lines or being empathetic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that a business should be able to use AI to filter through applications. This will save time for both the business and applicants and is an overall positive process. However, we feel that there should be a human element to the final stages of the recruitment process in order to ensure that the correct candidate is hired.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a balance between human oversight and the use of AI. It should be used for initial candidate screening. In the future, the use of AI may need to be tightened as companies can sometimes go overboard with its use.
