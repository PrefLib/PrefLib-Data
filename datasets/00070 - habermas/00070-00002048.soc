# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK government should take action to reduce the prevalence of guns and gun ownership in the UK. The UK has some of the strictest gun ownership laws in the world, but we should not rest on our laurels. Gun crime in the UK is on the rise and we should be trying to tackle this with hard punishments and education to those people involved in the crimes. The UK has more that it can do to ensure that ghost guns and other illegal weapons are found and destroyed. The UK also needs to talk more about this issue as it is not only guns that are the problem, there is a lot of knife crimes happening and often it is involving children, for me that shows that we need to make a better job educating children regarding safety and peace.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK government should take action to reduce the prevalence of guns and gun ownership in the UK. The government has already made great steps in the right direction, but there is still more that can be done. It is vital to ensure that guns and gun ownership are taken very seriously. The world is becoming more violent than ever, there is children shooting children everywhere and it is down to the police and government to ensure people don't have any access to guns. We also need to talk more about this issue as it is not only guns that are the problem, there is a lot of knife crimes happening and often it is involving children, for me that shows that we need to make a better job educating children regarding safety and peace. Gun ownership in its self is not the issue, it is the people who own the guns that need more controls.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although guns are illegal in the UK we do have a surprising raising number of guns around and it is down to the UK government to tackle this issue. The world is becoming more violent than ever, there is children shooting children everywhere and it is down to the police and government to ensure people don't have any access to guns. We also need to talk more about this issue as it is not only guns that are the problem, there is a lot of knife crimes happening and often it is involving children, for me that shows that we need to make a better job educating children regarding safety and peace.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the UK has very good gun control laws. However, we must be aware that gun crime is on the rise in the UK and this is a worrying trend. The government should do more to tackle this issue. In particular, we need to ensure that all guns in circulation are accounted for. We also need to ensure that we educate the public on the dangers of guns and gun ownership.
