# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “I think that we should legalise some drugs for recreational use, however we should not legalise any drugs that are harmful or have a high potential for addiction. Drugs that are legalised should have an age limit, as they may cause harm to younger people who may use them, and the drug should only be sold in designated stores where there is an age limit and it is under strict supervision. This will allow some people who are looking to use drugs for medical purposes to be able to do so and it will reduce the amount of drug related crime, as people will not have to resort to crime to obtain the drugs. However, there are some drugs that I do not think should be legalised for recreational use, as they can cause damage to the body and the mind. However, if these drugs were to be used for medical purposes, then I think they should be able to be used. However, I think there should be a high level of regulation for these drugs.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the legalisation of drugs is a good idea. It would reduce the crime associated with the drug trade, and reduce the harm to individuals from drug use. The legalisation of cannabis is a good idea, as it is not very harmful. It would also reduce the number of people in prison for possession of cannabis. However, we should not legalise other drugs such as cocaine or heroin, as these are more harmful and could lead to addiction. The legalisation of drugs should be considered on a case-by-case basis, and the legalisation of any drug should be preceded by a thorough review of the evidence for and against the legalisation of that drug.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of legalising some drugs for recreational use. However, it was stressed that the legalisation of drugs should be done with caution, and that a thorough review of the short and long term effects of the drugs in question should be carried out first. The group also felt that the legalisation of some drugs could help to reduce the burden on the legal system, as it would reduce the number of people being arrested and prosecuted for drug offences.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Some drugs should be legalised for recreational use. We should not be too scared of what these drugs can do to us, and should be open to listening to evidence that they may not be as bad as we think. For example, marijuana is a relatively harmless drug that could be helpful for people with mental health issues.
