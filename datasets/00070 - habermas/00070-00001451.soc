# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should restrict what children can see on the internet. The government should introduce a scheme whereby individuals need to show age evidence to view certain sites,
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, we believe that the government should impose restrictions on what children under the age of 12 can do and/or see on the internet. This is because the internet is a very dangerous place, especially for children. They are very vulnerable and are at risk of being groomed by predators and bullies, and are also at risk of being exposed to very explicit and violent content. It is also very easy for children to access things on the internet that they don’t fully understand, and this can be very damaging for their future development. In our opinion, age verification should be a must for any site that displays explicit content. We believe that parents should also have a responsibility for monitoring their child’s internet use. However, this can be very difficult to do in a busy household where parents are working and children are expected to be responsible for themselves. If parents know that the government has restrictions in place to prevent children from accessing harmful material, then this will hopefully help to put their minds at ease.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Yes, the government should restrict what children can see and do on the internet. This is because children can be very vulnerable and can be easily influenced by what they see. The government should introduce age verification systems to ensure that children can only see age appropriate content. The government should also introduce heavy restrictions on the use of the internet by children under 12 years old. This is because they can be easily influenced by what they see on the internet and this could have a lasting impact on their psychological development. Parents should also take responsibility for monitoring their children’s use of the internet. This is because the government cannot be everywhere and parents should take responsibility for their children.”
