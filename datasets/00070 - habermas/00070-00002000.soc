# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: While schools may not feel that they have enough time to teach everything, philosophy should definitely be on their curriculum.  It could be taught through other subjects such as English, to try and save time, yet should still receive enough teaching time to be well understood by the students.  The subject may be of less value than other subjects, such as maths and science, yet it is still very important to the development of the student’s thinking and decision making skills.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Schools should not give more time to teaching philosophy.  This is because although philosophy is a valuable subject, it is not as valuable as some other subjects.  There is a lot of philosophy covered in English already, for example when studying works by writers such as Shakespeare, and in a world that is becoming increasingly focused on science and technology, there are other more important subjects to teach.  If schools have time to spare, it should be spent on science or mathematics.
