# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group felt that it is more important to be a good person than to be a happy person. Being a good person can lead to happiness, but it is not a requirement. A good person is one who is virtuous, kind, compassionate, and honest. They do not seek to harm others and will help those in need. Being a good person is a choice, and it is one that will have positive effects on those around you. It is also something that will make you feel good about yourself. The group agreed that there are many things in life that can make you happy, but that being a good person is something that is more long-lasting and more meaningful.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: A good person is a happy person.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In my opinion, the two concepts go hand in hand, and I think a good person would be a happy person. However, in regards to the question asked, I do believe that it is more important to be a good person. I believe that happiness is a subjective thing, and it is something that varies from person to person. We also debated the definition of what a 'good person' is.  The group concluded that the definition of 'good' is also subjective.  I believe that it is most important to be a 'good person' because being a good person can have a positive effect on other peoples lives. I think that this is most important, as this will, in turn, make you happy. This is because being a good person and doing good deeds will create a positive impact on people around you, and this will make you feel happy that you have made a positive impact on other peoples lives. Therefore, I believe that it is most important to be a good person.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the conclusion that it is more important to be a good person than to be a happy person. Being a good person will make you happy in the long run, but being happy will not necessarily make you a good person.
