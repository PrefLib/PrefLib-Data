# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, the group has come to the consensus opinion that the UK government should subsidise petrol prices to bring them down. The majority of participants agreed that this would help the public, especially those on lower incomes who rely on personal transport to get to work or other essential activities. It would also help the economy as people would have more money to spend on other things. However, one participant pointed out that this would need to be funded by tax revenues and this would likely mean cuts from the budget elsewhere.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the decision that the UK government should subsidise petrol prices to bring them down. The price of petrol has increased dramatically over the last decade and this has caused a lot of problems for the public. The increase in prices has caused a lot of people to have to change their lifestyle. We feel that it is the governments responsibility to help the public in these situations and subsidising the price of petrol is the best way to do this. The government should subsidise the price of petrol as this will help to bring the prices down. We feel that this is a good way to help the public and it will also help to stimulate the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, the group of participants feel that the UK government should subsidise petrol prices to bring them down. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that it would make life easier for those who need to drive for work and for other essential activities. It would also stimulate the economy, making it easier for people to travel to work and for businesses to transport goods. It would also make life easier for those who live in more rural areas where public transport is not an option. The group of participants feel that it would be a very positive move for the government to subsidise petrol prices.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the UK government subsidising petrol prices to bring them down. They felt that it would be beneficial for the economy as it would help those who are less well off and it would stimulate activity. Lower fuel prices would stimulate economic activity as consumers would find the costs of transportation, goods and services to be cheaper. High fuel usage and consumption would also generate tax revenue creating a positive economic feedback loop. However, it would have to be funded through tax revenues and this would likely mean cuts from the budget elsewhere. Fossil fuels are also bad for the enviroment and we live in an era where their usage is intentionally in decline in favour of more green options.
