# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of limiting the amount of junk food that can be displayed in supermarkets. The reasoning for this was that it would be a step in the right direction to tackle the obesity crisis in the UK. It would also make it easier for people to make healthier choices and help to reduce the amount of junk food consumed. However, the group did not think that the amount of junk food should be completely banned from supermarkets, as this would be an infringement on peoples rights to choose what they eat. Instead, the group felt that there should be a limit on the amount of junk food that can be displayed, and that healthier options should be more prominently displayed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of limiting the amount of junk food that can be displayed in supermarkets. The reasoning for this is that it is very easy for people to buy junk food, and the health implications of eating junk food are very serious. The group was also in favour of making healthy food more available in supermarkets, as this would encourage people to buy healthy food. The group also felt that the government should be more active in promoting healthy eating.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that junk food should be limited in supermarkets. The levels of obesity in this country are very high and we believe that supermarkets have a large role to play in this. We believe that the supermarkets should limit the amount of junk food that they display and also increase the amount of healthy options that they have. We believe that this will have a positive impact on the health of the nation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that the amount of junk food in supermarkets should be limited. The health implications of junk food are very serious, and the NHS costs the tax payer billions of pounds each year due to unhealthy lifestyle choices. The levels of obesity are very high in this country second only to the USA and I think that is a problem that needs to be addressed. The amount of junk food displayed in supermarkets is a direct contributor to the problem.
