# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The average Briton’s attitude to the Chinese government is hostile, but not unjustifiably so. The Chinese government is responsible for appalling human rights abuses, including their treatment of Uyghurs, and they are known to spy on the West. Furthermore, their lack of action and dishonesty at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic arguably helped the virus travel around the world instead of being contained. However, the average Briton is largely uneducated about China’s government, as we don't get much information on them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There is hostility towards the Chinese government, but it is not unjustified. The Chinese government is responsible for appalling human rights abuses, including their treatment of Uyghurs, and they are known to spy on the West. Furthermore, their lack of action and dishonesty at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic arguably helped the virus travel around the world instead of being contained. However, the average Briton is largely uneducated about China's government, as we don't get much information on them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The average Briton’s attitude to the Chinese government is one of hostility, although this is not a very strongly-held opinion. This is because the average Briton is largely uneducated on the affairs of the Chinese government, and so is largely unaware of their actions. The average Briton is also largely unaffected by the actions of the Chinese government, and so does not have a strong opinion on them. However, the average Briton is aware that the Chinese government is responsible for appalling human rights abuses, including their treatment of Uyghurs, and they are known to spy on the West. The average Briton is also aware that the Chinese government is responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, and so is hostile towards them for this reason.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The average Briton’s attitude to the Chinese government is hostile, but not unjustifiably so. The Chinese government is responsible for appalling human rights abuses, including their treatment of Uyghurs, and they are known to spy on the West. Furthermore, their lack of action and dishonesty at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic arguably helped the virus travel around the world instead of being contained. The average Briton is also largely uneducated about China and its government, as we don't get much information on them.
