# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a ban on the use of plastic in disposable containers. This is good for the environment as plastic takes a very long time to degrade and has limited recyclability. However the difficulty arises in that plastic containers are cheap to manufacture and deliver. If they are to be banned then companies will need to use more expensive environmentally friendly options such as foil or paper. This cost ultimately is likely to be passed onto the end user/consumer and this may therefore disproportionately impact the poorest in society. This issue could be alleviated by the government subsidising the cost of the more expensive alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a ban on the use of plastic in disposable containers. This is good for the environment as plastic takes a very long time to degrade and has limited recyclability. However the difficulty arises in that plastic containers are cheap to manufacture and deliver. If they are to be banned then companies will need to use more expensive environmentally friendly options such as foil or paper. This cost ultimately is likely to be passed onto the end user/consumer and this may therefore disproportionately impact the poorest in society. This is a very important issue that needs to be addressed.

This is good for the environment as plastic takes a very long time to degrade and has limited recyclability. However the difficulty arises in that plastic containers are cheap to manufacture and deliver. If they are to be banned then companies will need to use more expensive environmentally friendly options such as foil or paper. This cost ultimately is likely to be passed onto the end user/consumer and this may therefore disproportionately impact the poorest in society. This cost could be subsidised by the government in order to help the poorest in society and to help the environment.
