# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the minimum wage to £15 per hour. The majority of participants thought that it was necessary to help the most vulnerable to cope with rising energy costs and to stop food poverty. The majority of participants also thought that it was necessary to encourage people to return to or stay in work. One participant thought that increasing the minimum wage to £15 per hour would not solve our problems, it would only increase inflation. However, there was not sufficient support in the group for this point of view. Most participants felt that increasing the minimum wage would not have such an inflationary effect on the economy, so in general it would be beneficial. A gradual increase in the minimum wage over several years could be one way forward, increasing it incrementally each year by one pound. However, the majority of participants still felt that an immediate rise in the minimum wage was necessary, in order to protect the most vulnerable in our society from poverty.

The majority of participants also thought that it was necessary to encourage people to return to or stay in work. However, one participant thought that increasing the minimum wage to £15 per hour would not solve our problems, it would only increase inflation. However, all participants agreed that the least well-off people in society need a helping hand to lead a dignified life, in a way that can encourage their return to or stay in work and so raise the nation's well-being in the future. To avoid stoking inflation unnecessarily, the group favoured raising the minimum wage gradually. However, everyone agreed that, even if inflation temporarily increased slightly as a consequence, it should be considered a necessary sacrifice in order to achieve the laudable end of lifting society’s poorest people out of food poverty and, one day, poverty altogether.

The majority of participants thought that it was necessary to help the most vulnerable to cope with rising energy costs and to stop food poverty. The majority of participants also thought that it was necessary to encourage people to return to or stay in work. However, one participant thought that increasing the minimum wage to £15 per hour would not solve our problems, it would only increase inflation. This view was not shared by the other participants. We had a robust debate in relation to inflation and increased consumer spending. Most agreed that with wages remaining stagnant since 2008 coupled with year on year inflation over 3% there had been an unconsciously effective wage squeeze resulting in economic under performance. Increasing wages especially at the lower end is crucial to our economy's recovery and return to pre-crisis GDP levels.

Most participants thought that it was necessary to help the most vulnerable to cope with rising energy costs and to stop food poverty. The majority of participants also thought that it was necessary to encourage people to return to or stay in work. However, some participants thought that increasing the minimum wage to £15 per hour would not solve our problems, it would only increase inflation. In response, it was agreed that the minimum wage should be increased to £15 per hour but the rate of increase would be in stages so that it wouldn't contribute to inflation. Also, increasing the minimum wage could contribute towards creating more equal living standards in the UK, but other actions may need to be taken, such as implementing public services to ensure that there is equal access for everyone and social mobility.
