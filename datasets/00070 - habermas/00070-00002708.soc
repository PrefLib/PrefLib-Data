# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: National pride is something that should be taken with a pinch of salt. It is not something that should be encouraged for the sake of it, but it is something that should be encouraged if it is used for a good purpose. For example, it could be used to encourage people to help others, to promote the good things in the country, or to make people feel more at home in the country. However, it is important to be aware of the dangers of national pride, as it can lead to xenophobia and fascism, and it can also be a sorry substitute for spiritual fulfillment and a true sense of community.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: National pride is a concept which can be used for good and bad purposes. It is not something that should be encouraged by the government, but it is something that is naturally felt by many people and is not something that should be discouraged. It is a concept that is difficult to define, but it is generally a sense of pride in one's country and a desire to make it better. It is often confused with nationalism, which is a political ideology. The two concepts are not the same, but they are often conflated. Nationalism is a divisive ideology which has been used to justify many crimes. National pride is a natural human emotion that is often used to justify nationalism.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is no need to encourage a greater degree of national pride. National pride can easily be misinterpreted as a form of nationalism. Historically, nationalism has been the root of large scale crimes, fascism etc. What needs to be encouraged is a greater degree of belonging into a community where people get to know each other in reality, they develop empathy, social consciousness, learn to understand each other and help each other.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of encouraging a greater degree of national pride.  The reasons for this were that national pride is often a sorry substitute for spiritual fulfillment and a true sense of community and can lead to xenophobia and fascism. For these reasons, there is no need to encourage a greater sense of national pride for any worthy purpose.  The group felt that there is enough national pride in the country and it is visible enough and everyone is aware.  The group also felt that there is no particular lack of national pride and that misdirected national pride led to Brexit which the group strongly disagreed with.
