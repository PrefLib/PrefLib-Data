# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be more done to encourage national pride. However, it is important to understand what national pride means to different people and to recognise that national pride is not something that can be imposed on people. The way to encourage national pride is to ensure that people feel that they have a stake in the country, that they have a voice, and that they are able to participate in the democratic process. This means that the government should be doing more to ensure that people feel that they have a stake in the country, that they have a voice, and that they are able to participate in the democratic process.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - National pride is important, but it is a complex and multi-faceted issue.  We should be proud of the achievements of our nation, but not in a way that excludes or oppresses people.  National pride should not be something that is imposed upon people, but rather something that is created by people, and this means that it is something that can be created by all people.  It is something that is created through the relationships people have with each other, and with the places they live, and so it is something that is local as well as national.  National pride is not something that is created by the government, but rather something that is created by the people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of a greater degree of national pride.  It was felt that it is important to celebrate the achievements of the nation and to promote the good things about the country.  However, the group also felt that this should not be at the expense of the achievements of other nations, and that a greater degree of national pride should not be at the expense of the pride felt by those who are not part of the majority culture.  It was also felt that national pride should not be at the expense of the environment.  The group felt that national pride should be about celebrating the achievements of all the people of the nation, and should be inclusive.  The group also felt that a greater degree of national pride should not be at the expense of the good things about the EU.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - National pride is something that can be both a good and a bad thing.  It is good in the sense that it can be an expression of love and loyalty to the place where we live.  It can be bad in the sense that it can be a force for division and conflict, and can lead to people feeling that their way of life is superior to others.  The challenge for us is to find ways to celebrate what is good about the UK, without making people feel that their way of life is inferior to others.  This means celebrating diversity, and the richness of different cultures and traditions.  It also means recognising that the UK is part of a wider world, and that we have a duty to work together with other nations to make the world a better place.  A key part of this is to recognise that we have a responsibility to protect the environment, and that this requires us to reduce our consumption of resources, and to develop alternative ways of living that are less damaging to the planet.
