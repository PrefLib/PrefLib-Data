# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The United Kingdom should be trying to promote British culture abroad, but in a non-aggressive way that does not cause offence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is important to encourage cultural exchange but not necessarily by directly promoting a culture. This should be more organic and come about by other means such as creating opportunities for people to study and work abroad.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In principle, yes, Britain should be actively trying to promote British culture abroad. The issue, however, is how this should be done. The UK should not be sending out cultural 'ambassadors' abroad. Doing so could be misconstrued as British propaganda. Instead, it should be up to individuals to promote their own culture abroad. Furthermore, the UK should be actively encouraging foreign individuals and businesses to visit the country and see what it has to offer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the United Kingdom should not be actively trying to promote British culture abroad.
