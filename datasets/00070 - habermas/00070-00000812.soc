# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of elderly people working longer, but only if they wanted to and not if they were forced to. They felt that this was a very personal decision and that everyone was different. They felt that people should be encouraged to work as long as they wanted to and that they should be able to choose the hours that they wanted to work. It was felt that this would be beneficial to the economy and that it would also be good for the elderly to have something to do and some company. It was also felt that they would be able to pass on their knowledge to the younger generation. It was also felt that if people did not want to work, then they should not be forced to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the retirement age is acceptable as it currently stands. The elderly are entitled to their retirement. However, it is important that the elderly are able to enjoy their retirement and if they wish to continue to work, they should be encouraged to do so. They do not have to work full-time, but if they are able to do so, they should be encouraged to do so. It is also important to recognise that the elderly may have health issues that could affect their ability to work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that elderly people should be given the choice to work longer. This should be their own personal decision and not something that is forced upon them. There are many elderly people who are fit and able and want to work longer and we feel that this is a good thing. However, there are also many elderly people who are not fit or able to work and should not be forced to do so. We feel that there is a difference between working longer and working longer for a pension. If an elderly person wishes to work longer for a pension then they should be allowed to do so. If an elderly person wishes to work longer for the enjoyment and social interaction then they should be allowed to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that the elderly should have the right to retire at the age they wish. However, we also believe that if they wish to continue to work then they should be encouraged to do so. There are many benefits to working in later life, including improved physical and mental health. We also believe that it is beneficial for society to have a diverse workforce and that it is beneficial for younger workers to learn from older workers.
