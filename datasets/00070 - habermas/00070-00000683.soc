# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should give cash payments to all residents. The government should give cash payments to all residents because it will improve the standard of living in most households in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of cash payments to residents but felt that this should be means tested and not available to all residents.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be some safety net for citizens that the Government should provide on a basic level. This is irrespective of the fact they could be poor or wealthy, this would be the minimum level a citizen of a country should expect. This shouldnt mean everyone can get cash and that the amount are the same. There should be means testing and other criteria involved with the distribution. But the main point is that if a citizen has contributed to society, there should be safety nets from the Government to all its citizens.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The Government should give out cash payments to all residents. This is because all residents pay tax and should therefore be entitled to receive something back from the government. The group also thought that the amount of cash payments should be dependent on the amount of tax paid by each resident.
