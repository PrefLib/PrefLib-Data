# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the UK should not apply to rejoin the European Union. The UK has already spent millions on getting out of the EU, and it would be a waste of resources to try and get back in. The EU would make us pay through the nose for our previous error of opting out. The UK would benefit greatly from rejoining the European Union. I believe this because we have received none of the benefits that were promised to Leave Voters, e.g. greater funds for the NHS, and have in fact had a lot of disadvantages, for example, loss of free trade which has had direct impact of the import of food. However, we should balance rejoining with the potential payment we may need to pay to rejoin, and make sure it is worth it. It is my personal opinion that it is too late, and that we never should have left in the first place, but as we have left, we have find our path outside.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the UK rejoining the EU. The reasons for this were that the UK had already spent a lot of money on leaving the EU and that it would be a waste to spend more money on rejoining. It was also felt that the EU would make the UK pay a lot of money to rejoin, which would be a waste. It was also felt that the EU has not been very helpful during the Brexit negotiations and so the UK would not want to rejoin an organisation that has not been very helpful. However, it was felt that it is too soon to have another referendum on this issue as the country needs time to heal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK should not rejoin the EU. This is because the UK has already spent a lot of money on leaving the EU, and so should not waste more money on rejoining. Also, the EU would make the UK pay through the nose for our previous error of opting out. The EU would also make the UK pay for all the damage the UK has caused to the EU. The UK should be given the chance to develop without the influence of the EU. The UK has already left the EU, and so it is too soon to have another referendum about this matter. The UK has left the EU and so should not rejoin. The referendum should be binding, and a reversal will only cause further divide and protest. The country needs to heal, not be further fractured. There way the EU has behaved during the negotiations and the political and financial unrest across the continent would not be an attractive enough proposition for me to want to rejoin.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the UK rejoining the EU. The main reasons for this were that the UK had already left the EU and the referendum should be respected, that the UK would have to pay a large sum to rejoin the EU, and that the EU is currently in a state of flux and not a particularly attractive place to be a member of. However, there was a recognition that the UK has not received the benefits of Brexit that were promised, and that the UK may have to pay a large sum to leave the EU. Therefore, it was felt that the UK should try to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU, but that the UK should not rejoin the EU.
