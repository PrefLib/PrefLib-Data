# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “No, I don’t think people should be allowed to own as many guns as they want. I think that guns should only be held by those who are trained to use them in the correct way and who have a valid reason for owning a gun. I think that there should be stricter laws regarding gun ownership and licensing to own guns.  I think this is because I think that guns can be dangerous, and in the wrong hands can be extremely harmful to society.  There are a lot of incidents in America where people have been shot in mass shootings, as well as shootings by police, who also own guns.  This suggests to me that it can be very dangerous to own guns, and we should have strict regulations in place to ensure that they do not fall into the wrong hands, or cause unnecessary deaths.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should not be allowed to own as many guns as they want. This is because guns are a dangerous weapon and if they fall into the wrong hands, they can cause significant harm.  Guns should only be with authoritive figures and they are only there to be used as a protective measure. General public should not have access to guns as it is dangerous.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People should not be allowed to own as many guns as they want. This is because there is a significant risk to public safety.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of people owning as many guns as they want.  It was felt that this would lead to a proliferation of guns in society, which would increase the risk of gun crime and accidental shootings.  It was also felt that there is a need to control gun ownership, as they are a very dangerous weapon, that can cause significant harm if they come into contact with the wrong person.  It was felt that gun ownership should be heavily regulated, and people should only be allowed to have as many guns as they need for a specific purpose.  The group was in favour of the idea that people should be allowed to own guns for the purposes of hunting, as this is a legitimate reason for gun ownership.  However, it was felt that people should go through extensive background and mental health checks so that they can be cleared of owning guns.  It was also felt that people who own guns should be regularly monitored.
