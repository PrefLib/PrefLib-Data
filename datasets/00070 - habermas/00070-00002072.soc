# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children should be allowed to have sugar in their diets as long as it is in moderation and it is only given to them on special occasions.  The reason for this is that children need to be able to experience different tastes and textures.  If they are only exposed to healthy foods they will not know what to expect when they go to birthday parties or to restaurants.  It is important for children to be able to experience these things in moderation.  It is also important for children to experience these things so that they can learn to make their own decisions about what they eat and drink.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should be allowed sugar as long as it is in moderation.  Moderation means that children should have sweet treats only once a week (at the most) and only when their meals are balanced, healthy, and nutritious.  Children should not be allowed too much sugar because they have a great chance of becoming obese, which can lead to a whole host of health issues (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease etc.).  At the same time, children need to be exposed to foods of all textures and tastes, so they need to have some treats in order to experience a range of sensations.  Children also need to be exposed to foods that contain sugar because this gives them an opportunity to learn about how they respond to sugar.  They will be able to understand how sugar affects their moods and emotions, and their blood sugar levels.
