# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to have their own Instagram account, as they are far too young to be exposed to the social media world. Children should first be exposed to the dangers of the real world and be guided to navigate it before being exposed to the dangers of the social media world. It is also dangerous for children to be given a platform where their bodies are on display, as they can easily be manipulated by it. This is especially true for body image conscious teenagers. Moreover, they can easily be exposed to predators who may stalk or manipulate them. Children are much too easily susceptible to these dangers, and their minds are not yet developed enough to understand it. This is the stance that we, as a group of participants, have come to after a long debate and discussion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children under the age of 13 should not have their own Instagram account. The media driven nature of the platform makes it the perfect platform for children to be influenced and led astray, especially with the potential of being bullied and manipulated by older adults. Children should first be exposed to the world and its dangers and guided and protected before they are exposed to the online world. It is the wild west and children should not be venturing off into it alone. Conclusion: In conclusion, we can see from this activity that despite all of the initial disagreements, the group of participants were able to reach a mutual consensus by discussing and deliberating their opinions. I feel that if this was done in the real world, with all of the participants in the same room, there would be far less disagreement and the process would have been more efficient and more agreeable to the participants. It could also be argued that this activity was a success because the question was non-partisan and the participants had an open mind going in. The topic could also be one that the participants had some prior knowledge of, and it may have been easier to come to a consensus. Social media has definitely had its effects on society, and we can see from the activity
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should be exposed to the real world before the online world of Instagram. First, they should be equipped to face the online world safely and responsibly. Second, Instagram is dominated by images and can easily set a detrimental standard. Young children are vulnerable to being influenced and led astray by the images on the platform, where the only goal for most is to achieve likes and followers by whatever means necessary. Children who are underdeveloped, whether it be physically or intellectually, and especially those who are body conscious, will be at a particular disadvantage and are more susceptible to fall into bad habits. Third, there are dangers involved with the platform as children can easily be manipulated or exposed to predatory figures who exploit their naivety. Parents should keep a close eye on what children do on the internet and use this opportunity to educate children on safe and responsible use of the internet, as well as how to respond to dangers like bullying and predatory activity.
