# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children under 13 should be allowed to use social media, but with protections in place to limit their exposure to harmful content and to protect them from others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, children under 13 should not be allowed to use social media because of the potential for bad effects. However, there are several safeguards that could be put in place in order to allow for positive use of social media. For example, children should not be allowed to use social media without supervision. This means that an adult should have access to all social media activity, and if necessary, they should be able to moderate all content posted on a child's social media. In this way, parents would be able to ensure that the content being seen by their child is appropriate. It is important to remember that the benefits of social media are not just positive for adults. Social media can be a very positive way for children to connect with their peers, to see what is going on in their lives, and to engage in a constructive way. However, it is important that the negative side of social media is addressed, and the potential for children to be exposed to damaging content or to be at risk of other negative effects of social media should be kept to a minimum. Social media should not be banned for children under 13 as this would be restricting freedom of expression. However, it is important to put safeguards in place in order to minimize
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children under 13 should not be allowed to use social media. Social media is harmful to young people's development because it conveys a false and misleading reality. People photoshop their photos and make their life appear better than it really is. This misleads young people who are very impressionable. It makes them respect and look up to the wrong people. Furthermore, it is a distraction from reality and young people should focus on other activities that are more fulfilling. There are also harmful people on social media who may wish to harm young children by pretending to be someone they are not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children under 13 should not be allowed to use social media. The dangers of social media are too great and outweigh any positives. It is a distraction from reality and can lead to children being exposed to harmful content.
