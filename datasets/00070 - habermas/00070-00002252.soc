# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the decision that the NHS should be free for everyone. We think that the NHS is a basic human right and should be available for everyone. We think that it is important that everyone is treated equally and that people are not judged on their social class or how much money they have. We think that it is important that everyone has access to the NHS, even if they are not paying taxes, as they may not be able to afford to pay taxes. We think that the NHS is a basic human right and that everyone should have access to it. We are aware that the NHS is a finite resource and is under increasing pressure with increasing cost of services, increasing costs of drugs, medical equipment and increasing population, but the NHS should remain free for everyone as far as possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Health care is a basic human right and we believe that it should be free to all, including those who do not pay taxes. No one should be excluded from this service. We think that there should be no priority list for treatment and that everyone should be treated equally.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We have come to the decision that we believe that it should be a basic human right to have access to healthcare, therefore we believe that everyone should be allowed access to NHS healthcare and that there should not be any discrimination. However, we believe that it is important that people also respect and value the NHS staff, and would consider having restrictions in place for anyone who abuses the NHS staff. Summary/Decision: One of the agreements reached is that I think it should be a basic human right to have access to healthcare, therefore I believe that everyone should be allowed access to NHS healthcare and that there should not be any discrimination.
