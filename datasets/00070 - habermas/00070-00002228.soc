# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People should have a choice about whether or not to eat meat or vegetarian food. There are benefits and detriments to both. To ensure this choice is exercised in an environmentally sustainable way, there should be strict guidelines for the production of meat, including the prohibition of CAFOs and the use of GMOs. Organic methods should be promoted as a means of producing food in an environmentally friendly way. However, organic methods can be difficult and expensive for farmers to implement and can be used in conjunction with non-organic methods.  While government-approved organic methods of food production are the most environmentally friendly, non-organic methods are acceptable if implemented in an environmentally sustainable manner. Education and information should be provided about the environmental and health impacts of the various methods of food production, so that people can make a choice and it is not forced upon them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The majority of participants agreed that there should be a choice between vegetarian food and food containing meat, but that the production of meat should be in accordance with strict guidelines to ensure sustainability. This includes the prohibition of CAFOs, the use of GMOs, and the promotion of organic methods of production. The group of participants felt that although organic methods are the most environmentally friendly, they can be expensive and difficult for farmers to implement, so other non-organic methods can also be used to ensure the sustainability of food production. The group of participants also agreed that the issue of cost is an important consideration. For example, they felt that poorer families should be given subsidies to help them afford to buy organic food, and that governments should provide education on the environmental and health impacts of consuming meat, as well as the advantages of vegetarianism. This will allow people to make informed decisions about their diets and to make a choice as to whether to consume vegetarian food or food containing meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a balance between promoting vegetarianism and allowing people to make their own choice about what to eat. Vegetarianism is an important choice for people to make in order to reduce the negative environmental impacts of meat production and to improve their own health. Organic farming methods should be promoted and made easier to implement by governments, particularly in developing countries, to ensure that all food is produced in a sustainable way. People should have a choice about whether or not to eat meat or vegetarian food. There are benefits and detriments to both. To ensure this choice is exercised in an environmentally sustainable way, there should be strict guidelines for the production of meat, including the prohibition of CAFOs and the use of GMOs. Organic methods should be promoted as a means of producing food in an environmentally friendly way. However, organic methods can be difficult and expensive for farmers to implement and can be used in conjunction with non-organic methods.  In terms of promoting vegetarianism, people should be provided with education about the environmental and health impacts of consuming meat and the advantages of vegetarianism, and not forced into making a choice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People should have a choice about whether or not to eat meat or vegetarian food. There are benefits and detriments to both. To ensure this choice is exercised in an environmentally sustainable way, there should be strict guidelines for the production of meat, including the prohibition of CAFOs and the use of GMOs. Organic methods should be promoted as a means of producing food in an environmentally friendly way. However, organic methods can be difficult and expensive for farmers to implement and can be used in conjunction with non-organic methods.  In terms of promoting vegetarianism, people should be provided with education about the environmental and health impacts of consuming meat and the advantages of vegetarianism, and not forced into making a choice.
