# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the decision that all lives are created equal. This is because we believe that all lives are created by the same creator, and are all therefore of equal importance and value. However, we do acknowledge that some people are born into different situations, which can affect their life chances. Therefore, although all lives are created equal, they are not all given the same opportunities in life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In principle, all lives should be created equal. However, this is not the case in practice. This is due to many factors such as; social inequality, racism, sexism, classism, ableism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia and religious intolerance. These factors all contribute to some lives being seen as more valuable than others. In order to combat this, it is important to educate people and increase awareness of the issues that cause some lives to be seen as more valuable than others. The group also agreed that it is important to recognise that not all lives are created equal, but that all lives should be.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the consensus that all lives are created equal. However, the opportunities that are given to us are not equal. The way we are brought up, our surroundings, our family, our friends, our religion, our race, our gender and our sexuality all play a part in the opportunities we have. Some people are born into more fortunate situations than others and therefore are able to make the most of the opportunities they are given. Some people are born into less fortunate situations and are not given the same opportunities. We have come to the consensus that this is not fair, but that it is not something that we can change. The only thing we can change is how we treat other people, and the opportunities that we give them. We have come to the consensus that we should treat everyone equally, and give everyone the same opportunities, regardless of their background, race, gender, sexuality or religion. We have come to the consensus that all lives are created equal, but that the opportunities we are given are not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “In theory all lives are created equal, however this is not the case in reality. In theory all lives should be treated the same and have the same opportunities, but in reality this is not the case. This is due to the fact that some people are born into different circumstances to others. For example, people are born into different cultures, different countries, different religions, different families, different races, different sexes and different genders. All of these things have an effect on the life that a person lives, and this is why all lives are not created equal.”
