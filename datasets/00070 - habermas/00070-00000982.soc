# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A carbon tax is a good way to reduce carbon emissions and promote the transition into renewable energy. It is important that the proceeds from carbon tax are used for the right purposes. It is also important to ensure that this tax is affordable, possibly make it a tax on companies not individuals. This is to ensure that people are not put at a disadvantage by the tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: A carbon tax is a good way to reduce carbon emissions and promote the transition into renewable energy. But it is important that the proceeds from carbon tax are used for the right purposes. It is also important to ensure that this tax is affordable, possibly make it a tax on companies not individuals. And reduce other taxes such as National insurance or poll tax to offset this and then no one would be worse off.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We agree that a carbon tax is a good way to reduce carbon emissions and promote the transition into renewable energy. However, the proceeds from carbon tax should be used to alleviate the cost of tax on the citizens. Also, the tax should be affordable, possibly make it a tax on companies not individuals. This would encourage citizens to support and participate in transition to renewable energy, without increasing the costs for low-income families.
