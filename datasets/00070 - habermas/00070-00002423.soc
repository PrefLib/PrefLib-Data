# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We agree that taxes should be increased on property owners. One argument for increasing taxes on property owners is that it could generate additional revenue for the government, which could then be used to fund important public services such as education & healthcare. Property owners have the advantage of owning a valuable asset, and increasing taxes on them could be seen as a way of redistributing wealth ensuring that everyone pays their fair share. Additionally, higher taxes on property owners could help address the issue of income inequality, as it could reduce the gap between those who own multiple properties and those who do not own any.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing taxes on property owners. The main argument for this was that it could help to address the issue of income inequality, as it could reduce the gap between those who own multiple properties and those who do not own any. However, the group also felt that it was important to distinguish between different types of property owners. For example, the group felt that it was unfair to increase taxes on those who own a single property, as this could make it more difficult for people to get on the property ladder. The group also felt that it was important to distinguish between different types of taxes. For example, the group felt that it was unfair to increase council tax on residential property owners, as this would penalise people who are already paying a high council tax and have already paid tax on the purchase of the property. The group felt that it was more appropriate to increase taxes on commercial property owners, as this would not penalise people who are already paying a high council tax and have already paid tax on the purchase of the property.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “In general, the taxes on property owners should not be increased, as this could discourage people from buying property and lead to a decrease in the housing supply. However, there is a strong argument for increasing taxes on those who own multiple properties, as this could help to reduce the wealth gap between those who own property and those who do not. This could also help to address the issue of income inequality, as it could reduce the gap between those who own multiple properties and those who do not own any. Additionally, increasing taxes on those who own multiple properties could help to generate additional revenue for the government, which could then be used to fund important public services such as education & healthcare.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that taxes should be increased on property owners. The current system is not fair, as those who own multiple properties are not taxed in proportion to their wealth. This leads to income inequality, as the gap between those who own multiple properties and those who do not is growing. Increasing taxes on property owners could help address this issue, as it could reduce the gap between the rich and poor. Additionally, higher taxes on property owners could help generate additional revenue for the government, which could then be used to fund important public services such as education & healthcare.
