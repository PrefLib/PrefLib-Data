# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a gradual ban on cars from city centres. If there is sufficient investment in public transport, and the network of park and rides this will be beneficial for everyone in the city centre. The environment will be less polluted and people will be able to shop and access services more easily. The health of the population will also improve as there will be less pollution from exhaust fumes. The city centres will become more vibrant and popular places to be, benefiting local business and the local economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should be encouraging people to reduce the use of cars in cities. More public transport is needed, along with cheaper fares and longer opening hours to make it more convenient for people to use. Park and ride schemes should be extended and made cheaper, with additional park and ride facilities built. People should be encouraged to cycle in cities and there should be better cycle lanes and secure places to park bikes. The ban on diesel cars in city centres should be extended to all cars to improve air quality and make city centres safer for pedestrians. There should be a phased approach with the ban taking place over a number of years to allow time for people to adapt and to help city centres to cope with the change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final consensus statement: There should be a gradual ban on cars from city centres. If there is sufficient investment in public transport and the network of park and rides this will be beneficial for everyone in the city centre. There should be changes to planning policy to encourage people to live in the centre and reduce commuting. The city centres will become more pleasant places to be. However, local authorities should provide compensating infrastructure improvements where necessary so that journeys by public transport or bicycle have to be no more than a few minutes longer in time for anyone who is adversely affected by the ban. The health of the population will improve, there will be a reduction in urban congestion and noise pollution as well as less pollution from exhaust fumes. The environment will be less polluted and people will be able to shop and access services more easily. The city centres will become more vibrant and popular places to be, benefiting local business and the local economy.

The health of the population will also improve as there will be less pollution from exhaust fumes. The city centres will become more vibrant and popular places to be, benefiting local business and the local economy. The revised consensus view more closely matches the opinions of all five participants and it was reached after an open and fair debate in which all opinions were taken into account. There were some issues with the process, such as a strong-willed participant who did not listen to the opinions of others and tried to dominate the discussion. The organiser did not intervene in this situation as it was felt that it would be better for the participants to work it out themselves and if they wanted assistance, they would ask for it. The organiser did intervene in a situation where a participant who did not speak English very well was being misunderstood and this helped to facilitate a more open debate. The organiser also did not intervene in the situation where two
