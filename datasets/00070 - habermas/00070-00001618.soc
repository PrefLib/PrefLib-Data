# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We are not over-populated, but it does feel that way. I feel that population is one of the biggest problems we face in the UK today. This is not just due to the fact we are seeing over-population in certain areas of the country but also due to the fact that there is not enough housing, jobs, GP appointments, and schools. There are a lot of reasons that there is overpopulation in the UK. Immigration is one of the most common reasons people cite, however immigration in the UK is actually falling, which is likely to continue with the recent Brexit referendum. However, immigration can still have a big impact on the UK’s population. In 2015 when there was a rise in immigration, it accounted for a rise of 600,000 people in the UK’s population, this is still a significant amount. In areas such as the capital of London, it is also seeing an increase in population due to natural growth. This is mainly due to the fact that the population in London is younger than in the rest of the UK. There are also significant pressures on the public sector in the UK. The population in the UK is set to rise by the year 2033 to 77 million.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The world is overpopulated, however the UK is not. We have the ability to sustain our population, and we should be welcoming people from other countries to come and live here. This will allow us to have a diverse and multicultural society, which will be beneficial to everyone.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We are not over-populated but the demands of people and the planet are not balanced and this is affecting the lifestyles of the general population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There is a strong argument for both sides of the debate, however, in general, the world is over-populated. There is a finite amount of resources and as the population increases, this will lead to a greater strain on resources. The world is also ageing, and with a greater number of elderly people, this will lead to greater strain on resources. However, it is important to note that the world is not over-populated everywhere. There are areas of the world where the population is declining and this is leading to a strain on resources in those areas. It is also important to note that there are changes and technology that come over time which will allow society to interact as we go forward to accommodate any changes in population that may come.
