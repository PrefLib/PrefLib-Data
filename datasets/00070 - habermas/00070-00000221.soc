# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a strong argument for making cannabis legal. The financial benefits of this would be enormous. Taxing cannabis would provide the government with more money for public services. Also the lower crime rate that would result from legalisation would mean less money needed for the police force. By legalising cannabis it would also be more regulated and the quality of the drug would improve. People would be better educated on what they were smoking. If we were able to regulate the drug properly, there would be little risk of the drug becoming a danger to people's health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, legalising marijuana is the way forward. By taxing it we can put money back into the economy. This would be used to improve our schools and public works, which in turn would mean we have better skilled workers for the future. The crime rate would be reduced, and this would mean we have less money to spend on the police. It would also be more regulated so people will have a better idea of what they're smoking. The only concern would be with it's recreational use, and that is where the dangers can be found. If people are aware of what they're smoking, and what it can do to them, then we will be able to better regulate this drug and prevent the effects of it being so detrimental.
