# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We don't believe that companies should be able to have a zero-tolerance policy on the use of social media by their employees. We don't think it is an employers place to dictate how a person should spend their time outside of work. If an employee was sharing inappropriate content or posting disparaging remarks about their employer on social media, that would be cause for concern and likely to be dealt with under a companies normal disciplinary procedures. However, if an employee is abiding by the law and is not disparaging their employer on social media, they should be allowed to use it as they wish outside of work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Companies should be allowed to have a zero-tolerance policy on the use of social media by their employees. However, employees should be allowed to use their social media as they wish outside of work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to a blanket ban on social media usage by employees.  The group felt that social media usage by employees was something that needed to be managed and that there were appropriate uses for social media.  The group felt that social media usage could be appropriate to help build a company's brand and to build relationships with customers.  The group felt that the use of social media by employees should be carefully managed and that there should be guidelines on what was appropriate.  The group felt that the use of social media by employees should not be a sackable offence unless it was used inappropriately or in a way that was detrimental to the company.
