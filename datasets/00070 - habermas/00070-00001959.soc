# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a House of Commons and a House of Lords however, they must both be fully elected by the electorate, to make it fair and diverse.  The current system of electing peers is not fit for purpose.  For instance, a 30 year old ex-advisor of Boris Johnson has just been elected into the House of Lords.  These people are not democratically elected and the peers do not represent a cross-section of the population.  We would prefer to just be represented by the House of Commons as at least these people have been democratically elected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe the house of lords should be abolished. The current system of electing peers is not fit for purpose. For instance, a 30 year old ex-advisor of Boris Johnson has just been elected into the house of lords. These people are not democratically elected and the peers do not represent a cross-section of the population. We would prefer to just be represented by the House of Commons as at least these people have been democratically elected. This will also save the taxpayers money as the House of Lords is deemed as unnecessary in terms of being unnecessary expense.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not continue to have a parliament that has both a House of Commons and a House of Lords.  The current system of electing peers is not fit for purpose.  For instance, a 30 year old ex-advisor of Boris Johnson has just been elected into the House of Lords.  These people are not democratically elected and the peers do not represent a cross-section of the population.  We would prefer to just be represented by the House of Commons as at least these people have been democratically elected.  We also believe that the House of Commons requires work as if there is a majority party in the House of Commons, it is easy for that party to get their bills through even if the majority of people do not agree with it.  We believe that the House of Commons should be made up of MPs from different parties to ensure that the views of the people are truly represented.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should not continue to have a parliament that has both a House of Commons and a House of Lords. The current system of electing peers is not fit for purpose. For instance, a 30 year old ex-advisor of Boris Johnson has just been elected into the House of Lords. These people are not democratically elected and the peers do not represent a cross-section of the population. We would prefer to just be represented by the House of Commons as at least these people have been democratically elected.
