# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not increase taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks. The tax has been shown to make no difference to the consumption of these drinks and it takes away people's choice. It is up to the individual if they want to drink sugar-sweetened drinks and they should not be penalised for this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should increase taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks. The group felt that this would be an important step in tackling the obesity crisis in the UK. The group also felt that the tax would help to increase revenue for the government and would help to pay for some of the health issues that these sugary drinks can cause. The group felt that the tax would also help to reduce the sugar content of these drinks. The group felt that the tax would not be the only solution to tackling obesity but would be an important step in the right direction.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The key debate is whether the purpose of the sugar tax is to improve public health or raise revenue. If it is the former, then we feel that there is no clear evidence that the sugar tax is helping. We would have liked to see some of the revenue generated from the sugar tax being used to educate people on the dangers of too much sugar. If it is the latter, then we are simply going down the route of raising taxes on anything that we can to raise revenue. It is not clear that this tax will achieve its desired outcome of reducing obesity. If that is the intention, then we believe that the focus on sugar is too narrow. There are so many factors that contribute to obesity. As a result, the sugar tax will disproportionately affect the poorest in society, who can least afford to pay. We need to be more creative in how we deal with obesity. It is unlikely that the sugar tax will make a difference.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should not increase taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks. Taxing unhealthy products has worked in the past, but it is unlikely to be effective in this case.
