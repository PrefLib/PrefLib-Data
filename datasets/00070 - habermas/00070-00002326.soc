# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing autonomous cars on the road, but with some caveats.  The technology is there, and the level of testing that has been done is extensive, so it is only a matter of time before they are allowed on the road.  However, the group felt that the technology is not yet ready to be used by the general public, and that there should be a period of time where they are only used by a select few.  This will allow for any issues to be identified and resolved, and for the public to become more comfortable with the idea.  It was felt that the best way to introduce them would be to have them on the roads in a limited capacity, for example as taxis or delivery vehicles, where the driver can be in the vehicle to take control if anything were to go wrong.  This would allow for the technology to be tested in a real-world environment, but without putting the general public at risk.  The group also felt that the autonomous cars should be designed to take into account all weather conditions, to ensure that they are safe to use in all situations.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The majority of participants thought that the technology is not yet developed enough to be allowed on the road. However, the participants thought that it was only a matter of time before autonomous cars would be allowed on the road, as the technology is advancing at a rapid rate. The participants thought that it was a positive step towards making our roads safer, however there was a level of concern about the safety of the vehicles, and whether they would be able to react to the unexpected in the same way that a human driver would. The consensus view was that the technology is not yet ready for the roads, but it is only a matter of time.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing autonomous cars on the roads, but only after extensive testing to ensure safety.  The technology is there already, so it is only a matter of time before this happens anyway.  We must ensure it is a phased approach.  The level of technology has to develop significantly more before we consider autonomous cars for wider public use.  There are so many variables that come into play when a human evaluates how to drive safely, such as adverse weather or having to brake suddenly.  I don't think that machine learning is developed enough to allow autonomous cars yet, especially if there'd be a mix of human and computer drivers on any given road.  Maybe eventually, but not at the moment, unless there is a competent person in the driver's seat to act as a manual override if something in the autonomous car does go wrong.
