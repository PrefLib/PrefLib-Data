# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In time, computers will be able to think like humans to a large extent. The concept of thinking is very broad and can be interpreted in many different ways. Therefore, it is important to define what is meant by thinking, before making a statement about whether or not computers will be able to think like humans. Thinking is the process of using one's mind to consider or reason about something. Thinking can be a combination of ideas and feelings, and therefore, to think like a human, a computer would need to be able to process ideas and feelings. This can be done by teaching a computer to feel or emulate emotion to some degree. This is something that is currently being explored by research into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. As computers become more advanced, they will be able to process information and make decisions in a similar way to how humans do. This is something that is already happening in some industries, such as medicine, where computers are being used to make diagnoses, based on the information that is inputted into them. Therefore, we believe that in time, computers will be able to think like humans to a large extent.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In time, we will be able to make computers that think like humans. We already have developing AI systems that are incredibly human like and providing a huge insight in the times to come. As computers will be developed by humans this allows human input to be installed into them, and then software and machinery to be developed further on this basis. We will struggle to recreate human-like thinking in the emotional rollercoaster often witnessed in the human thought process. For example, we will surely not recreate the impact which fear creates in the human conscious. We surely therefore can not represent the role anger plays in making an action, and then subsequently regretting and trying to repent for said action. Computers may mathematically come close to thinking like humans but I do not believe that the twists and turns of human thought patterns can be recreated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We will struggle to recreate human-like thinking in the emotional rollercoaster often witnessed in the human thought process. For example, we will surely not recreate the impact which fear creates in the human conscious. We surely therefore can not represent the role anger plays in making an action, and then subsequently regretting and trying to repent for said action. Computers may mathematically come close to thinking like humans but I do not believe that the twists and turns of human thought patterns can be recreated. However, with the technology we currently have, and are likely to get in the near future, we will be able to develop a form of artificial intelligence that can think in a similar way to humans.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In time, we will be able to make computers that think like humans. We have already seen the development of computers that think like humans, but in the future we will be able to make computers that think like humans with a high degree of accuracy. In some cases, it may be difficult to distinguish between human thought and computer thought. There will however be some limits to the level of thinking computers will be able to mimic. For example, the twists and turns of human thought may be difficult to recreate. Computers will also not be able to feel, and therefore not able to feel emotions. Therefore, we will not recreate a computer that can think exactly like a human.
