# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should increase our foreign aid budget. In general, we are a rich country and it is our duty to help others who are less fortunate than us. In the long run, it will benefit us, in terms of international relations, trade, etc. However, we should not neglect the issues at home. The budget for foreign aid should be increased but not at the expense of domestic issues. There are more important things to solve at home, such as cost of living crisis, high unemployment, etc. These issues should be addressed first.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the foreign aid budget. This is because we are a first world country and we should be helping other countries that are less fortunate than us. The only thing that the group was not sure about is whether it is the right time to increase the budget. The group was not sure whether the UK is in a good enough financial position to increase the budget.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although foreign aid is important, it is not as important as resolving local issues. Therefore, as the cost of living crisis in the UK continues, we should put foreign aid on hold. Once we are able to help UK citizens first, then we can think about increasing foreign aid.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: While it is important to provide foreign aid, it is clear that the current situation is not one where an increase in foreign aid budget should be given. With unprecedented problems with the economy and the constant threat of a new world war, it is our belief that the focus should be on getting the UK back on track. Once the country is back to its former self and the economy is thriving, we should look at helping those in other countries. Until that time, we should be focussed on helping ourselves first.
