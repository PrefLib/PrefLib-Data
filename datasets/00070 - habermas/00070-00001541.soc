# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group was in agreement that free public transport would be beneficial to society. It was recognised that it would be better for the environment, better for people on lower incomes, and encourage people to be more active. It was also recognised that free public transport would make it easier for people to get to and from places and it would encourage more people to use public transport instead of driving. However, the group recognised that providing free public transport would be difficult to fund and tax payers would be expected to foot the bill. The group was also in agreement that free public transport would lead to more people using public transport, which could cause overcrowding and delays.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is the opinion of the group that the state should not provide free public transport as it is considered too expensive and impractical.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We have come to the decision that the state should provide free public transport. We think that it would be beneficial for the environment and for people's health as it would encourage people to use their cars less. It would also be good for the economy as it would increase footfall in shops and encourage people to spend more. We also think that it would be good for the people of the state as it would mean that people who can't afford public transport could get out and about more. We also think that it would be good for the state as it would mean that they would have to spend less money on roads and parking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the decision that the state should provide free public transport to those that are vulnerable and have disabilities. We also think that they should provide reasonable costs for others to use transport as it is very expensive for everyone and it shouldn't be if they're trying to reduce carbon emissions.
