# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a mandatory vote as everyone should be able to give their opinion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final Statement: I believe that a mandatory vote is an important step to improving the level of engagement within the population. In the modern age, it is becoming harder to reach people and convince them to vote. Therefore, I think that it is appropriate to implement this change. However, the measure would have to be introduced alongside a major change to voting procedures in order to be truly effective. I think that the biggest issue is voter ID. Many people cannot afford the £15 needed to obtain this, or the time off work that it takes to go to the relevant office and sign up. Therefore, a mandatory vote would be ineffective in improving engagement without some sort of change to make the process more accessible to all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should not be forced to vote, but there should be an incentive to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of a mandatory vote. The group felt that the vote is an important part of democracy, and that it is important that everyone has their say. However, the group also felt that the right not to vote as a form of protest is also important, and that it is unfair to punish those who cannot afford the time off work needed to vote. The group felt that it would be beneficial as a form of incentive as many citizens do not vote out of simple laziness or disengagement with politics, and a mandatory vote would solve this issue. The group also felt that a mandatory vote would increase engagement and allow for a more accurate election result.
