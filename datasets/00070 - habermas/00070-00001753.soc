# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is a need for more police officers, but the way in which the police are trained and deployed needs to be reviewed. There is a need for more police officers on the streets, but they need to be trained in a way that allows them to build relationships with the local community, and they need to be deployed in a way that allows them to get to know their local community. There is also a need for more specialist police officers to deal with cyber crime, and to deal with the rise in mental health issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We need more police officers. The police are in crisis. There are not enough of them and they are under too much stress.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We need more police officers. We also need to look at how police are trained. We feel that if police were trained to de-escalate situations, and to be more understanding, then we would not need as many police officers. We also feel that if we had more police officers, then there would be less need for armed police. We also feel that if we had more police officers, then there would be less need for armed police.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It was agreed that the country definitely needs more police officers. There has been a significant decrease in police numbers since 2010, which has been further compounded by the fact that a lot of police officers are now needed to carry out tasks such as traffic control and patrolling beaches as opposed to fighting crime. This means that there is an increasing need for more police officers who can be used to fight crime. Whilst crime rates have fallen over the past 30 years, there has been a sharp rise in the past decade. Police numbers have also fallen significantly. Having more police officers will mean that each individual officer will be under less stress. This will improve their mental health and reduce the risk of an officer committing suicide. The current staffing levels are putting significant strain on the police force and this needs to be addressed.
