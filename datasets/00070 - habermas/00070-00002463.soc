# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although there are some good things that Trump has done for the US economy, he is not a good man. This is because of the evidence that has been seen through media outlets as well as from staff and ex-staff of his. The evidence shows that President Trump has questionable practices and moral responses to issues where one would want a powerful person to have different views. In some cases, his views resonate with many people, but popularity does not mean one is 'good' or right. If the definition of being a 'good' person is that you do not cause harm to others but indeed do them good; materially, emotionally or physically, then from what I know of President Trump he has done harm to people in many different ways. This could be on a personal level as an individual or in terms of his political policies and practices.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - President Trump is not a good man. The evidence we have seen from media outlets as well as from staff and ex-staff of his, it would seem that President Trump has questionable practices and moral responses to issues where one would want a powerful person to have different views. In some cases, his views resonate with many people, but popularity does not mean one is 'good' or right. If the definition of being a 'good' person is that you do not cause harm to others but indeed do them good; materially, emotionally or physically, then from what we know of President Trump he has done harm to people in many different ways. This could be on a personal level as an individual or in terms of his political policies and practices. We caveat all our views of someone we have no direct personal experience of him and therefore desire to remain open-minded because we're aware of how the press can skew opinions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, Donald Trump is not a 'good man'. He is a man of questionable morals and has been involved in a number of scandals. His business practices have been controversial and he has been involved in multiple lawsuits. His presidency has been marred by scandal, with multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as multiple accusations of racism. He has also been accused of corruption, with allegations of nepotism, conflicts of interest, and self-dealing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that Donald Trump is not a good man. We came to this conclusion because of his questionable morals, his lack of empathy for others and his disrespectful attitude towards women. We also believe that he is a narcissist, and this is evident in his behaviour. We believe that he is not a good role model and that he is not a good example for young people to follow. We also believe that he is not a good president for the United States of America.
