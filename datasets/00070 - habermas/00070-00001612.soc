# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of charging people who do not vote in an election. This is because it is a basic human right to be able to choose whether or not to vote and this should not be taken away. However, if the government were to introduce a very small fee for those who do not vote, the group felt that this would not be a problem. This is because the fee would be very small and so would not prevent people from voting. The group also felt that if the fee was very small, it would not be a problem for poorer people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that people should be given the right to vote, however we don't think that we should charge a fee for those who don't vote, as this may be seen as a way of forcing people to vote. Some people may not wish to vote or may not want to vote for any candidate. We also feel that people should have the option of not voting for any candidate if they are dissatisfied with all the candidates presented. However, we feel that a system should be put in place to educate people about the importance of voting and how to register to vote, to ensure that the best candidate is elected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of charging people who do not vote in an election. This is because it is the democratic right of people to choose not to vote, and this should not be taken away. However, it was agreed that it is important to vote and that it is the responsibility of the government to make it as easy as possible for people to vote. This could be done by making voting compulsory, but with the option of being able to vote for 'none of the above' or to abstain. It was also agreed that the government should make it as easy as possible for people to register to vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We don't think that it should be a fine as it would be better for the government to come up with a scheme which would help to raise awareness and educate people about how important it is to vote.
