# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Smoking cigarettes should be made illegal. This will make smoking less accessible to the public, and more people will try to quit. This was a difficult topic for me to answer, but I think if it was made illegal, then people will not take it so lightly and start to understand the harmful effects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of a ban on cigarettes. We were all aware of the health implications and the effects it has on the people around you. The group thought that it would be a good idea to ban cigarettes and make it illegal to smoke. We all agreed that it would be a good idea to raise the age limit to stop young people smoking. We thought that this would be a good idea to stop the younger generation from smoking. We also thought that it would be a good idea to ban smoking in all indoor spaces and public transport. We thought that this would be a good idea as it would stop the harmful effects of second hand smoking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of a ban on cigarettes. This is because cigarettes are a health hazard and the ban would reduce the number of smokers and therefore the number of deaths caused by smoking. The group also felt that a ban would reduce the amount of litter caused by cigarettes and cigarette packets. However, the group felt that the ban would be difficult to enforce and would lead to an increase in the illegal sale of cigarettes. The group also felt that the ban would lead to an increase in the illegal production of cigarettes. The group felt that the ban would lead to an increase in the illegal production of cigarettes.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Smoking cigarettes should be made illegal. This will make smoking less accessible to the public and reduce the number of smokers, improving the health of our nation and reducing the NHS’s budget spent on treating smoking related diseases. It would reduce the effects of passive smoking on those around smokers and protect children who are currently being exposed to second hand smoke in their homes. This would reduce the amount of deaths caused by smoking related illnesses such as lung cancer. We also think that making smoking illegal would encourage people to quit, with support from the NHS, as it would be seen as a harder activity to take part in.
