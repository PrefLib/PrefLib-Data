It would also be a good way of enhancing an employees work life balance which would decrease the instances of sick leave through stress or other mental incapacities. It would be a great idea for office workers. However, people who work in customer services/retail etc cant just start working 4 days. It would mean employing more people which would be good for the people but small businesses cant afford to pay extra workers. Maybe if people want to work 4 days a week they should  look at job sharing or moving careers. Its unfair on people who work in industries that dont get the normal 9-5. people work nights, evenings, weekends, they cant just change their hours for that.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: A four day workweek would be a good idea for some professions but not all. The idea of a four day workweek is a good one, however, it would be difficult to implement in all professions. It would be beneficial to employees in terms of work life balance and increased happiness and health. However, it would be difficult to implement in professions where there is a high level of customer service required. It would also be difficult to implement in professions where the work is not office based and is not in an environment where the employee can easily control their workload.
