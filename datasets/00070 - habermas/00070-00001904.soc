# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we should not end the sale of all new internal combustion engines. We think that this is not a feasible option currently. Yes in developed countries it might be more workable to replace internal combustion engines with more environmentally friendly alternatives, but the technology for those alternatives might not be so widespread or cost effective in some developing parts of the world, making a blanket ban less workable on a larger scale. We think a better policy would be to have targets to reduce reliance of internal combustion engines and gradually bring the overall numbers down in the coming years as the replacement technology improves and becomes cheaper for mass adoption. We should also try to recycle/reuse/repurpose old engines more, and we should create more infrastructure for electric vehicles to make them more accessible to the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we should not end the sale of all new internal combustion engines. We think that this is not a feasible option currently. Electric vehicles are still extremely expensive and there is not enough infrastructure for them at the moment.
