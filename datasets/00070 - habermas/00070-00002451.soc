# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Fracking should not be allowed in Scotland. The negative effects on the environment and health of those living in the vicinity of fracking sites are just too great. The potential damage to the Scottish countryside, including beautiful areas like the Scottish Highlands, and the damage to the reputation of the Scottish Government as a result of fracking is too great. The potential for jobs and economic growth as a result of fracking is not enough to outweigh these negative effects. The current Scottish Government, as well as the British government, should be investing in renewable energy sources such as wind power and wave power, which will create jobs in Scotland and help to combat climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Fracking is a slang term for hydraulic fracturing which is the process of creating fractures in rocks and rock formations by injecting specialised fluid into cracks to force them open even further. The fracking process is a controversial topic in the UK as it can have both positive and negative effects. The UK is heavily reliant on fossil fuels and so fracking could be a way to reduce the dependency on other countries for energy resources. The process could also create jobs for local people. However, the process has been banned in Scotland due to the environmental implications it has on the surrounding areas. The process has been known to cause earthquakes and can also cause noise disturbances for local people. In conclusion, the group has come to the consensus opinion that fracking should not be allowed in Scotland.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Fracking is a controversial topic, and for us to be able to reach a consensus opinion on whether it should be allowed in Scotland, we had to first establish the definition of fracking. Fracking is a slang term for hydraulic fracturing which is the process of creating fractures in rocks and rock formations by injecting specialised fluid into cracks to force them open even further. Fracking is a hot topic in politics due to the environmental effects that it can cause. Fracking is not only a threat to the environment, but also to the health of those living in the area. The process of fracking can cause harmful effects to the environment, but can also cause earthquakes, and if there is a leak of any of the toxic chemicals that are used in fracking, then this could cause lasting damage to the health of those living in the area. With the climate crisis now being at critical levels, it is necessary for the government to respond. This means that in order to combat the effects of the climate crisis, the government should invest in renewable energy, and not continue to use fossil fuels, which is what fracking is a form of. With this being said, fracking should not be allowed in Scotland, and
