# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of a carbon footprint tax, but we felt that there were some things that would need to be considered. Firstly, we thought that there would need to be a threshold of carbon footprint before the tax would be applicable, because it would not be fair to penalise those who have no choice but to use a high carbon footprint. We also thought that the tax should be a replacement for other taxes, and not an additional one, because if it was additional it would not incentivise people to reduce their carbon footprint.  Conclusion: The group was in favour of a carbon footprint tax, but thought that there were some things that needed to be considered.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of taxing people based on their carbon footprint. However, they also believed that it would be unfair to implement this tax on people who were unable to change their behaviour due to lack of financial resources. They felt that this could be combatted by using the money collected through the tax to invest in sustainable energy and infrastructure projects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of a carbon footprint tax, but thought that the tax should be an additional tax, and not a replacement for existing taxes. This would be because if it were a replacement tax, it would be unfair to those who are unable to reduce their carbon footprint due to other circumstances. The group also thought that it should be a tax on individuals, not businesses, because it would be difficult to calculate the carbon footprint of a business. The group thought that it would be fairer to tax individuals on their carbon footprint, and then use the money to invest in renewable energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that those who have a high carbon footprint should be taxed on their carbon footprint. However, we do not think that this should be a tax that replaces all other taxes, but should be an additional tax that can be used to fund the development of cleaner technologies and to support poorer communities who are unable to reduce their carbon footprint.
