# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, while we all believe that it is beneficial for children to learn to code, we also believe that it is not an essential skill and should not be mandatory in schools. As such, while we do think that there should be more effort in schools to encourage students to take up coding, we do not think that there should be more pressure put on children to take it up.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although coding is a valuable skill to have and we should not discourage children from coding, we don't think it should be taught as a compulsory subject as this may deter those who may not wish to code. Children should be made aware of coding and the options it could provide them for the future, but shouldn't be forced to learn it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should be given the opportunity to learn to code.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of children learning to code but not as a compulsory part of their curriculum. It was felt that some children will have a natural inclination to learn this skill, and for them it would be very beneficial to pursue this interest. However, there will also be those who are not so keen and will prefer to learn other subjects, which will be more useful for their future careers.
