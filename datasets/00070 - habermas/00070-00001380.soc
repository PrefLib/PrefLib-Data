# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the notion of for-profit corporations running state schools is a dangerous one. Education is a right, not a commodity. The idea of profit being made from an education is an abhorrent one. The idea of for-profit corporations being allowed to run schools in general is an abhorrent one. If such corporations wish to invest in education, they should look at private schools.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that education is too important to be left to a for-profit corporation to manage. The well-being of children should be placed above profit and this cannot be guaranteed if a corporation runs schools. It would be far better for schools to be run by non-profit entities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that for-profit corporations should not be allowed to run state schools. Profit has no place in the education of children, as they should not be used to gain money from. Education is a fundamental right of children, and for-profit corporations will have to make money from it. They may also have the potential to provide sub-standard education for the children and young people in order to meet the profit target. They also pose a threat to teachers’ jobs, which should be protected. We believe that schools should remain in the hands of the government, specifically the Department for Education, and should be run by the civil service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: For-profit corporations should not be allowed to run state schools. The primary reason for this is that for-profit corporations are profit driven, and this will inevitably lead to a lowering of the quality of education for the children. For-profit corporations are also not subject to the same level of scrutiny as non-profit corporations, and this could lead to a lowering of the quality of education. The quality of education is the most important thing for the future of the country, and this should not be left in the hands of a for-profit corporation.
