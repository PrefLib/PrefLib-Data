# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections.  We felt that if people are living in the UK, paying taxes and making a contribution to society, they should have a say in how the country is run.  We felt that it was important to have a balance between allowing people to have a say in how the country is run and making sure that people who are not making a contribution to society are not allowed to vote.  We felt that the length of time that someone has been living in the UK is important.  We felt that people should be allowed to vote after living in the UK for a minimum of 3 years.  We felt that people should be allowed to vote in local elections providing that they are making a contribution to society.  We felt that this could be demonstrated by people being in employment, paying taxes and having no criminal record.  We felt that if people are making a contribution to society, they should be allowed to vote in local elections.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections. The group felt that it was important for non-UK citizens to have a say in their local community and that it would be beneficial for them to be able to do so. The group felt that there should be some restrictions on who is allowed to vote. For example, the group felt that non-UK citizens should have been resident in the UK for a certain amount of time before being allowed to vote. The group also felt that non-UK citizens should be working in the UK and making a contribution to society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is not a good idea to allow non-UK citizens to vote in local elections because only people who are fully integrated in society and who are willing to make the UK their permanent home should have the right to vote.  Many non-UK citizens are only in the UK to study, work, or for other temporary reasons, so it is unlikely they would be well-integrated in society.  They are also unlikely to have a long-term interest in their local area.  This is different to non-UK citizens who have dual nationality, in which case they are entitled to vote in UK elections.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group was divided on whether non UK citizens should be allowed to vote in local elections. However, the group all agreed that those who have been living and working in the UK for a number of years, and who have made an economic contribution to society, should be given the opportunity to vote. We also think it is important that this right to vote is only given to people who are likely to be staying in the UK for a considerable period of time. This could be confirmed by them having a visa that shows they will be living in the UK for more than 3 years, or they are an EU citizen who has registered to work in the UK.
