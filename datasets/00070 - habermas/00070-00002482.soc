# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a law that bans the sale of products that have been tested on animals. However, it is important to note that there are exceptions to this rule. For example, when testing new medicines, animals are sometimes the only option. It is also important to note that there are alternatives to animal testing. For example, the use of tissue cultures, computer models and clinical trials on human volunteers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that testing products on animals should be banned, as long as it does not compromise human safety. The issue of testing is a very complex one, and we understand that in some cases it is necessary. We feel that it is important to protect animals, but also to ensure that humans are not put in danger. We feel that it is important to use the most humane methods possible when testing on animals, and that it should be done in the most controlled way possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a law that bans the sale of products that have been tested on animals. However, this law should be flexible enough to allow for the testing of medicines on animals, as this is necessary to ensure that they are safe for human use. The law should also be flexible enough to allow for the testing of other products on animals, if there is no other way to test them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The safety of humans is paramount, but we should not abuse animals in the process. There should be a law that limits testing on animals, but not a complete ban. It is important that we continue to test on animals to ensure the safety of humans, but we should also continue to develop new ways to test on humans and in laboratories, so that we can reduce the number of animals that are tested on. The use of animals for testing should be reduced as much as possible, but not completely banned.”
