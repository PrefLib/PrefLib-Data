# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Yes, humans should be sent into space. The benefits of sending humans into space outweigh the risks. The risks are worth taking as they are highly trained astronauts who are aware of the risks they are taking. The benefits of sending humans into space include furthering our understanding of the universe and the potential to discover life on other planets. This is invaluable to us as a species and will be worth the risks taken. Furthermore, the risks are not as high as they used to be and the safety of the astronauts is a priority. Therefore, I believe that we should send humans into space.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Humans should be sent into space as it is important to further our understanding of space and the universe. The risks involved are worth the potential benefits of going into space.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Humans should be sent into space for exploration purposes but not for exploitation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that we should send humans into space. The reasons for this is that humans are the most advanced of the animals on earth and as such, are the most able to explore and investigate space and space exploration. While it is undeniable that it is an expensive and dangerous endeavor, there are many benefits that come from sending humans into space. It is often very necessary in exploration, as animals cannot consent to being in space, humans can and as such, it is much more ethical to send humans into space than animals. Furthermore, it is very important for scientific research and furthering our understanding of space. It allows us to better understand the planet we are on, as well as other planets.
