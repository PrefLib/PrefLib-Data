# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I think that we need to tackle health problems and obesity in children, and I can see how this might help; if children have more access to healthy affordable options and less unhealthy options are available to them. However, I think more focus should be given to educating children on the benefits of a balanced diet, promoting healthy eating and regular exercise. Removing fast food chains from near schools would inadvertently also impact local residents and the local economy. The best way to tackle obesity is to educate children on the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and exercise, and to make healthy food more accessible to them. This can be done by having more healthy food options in school canteens and by making healthy food more affordable. I don’t think that fast food chains should be banned from operating near schools because it is not the fast food chains that are making the children obese, it is the children who are making the decision to eat fast food. Instead, the children should be educated on the benefits of healthy eating and exercise, and the fast food chains should be encouraged to make their food healthier.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Fast food chains should be banned from operating near schools.  The issue of childhood obesity is a serious one.  Fast food is high in calories, sugar, salt and saturated fat.  It is also low in nutrients.  Fast food is also relatively cheap, and so is an attractive option for families on a budget.  Fast food is also widely available and so banning fast food chains from operating near schools may have an impact on childhood obesity.  However, fast food is also popular and so banning fast food chains from operating near schools may have an impact on the local economy.  Fast food can also be ordered via delivery companies, such as Just Eat, Uber Eats, Deliveroo, etc.  Therefore, banning fast food chains from operating near schools may not have the desired effect.  The issue of childhood obesity needs to be tackled and fast food may be part of the problem.  However, banning fast food chains from operating near schools may not be the solution.  There are many other factors that need to be considered, such as educating children on the benefits of a balanced diet, promoting healthy eating and regular exercise.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In principle, yes, fast food chains should be banned from operating near schools.  However, this is a very difficult thing to police and there are many other factors that need to be considered.  The issue of obesity is a complex one and we need to look at the bigger picture.  Education is key and children need to be taught about the importance of a balanced diet and regular exercise.  It is also important to consider the impact on local residents and the local economy.  A ban on fast food chains near schools would also impact local residents and the local economy.  The issue of obesity needs to be addressed at the source and fast food chains should be encouraged to use healthier cooking methods and ingredients.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of banning fast food chains from operating near schools.  It was felt that this would have a positive impact on childhood obesity.  It was also felt that this would be a positive step in educating children on the benefits of a balanced diet and regular exercise.  However, it was also recognised that this would have an impact on local residents and the local economy.  It was also recognised that this would not completely prevent children from accessing fast food.  It was felt that this would be a step in the right direction and would be a positive move for the health of children in the UK.
