# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of decriminalisation, but we did not all agree on the extent of this.  For example, we felt that it should be decriminalised for medical use, but we were less in favour of it being decriminalised for recreational use.  We felt that decriminalisation would lead to better regulation and support for addicts, and that there are too many people suffering in the criminal justice system as a result of cannabis use.  We felt that decriminalisation would lead to a reduction in crime and drug dealing.  However, we were also aware that cannabis is a public nuisance and could cause dangers, such as driving under the influence.  The group felt that cannabis is not as harmful as alcohol, and that it is not a gateway drug.  The group felt that the issue is not black and white, and that there are pros and cons to decriminalisation.  The group felt that cannabis use is a personal choice, and that people should be free to make their own choices.  However, we were also aware that cannabis use can be very harmful to some people, and that it can be a very difficult addiction to break.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final consensus statement: It would make sense to decriminalise the medicinal use of cannabis, however, it is important to have rigorous laws in place regarding recreational use to ensure that it remains properly monitored and regulated.  Overall, I believe that this opinion reflects the views of the wider public, and has the potential to positively impact society for the better.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We generally agree with the draft consensus statement, however, we feel it does not fully express our views on the issue.  In particular, we feel that it does not capture how we feel about the fact that cannabis is not as harmful as alcohol, and that it is not a gateway drug.  We also feel that it does not fully express our concerns about how cannabis use can be very harmful to some people, and that it can be a very difficult addiction to break.  We also feel that it does not fully express our views on the fact that cannabis use is a personal choice, and that people should be free to make their own choices.
