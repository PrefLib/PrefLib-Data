# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of putting a price on carbon, however, the devil is in the detail and the way in which this is implemented. The group discussed the idea of putting a price on carbon as a tax and also as a trading scheme. The group was in favour of a trading scheme, however, felt that this would be very difficult to implement. The group was also in favour of a tax on carbon, however, there was some debate on how this would be implemented. Some participants felt that this would need to be implemented across all countries and not just the UK. The group also discussed the idea of implementing a tax on carbon that would be used to subsidise the cost of renewable energy. This would encourage companies to invest in renewable energy and would also help to encourage individuals to invest in renewable energy. The group was in favour of this idea, however, it was also felt that this would be very difficult to implement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of putting a price on carbon. However, it was recognised that there are different types of carbon, some of which are beneficial to the environment, and others that are not. Therefore, the group felt that it would be important to differentiate between different types of carbon. The group also felt that it would be important to incentivise carbon-reducing behaviours, and that this could be achieved by providing a rebate to consumers who use low levels of carbon.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of putting a price on carbon. The group agreed that it is a good idea to put a price on carbon as it would hit companies where it hurts the most...their balance sheets. If it is going to cost them money and eat into their profits they are more likely to do something about it. It should encourage them to look for better cleaner, greener ways to run their business. It will encourage them to invest in solar power etc... It will also raise money from the companies that are polluting the environment , that can then be used to help repair some of the damage that they are causing. Obviously it would be much better for them to just reduce this damage they are causing in the first place and hopefully a carbon tax would encourage them to do this.
