# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of stopping the sale of diesel and petrol cars.  However, it was agreed that this should not happen immediately as the infrastructure for electric cars is not in place yet.  The group felt that the government should be investing in this infrastructure and making it easier for people to charge their cars.  The group also felt that the government should be providing more incentives for people to buy electric cars, such as tax breaks.  The group also felt that it would be unfair to stop selling diesel and petrol cars immediately as this would cause a lot of problems for people who rely on their cars for work.  The group felt that it would be more appropriate to stop selling diesel and petrol cars in 10-15 years time, when the infrastructure for electric cars is in place and people are more used to the idea of electric cars.  It was also felt that the government should be making it easier for people to install a charging point in their homes and that this should be subsidised to encourage people to buy electric cars.  The group felt that in 10-15 years time, the infrastructure for electric cars would be in place, there would be more charging points available and electric cars would be more affordable.  The group felt that

The group also felt that it would be important to put an end to selling diesel and petrol cars sooner rather than later, as this would be an important step in helping to reduce pollution and slow down climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The decision to stop the sale of diesel and petrol cars should not be taken straight away as people still rely on their cars and may not be able to afford to buy an electric car.  The government should be investing in the infrastructure for electric cars and making it easier for people to charge their electric cars.  The government should be providing more incentives for people to buy electric cars such as tax breaks.  The government should make electric cars more widely available and easier to buy to make them a more realistic alternative.  It would also be sensible to increase government grants for people who wish to buy electric cars.  The government could also incentivise car companies to focus on electric cars and/or impose taxes or other disincentives on cars that use petrol and diesel.  It is unlikely that a ban on the sale of diesel and petrol cars would be implemented for at least the next ten years, but by then it is likely that the situation with regard to electric cars will have changed.  In the meantime, electric cars can be encouraged without needing to implement a complete ban on petrol and diesel cars.
