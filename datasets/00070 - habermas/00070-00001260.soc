# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of legalisation of cannabis. This is because cannabis has proven health benefits and is also less harmful than alcohol. However, the group was less sure about legalisation of other recreational drugs. This is because some of these drugs are much more harmful than cannabis and legalisation of these drugs would be likely to lead to an increase in their use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While we believe that the legalisation of recreational drugs may have some benefits in terms of regulation and taxation, we also believe that it could also have some serious drawbacks. The primary benefit is that regulation of a legal drug market would reduce the black market value and appeal of illegal drugs. The second benefit is that taxation of a legal drug market could provide much needed revenue for drug abuse treatment and prevention programmes. We believe that these benefits are very real and could potentially have a significant impact on illegal drug use. However, we are also of the opinion that there are some serious drawbacks to the legalisation of drugs. For example, a potential increase in drug related health issues is a concern, since we believe that it is very unlikely that the introduction of drugs like cannabis would lead to a corresponding decrease in the consumption of other illegal drugs. Also, we are concerned that any potential benefits may be offset by the increased availability of legal drugs. Finally, we are concerned about the potential for an increase in the abuse of legal drugs. Therefore, we believe that any drug policy must be very carefully thought out and include these factors in its consideration.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although cannabis should be legalised in certain situations, other recreational drugs like cocaine should not be legalised, and the use of cannabis should only be allowed for prescription use by medical professionals, so that it can be properly controlled.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, we believe that the legalisation of cannabis would be beneficial to society. It would allow for better regulation and taxation of the drug. This would mean that the government would be able to provide more support for those who are dependent on the drug and also provide more support for those who are trying to give up the drug. It would also mean that the government would be able to provide more support for people who have health conditions that can be treated by the drug. We also believe that legalisation would reduce the crime associated with cannabis. However, we also recognise that there are some negatives to legalisation. It is possible that it could increase the number of people who use the drug. It could also lead to people driving under the influence of the drug, which could lead to an increase in the number of road traffic accidents. It could also lead to people using the drug in a way that it was not intended to be used, such as smoking it. This could lead to an increase in the number of people who have health problems as a result of using the drug.
