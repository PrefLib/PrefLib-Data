However, the group felt that safeguarding should be prioritised. Therefore, if a child is at risk of harm, for example, being groomed by a paedophile, or is at risk of being sexually exploited, then they should not be allowed to opt out. The group also felt that if a child is not safe at home, for example, if there is a perpetrator in the home, then they should not be allowed to opt out. However, the group was unsure about how this could be put into practice.
