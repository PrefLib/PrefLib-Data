# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In summer, dogs should be allowed on beaches only in limited areas with adequate signage informing dog owners where they can walk their dogs. It is unreasonable to expect dog owners to only walk their dogs on the beach during the winter. People with dogs are also people and as such they should be allowed to enjoy the outdoors in the summer too.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should not walk their dogs on the beach during the summer. If they really want to go on the beach, they can go during winter. If people really wanted to take their dogs on the beach, it would be better for them to go on a lead so that they do not disturb other beach users.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should not be allowed to walk their dogs on the beach in the summer because it will contaminate the sand and potentially make children who are playing in the sand ill. The next exercise involved groups of participants who were each given a particular role in relation to a 'dog mess on the beach' incident that had occurred.  The roles were: Participant A: You are a local resident who has been walking your dog on the beach with your children. Your children have been rolling around in the sand, but you forgot to clean up after your dog and one of the children is now throwing up and having diarrhoea. Participant B: You are the person that the parent in Participant A is calling. You are a medical professional at the local hospital. Participant C: You are the Environmental Health Officer of the local council. You have been informed of the incident. Participant D: You are the press reporter who has been informed of the incident and is writing an article on it. Participant E: You are the Mayor of the local council. You have been informed of the incident and are writing a speech about it for the evening news. After everyone had read their roles, a group discussion
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Dogs should be allowed on the beach at all times of the year. People take their dogs to the beach to play and run about and get rid of energy, so it would be a shame to stop them from doing that. The beach is a great place for people and their dogs to spend time together. As long as the dogs are well behaved, there is no reason for them to be excluded from the beach. If a dog is on the beach, it should be kept on a lead unless it is playing in the water. In any case, the dog should always be supervised. Any dog owner should clean up after their dog as soon as it has done its business and remove it from the beach. There is no reason why people shouldn't be able to walk their dogs on the beach in the summer. It would be nice if dogs were allowed in more public places. It would be more inclusive. It would also be good for the dogs themselves. It is important to keep dogs busy and active.
