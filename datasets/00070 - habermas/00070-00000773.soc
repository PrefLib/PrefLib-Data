# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the government should encourage greater investment in sustainable energy by subsidising it. This is because increased access to this is likely to lead to the UK being a lesser cause of global warming. That said there is a distinction between sustainable and renewable energy, where sustainable energy can be harmful to the environment through releasing fossil fuels, but still sustainable because the government can continue to afford and source it. Assuming the question is referring to renewable energy- it is a great idea for the government to subsidise this because individuals are unlikely to be able to afford these methods by themselves, and the scheme is more likely to be used by government buildings, hospitals and other significant users of energy than if individuals were funding it. On the other hand, if the government is funding this energy, people may be inclined to waste energy since it is free, or continue to use the same amount of fossil fuels as before. To ensure that the shift to renewable/sustainable energy is not negated by people using more energy than they normally would have- limits could be placed on overall energy or fuel consumption.
