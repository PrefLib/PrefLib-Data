# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There are benefits to being vegan in terms of reducing the carbon footprint and also in terms of reducing animal cruelty. However, it is not an easy lifestyle to adopt and the group felt that it is more important to reduce meat consumption rather than cutting it out completely. The group also felt that it is important to buy local produce and to buy organic where possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although there are arguments to both sides as to whether veganism makes a positive environmental impact, we think vegans do contribute in terms of reducing the carbon footprint by reduction of meat and dairy producing farming. However their consumption of vegan products comes with a high carbon footprint as well if they are imported and highly processed. Organic Foods: Do They Have a Future? The below participants were asked to come up with a consensus opinion on whether they believe organic food has a future. Below are presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It was agreed that the overall contribution of vegans is positive for the world. Participants appreciated that the Vegan lifestyle promotes healthy foods, a healthy lifestyle and a more ethical way of living. The downside was thought to be the high carbon footprint that comes with importing Vegan products and the potential to upset consumers and lose them if they are not careful in how they portray Veganism. It was thought that the media portrayal of Vegans as animal rights activists is unfair, as it is not the whole story.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of the vegan lifestyle and thought that it was making a positive contribution to the world. The group thought that veganism was a good way to reduce the impact of climate change, and to improve animal welfare. The group did not think that the vegan lifestyle was the only way to reduce climate change, and thought that reducing meat and dairy consumption would also be beneficial. The group also thought that the vegan lifestyle was not the easiest lifestyle to live, and that it would be hard to maintain in the long term. The group thought that veganism was a good way to raise awareness of climate change and animal welfare, but that it could also alienate people.
