# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We don't think it will have a positive impact on productivity. We feel that it is very unlikely that it will have a negative impact on productivity. We feel that it will have a neutral impact on productivity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It can be agreed that Universal Basic Income will have a positive impact on productivity but it is difficult to judge how big that impact would be. If UBI is large enough to be a motivator to the unemployed to take a low paying job it would increase productivity. If UBI is small enough to keep people with low productivity in their jobs, productivity would remain about the same.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: UBI has the potential to have a positive impact on productivity. If we agree that it will improve health and happiness, then surely this will improve productivity?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was of the opinion that the introduction of a universal basic income will have a positive impact on productivity. The participants felt that the introduction of a universal basic income would allow people to take on jobs that they previously would not have been able to due to the low pay. This would allow them to develop new skills and experience which would then allow them to move into better paid jobs in the future. The participants also felt that a universal basic income would allow people to take more risks in terms of starting their own businesses and developing their own ideas. The participants felt that the introduction of a universal basic income would allow people to be more creative in terms of developing new products and services which would lead to greater productivity in the economy.
