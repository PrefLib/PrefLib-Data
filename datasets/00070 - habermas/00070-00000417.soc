# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be no gender inequality in STEM subjects from primary school and up.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, gender inequality in STEM subjects starts in primary school but not as much as in secondary school. This is an example of a good consensus statement as it is short and to the point but still gives an overall view of the topic. The statement is in no way biased and gives a good insight into the groups views on the subject.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although gender inequality in STEM subjects does not necessarily start in primary school, the school should be more active in ensuring that children are not placed into roles that match traditional gender stereotypes and should be more active in ensuring that boys and girls have equal opportunity to take part in STEM subjects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “I do not believe that gender inequality in STEM subjects starts in primary school as I think it is more of a societal issue that is embedded in our culture. I do believe that gender inequality starts from home and then is followed through in the school environment and in the workplace. I do not think that it is necessarily the fault of the school as they are trying to encourage gender equality in STEM subjects and to ensure that this is the case. However, the schools cannot change the views of the parents and society in general and so this can lead to a continuation of gender inequality.”
