# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, we feel that banning the sale of gasoline and diesel powered cars by 2035 would be a step in the right direction in regards to combating climate change. Electric powered cars would be cheaper to run, especially as they have no need for fuel and servicing costs would be reduced due to the technology being relatively new. As there would be no emissions being produced the health benefits would be numerous. This is something that we feel the government should seriously consider.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that by 2035 the sale of petrol and diesel cars should be banned to allow for more people to purchase electric cars. To ensure this happens the government will need to support people who cannot afford the change with subsidies to help with the cost.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of moving towards a low carbon future, and had in fact all previously indicated a desire to be included in the climate action movement. However, there were some concerns raised as to the overall feasibility of this and the length of time in which this should take place. The consensus was that the government should support those who need it the most, and if we are to achieve the target of 2035 then this would require some action in the immediate future. The group agreed that the way forward is to start educating people in schools as to the benefits of this transition to a low carbon future. However, it was also acknowledged that this was a complex issue and not all of the concerns were addressed during this deliberation exercise. The group was made up of young people who, despite living in an affluent part of the world, had some concerns that they might not be able to afford electric cars, especially with electricity costs currently at an all time high. It was also acknowledged that the current technology of electric cars might not be the best option for the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should ban the sale of gasoline and diesel powered cars by 2035 to reduce the impact of global warming. The ban would be implemented over a period of ten years to allow people to transition to electric cars, however people would be encouraged to buy electric cars before the ban was put into place to aid the reduction of pollution and the benefits of electric cars would be highlighted by the government.
