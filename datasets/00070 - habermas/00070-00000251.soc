# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the UK does enough to help less well-off countries. In countries where the distribution of resources to the people is unbalanced or where political or social conditions are corrupt or inefficient, the impact of aid and other forms of support may not be enough. More support should be offered to those countries that are doing their best to share resources among their people, and also to support any country that is trying to improve its political or social conditions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - As a country we should be more active in helping other countries. If we see any form of crisis, be it famine, political unrest, natural disasters etc, we should look to help. The extent to which we help would depend on a range of factors, and also how many countries would be willing to help as well. We also need to ensure that we do not allow help to be misdirected away from those who actually need it. Also, it is also important to remember that we should not feel responsible for other countries. Their political and social issues are of their own making and therefore should not expect us to help them. If we can help, we should, but if not, it is not our problem.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In principle, yes we should help less well-off countries, but we must be careful that the aid we provide is not just seen as a 'cash-transfer' that does not lead to any lasting improvements in the wellbeing of the recipients. We must be certain that our aid has the capacity to effect lasting change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should help the less well off countries as it will increase stability and prosperity in those areas. It will also reduce the instability and refugee crisis that is happening now.
