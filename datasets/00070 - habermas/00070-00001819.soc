# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should heavily subsidise electric vehicles in order to support the idea that fossil fuels are no longer needed. This could be done by giving every household a voucher to pay towards the cost of buying an electric car. The government should also give a grant to all those wanting to get an electric car charging point installed. The cost of electric cars is too high for most people and the range of most electric cars is still too short to make them a practical choice. The government should also do more to make electric cars cheaper for everyone to buy and increase the charging points so it is easier for electric cars to be used on a daily basis. The extra tax from the current car tax system should also be ringfenced to pay for the subsidies on electric cars and other green projects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should subsidise electric vehicles. This is because they are much better for the environment than cars powered by fossil fuels. The government are already doing a lot to encourage people to buy electric vehicles, including emissions zones in major cities and failing older vehicles on emissions tests during the MOT. However, electric vehicles are out of reach financially for most people. There is also the issue of charging electric cars - for instance, there would be nowhere I could have an electric charging point installed for an electric vehicle since I live in a terraced house with no driveway. The government should subsidise electric vehicles, and also make it easier for people to have charging points installed. This could be done by providing grants for people to have charging points installed, and also making it easier to get planning permission for charging points to be installed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should subsidise electric vehicles, but it should be the people who currently own non-electric vehicles that contribute to this. This will also help reduce the amount of money the government will have to provide.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should provide subsidies to the public for the purchase of electric vehicles, and to invest in the infrastructure for electric vehicles.
