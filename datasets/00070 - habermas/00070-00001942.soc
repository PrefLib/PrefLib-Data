# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of allowing people to sell their organs, but only if the following conditions were met:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the decision that it is acceptable to pay people to have their organs removed to help other people. This is because there are people in desperate need of organs and they are often waiting months for a donation. This would also provide an opportunity for people to make some money, as many people are in need of money. However, there should be some regulation, to make sure that vulnerable people are not taken advantage of and that people are not selling organs that they need to survive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is morally acceptable to pay people to have their organs removed to help other people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the idea of selling organs to save the life of another person is acceptable. However, there are a number of issues that need to be considered. In order to ensure that there is no abuse of the system and that the donors are properly cared for, there should be very strict guidelines put in place. The government should have a hand in it as well, and there should be a clear cut pricing system that is not left to the discretion of the buyer and seller. The people who need the organs should not have to pay for them, but instead the government should fund the operation. There needs to be proper evaluation of both the buyer and seller of the organs as well. The buyer should not be trying to scam the system by getting an organ for free, and the seller should be sure that the organ is actually needed.
