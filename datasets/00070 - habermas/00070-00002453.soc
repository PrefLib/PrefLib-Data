# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that hunting for sport is wrong. We believe that hunting for food is okay, but we do not think that hunting for sport is okay. We think that if an animal is going to be killed, it should be for a good reason, such as food, and not for sport. We think that if a species is endangered or protected, it should not be hunted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to hunting for sport. We felt that the only time it was acceptable to hunt was when it was for food, or when the species was in some way a pest. We felt that hunting foxes was wrong, and should be banned. We also felt that hunting endangered species was wrong, and should be banned. We felt that hunting was a very outdated pastime, and that it was not something that was very common in todays society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of hunting for sport. The group felt that hunting for food was more acceptable, but that it was important to ensure that the animal was killed in a humane way.
