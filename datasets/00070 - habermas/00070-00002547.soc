# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I believe this is a nice idea in principle but not quite sure how practical it is in the current climate. Whilst I do think think there needs to be more done to support the arts I don't feel this is the way. The best thing to do make towns and cities look better is to properly stimulate the economy. The more shops that end up derelict and abandoned the worse areas look. I'd far rather the government prioritise this at the moment than public art. That's not to say in a more prosperous time it wouldn't be a bad idea.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, I agree that this is something the government should fund as we live in cities and are affected by our environment. Art is something to be appreciated and it increases the attractiveness of a town. Art brings people together and it would be useful to promote tourism.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I think it is always a good idea to improve the appearance of cities, so it sounds like a good idea to me. With that being said, there are definitely more pressing issues that require government funding at the moment. I am also not very knowledgeable on what a public art programme would look like exactly and how much it would cost the government so I am not entirely sure my answer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think perhaps some funding could be allocated towards this, however I don't feel this is one of the main urgent causes that the government needs to focus on.
