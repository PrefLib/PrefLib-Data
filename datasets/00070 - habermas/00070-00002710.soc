# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of increasing national pride.  They felt that the idea of national pride was too closely linked to nationalism and exceptionalism, and that these were dangerous ideas that could lead to xenophobia and a lack of concern for other countries.  They felt that it would be better to encourage a pride in our own achievements and the achievements of those around us, rather than pride in our country.  They felt that this would lead to a greater sense of community and belonging, without the negative side effects of nationalism.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of encouraging more national pride. The group felt that this would help to foster a greater sense of community and belonging, which would in turn lead to a greater willingness to work to improve the country for everyone in it. However, the group also felt that it was important to be careful about the type of national pride that was being encouraged. The group felt that it was important to encourage a pride in the country and its people, but that it was also important to avoid encouraging a pride in the country that was exceptionalist or that encouraged a sense of superiority. The group also felt that it was important to ensure that the encouragement of national pride did not lead to a greater sense of nationalism or xenophobia, and that it was important to ensure that the encouragement of national pride did not lead to a greater sense of division between the UK and the rest of the world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of a greater degree of national pride, but with some caveats. The group felt that there was a need for a greater degree of national pride, since this would lead to a greater sense of belonging and community, which would in turn lead to people being more invested in the country and wanting to work to improve it. However, the group was also wary of the potential negative effects of encouraging national pride, since this could lead to the rise of nationalism and exceptionalism, which could in turn lead to xenophobia and a lack of empathy for people outside of the country. The group felt that there was a need to be very careful about the way in which national pride was encouraged, to ensure that it did not lead to these negative effects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we should not be encouraging a greater degree of national pride. The issue of national pride is complicated. On the one hand, national pride can be a good thing, as it can make people care more about their country and the people in it. However, it can also lead to dangerous attitudes such as exceptionalism and nationalism. In the current climate, with Brexit and the rise of nationalism, we should be encouraging a sense of global pride and a sense of belonging to the world, rather than just to one country.
