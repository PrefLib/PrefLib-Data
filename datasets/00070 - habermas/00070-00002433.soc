# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of more heavily subsidizing electric vehicles. The group felt that the current subsidies are not enough to encourage people to move to electric vehicles, and that the government should do more to help people make the switch. The group felt that this would be a good way to help the environment and improve air quality. The group also felt that this would help to improve public transport, as people would be less likely to use their cars. However, the group also felt that this alone is not enough. The group felt that improvements to public transport should also be made, and that other measures should be taken to help the environment. The group felt that electric cars are a good way to improve the environment, but that this is only one step, and that other measures must also be taken.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the government subsidizing electric vehicles. The group felt that the environmental impacts of petrol/diesel vehicles far outweighed the costs of encouraging electric vehicles. However, there was a feeling that this should be done in conjunction with other measures, such as improving public transport. The group was split on whether this should be done in the form of a tax on petrol/diesel vehicles, or by subsidizing electric vehicles. The group also discussed whether this should be done for private vehicles, or for public transport vehicles. The group was split on this, with some feeling that this should be done for both and others feeling that this should be done for only public transport vehicles. The group also discussed whether this should be done in the UK only, or in other countries. The group felt that this should be done in other countries, as it would have a bigger impact.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Electric vehicles should be heavily subsidized by the government. The ill effects of burning fossil fuels for vehicles on the environment and climate have been well documented, and it would be foolish not to encourage electric cars in this way, and phase out petrol/diesel cars completely. Electric vehicles have less of an impact on the environment, and are also cheaper to run. The group of participants also agreed that the government should also heavily subsidize the installation of electric vehicle charging points, and provide grants for the installation of home charging points. The group of participants also agreed that the government should provide grants for the installation of solar panels on people's homes, to help to power electric vehicles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of more heavily subsidizing electric vehicles. The group felt that the current subsidies are not enough to encourage people to move to electric vehicles, and that the government should do more to help people make the switch. The group felt that this would be a good way to help the environment and improve air quality. The group also felt that this would help to improve public transport, as people would be less likely to use their cars. However, the group also felt that this alone is not enough. The group felt that improvements to public transport should also be made, and that other measures should be taken to help the environment. The group also felt that it would be a good idea to encourage people to drive less and use public transport more, so this should also be subsidised.
