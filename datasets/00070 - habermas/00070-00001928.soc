# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group felt that divorce should be made easier in the UK. With the amount of people getting married and divorced increasing, the process has to be changed. The amount of legal battles and solicitor fees means that the process takes longer and is more expensive than it needs to be. This causes stress and anxiety for the couple, which in turn causes mental health issues. The process should be cheaper and quicker. If there is no dispute between the couple then it should not take months of paperwork to get divorced.

The group felt that divorce should be a mutual decision and that the process should be as quick and painless as possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We feel that divorce in the UK should be made easier for people who both want to end their marriage. We feel that people should be able to get divorced without spending a fortune on solicitors and that it should be a quick process, which is amicable between the couple. The current system is antiquated and there is no need for solicitors to get involved when a couple mutually agree to end their marriage. Conclusion To summarize, consensus statements present a way for a group of participants to present their views on a given subject.
