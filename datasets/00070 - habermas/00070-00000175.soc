# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, adults should be allowed to make their own decisions about what they want to do with their own bodies. However, drugs are illegal in the UK and are therefore associated with many risks. Using drugs is often an irresponsible choice that is likely to have serious and sometimes life-threatening consequences. If an adult is doing drugs in a way that is putting themselves or others in danger, then they should be stopped from doing so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is not appropriate for adults to do drugs at parties, and adults who do so are putting others at risk, whether by making the drugs accessible to others, or by being under the influence of drugs and acting in dangerous or unpredictable ways.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The consequences of drug use by adults can impact on others who may be exposed to it. So it is not appropriate to do drugs at parties. Drug use should be limited to controlled environments and contexts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - it would depend on the situation, if it's to have fun and it won't affect others around them in a negative way, then they can feel free, but they should still know the implications of doing so.
