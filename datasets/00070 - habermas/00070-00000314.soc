# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the internet is a force for good in society. The internet has increased access to knowledge and resources to people, and changed the way we live and work. However, there are some negative aspects of the internet, including the creation of new crimes and digital divide between the haves and have nots.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the internet is a force for good in society. The internet has increased access to knowledge and resources to people, and changed the way we live and work. However, there are some negative aspects of the internet, including the creation of new crimes, crimes in the dark web, and abuse of people. Conclusion: The round-table discussions on various questions and topics were very enlightening, and led to interesting points being made by the participants. Through these round-table discussions, the group of participants came to consensus opinions on the various questions, though a good debate and discussion. As part of the research for the development of the "Human Capital (Innovation and Technological Change)" Topic Outline, the research group conducted a series of in-depth interviews with various individuals with experience in the field, to find out what are the key areas that need to be studied by students in their JC and A Level years.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the internet is a force for good in society. The internet has increased access to knowledge and resources to people, and changed the way we live and work. It is also used to allow for new and creative ideas to be spread across the world, creating opportunities and change for people. The dark web is not something that should be ignored, as it is a hotbed for crime, such as human trafficking, child pornography, drug sales and more. In this example, it is clear that the way the question is phrased can skew the debate in one way or another. By framing the question as "Is the internet a force for good or evil?", it leads the discussion into a debate between the pros and cons of the internet, rather than the participants coming to a middle ground. It is important to frame the question in a way that is neutral, allowing the debate to flow naturally and not be steered in one direction or another.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The internet is a force for good in society, by allowing people to access knowledge and resources, and change the way we live and work. However, there are some negative aspects of the internet, including the creation of new crimes, crimes in the dark web, abuse of people, and digital divide between the haves and have nots. We had some disagreements and some very strong views that were contrary to each other, but the above is a consensus view of all four participants. We all agreed that the internet has both positive and negative aspects, and we have come up with a view that we all agree on.
