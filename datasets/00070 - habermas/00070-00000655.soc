# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of building new nuclear power stations in the UK. It was felt that this would help reduce the UK's dependency on fossil fuels and would help the UK reduce its carbon footprint. It was also felt that this would help address the spiralling cost of electricity for consumers. However, the group also felt that the UK should invest in developing renewable energy sources such as wind farms and solar power. The group felt that the UK should be doing everything it can to reduce its dependency on energy provided by countries outside the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of building new nuclear power stations in the UK. The group felt that this would be a way of reducing our dependency on fossil fuels and help us move towards a greener future. The group did however feel that more research into renewable energy sources should be carried out. The group also felt that nuclear power stations should be built in more remote locations, away from densely populated areas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of building new nuclear power stations in the UK. It was felt that the need to move away from fossil fuels was a key driver for the construction of new nuclear power stations. There was a feeling that in the long term the construction of new nuclear power stations would be beneficial to the UK economy. However, the construction of new nuclear power stations would be at the expense of the environment.
