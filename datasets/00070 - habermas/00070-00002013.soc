# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not fair to discriminate against anyone with the provision of medical care. Everyone should have equal access to free medical care, regardless of their background.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, it is not fair to provide free medical care to some people but not others. Medical care should be a basic human right, and so everyone should have access to it regardless of their background. While it is understandable that some medical conditions on the face of it seem more warranted in terms of providing the sufferer free care; however, I believe that everyone should have access to free medical care. The need for a 'one rule for all' law is important to provide clarity, and taking a case-by-case basis when it comes to providing free medical care can become very confusing. Medical care should be a human right provided by governments, so everyone should be entitled to this regardless of their medical conditions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While the provision of free universal healthcare is a human right, there are some special cases where it is fair to provide free medical care to some people but not others. In these special cases, people with life threatening illnesses and conditions should receive free medical care, while those with non-life threatening illnesses and conditions should have to pay for the healthcare they receive. There are many different ways of financing free universal healthcare for life threatening illnesses and conditions, including taxes and state contributions, so that everyone can receive the same quality of healthcare.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, it is not fair to provide free medical care to some but not others. Everyone should have equal access to medical care, and it should be free, regardless of their background. The need for a 'one rule for all' law is important to provide clarity, and taking a case-by-case basis when it comes to providing free medical care can become very confusing. Medical care should be a human right provided by governments, so everyone should be entitled to this regardless of their medical conditions.
