# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of encouraging the eating of insects. The main reasons for this were that insects are living creatures and should not be eaten. The group also felt that encouraging people to eat insects was not a realistic solution to the problem of climate change, and that the real solution was to stop eating meat. The group felt that the idea of eating insects was not realistic and that it would not be widely adopted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We are against the eating of insects to save the planet because the participants do not believe that people will be willing to do so as a means of cutting meat consumption, especially in the Western world. Also, it's worth noting that eating insects doesn't really solve any issues, it just moves the problem from one to the other.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have a number of different opinions on the topic, but we have found common ground. We all agree that, at this point in time, we would not personally choose to eat insects. We also don't think anyone should be forced to eat them, and that some sort of a gradual change would be the most beneficial way of moving people towards a change in their diets. We also all agree that eating insects could have a positive environmental impact, and that it is also a healthy and nutritious option for people, even though we would not be personally choosing to eat them ourselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the idea of encouraging the eating of insects is a good one, as it is a more environmentally friendly way of producing protein. However, it is not necessary to ban the eating of meat in order to encourage this. In fact, this would be counterproductive, as it would likely cause a backlash. Instead, it would be better to encourage the eating of insects as an alternative to meat, and to make it more widely available and palatable.
