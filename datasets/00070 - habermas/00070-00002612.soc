# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I don't believe we should encourage everyone to get a degree. I do not believe a degree is necessary anymore, as the value of the degree is lessening with every passing year, while tuition costs are heavily increasing. I believe young people are already pressured to go into high amounts of debt for a subject or field that they may not necessarily end up in, leaving them with excessive debt, and a useless degree.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should encourage everyone to get a degree because a highly educated society is good for everyone.  Teaching to a higher education standard helps foster critical thinking.  We are watching the cult of Trump amongst poorly educated Americans who are quick to jump to conclusions about "other" - refugees, gay, trans, anyone not "them".  We all deserve to carry on learning and to expand our knowledge.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I think that alternative forms of education should be emphasied as valid (apprentices, internships etc.). Not everyone is going to thrive in or enjoy an academic setting and lots of academic subjects might be better taught in an alternative, more practical way (such as engineering). 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although earning a degree can be a good opportunity for some people, it is not necessary for everybody. Plenty of people that don't have degrees are successful and have good jobs. Many people get degrees because they think they should but they don't actually need it. Many people end up in debt because of their degree and they never even end up using it. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - Whilst I wouldn't necessarily encourage everyone to get a degree, I would encourage people to continue learning and to want to learn. I think the love of learning is something that should be encouraged more in school, as should the capability to think critically.
