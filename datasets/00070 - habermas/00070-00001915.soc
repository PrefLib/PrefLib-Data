# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It was agreed that everyone should have to pay some form of income tax, regardless of their income. However, those earning under the current minimum wage should be taxed only a small amount, so that they can afford the basics. Employers should be paying minimum wage, as it is a crime to make people work for less than the minimum wage. Those who earn under the current minimum wage should also have their income tax rebated to them, so that they do not end up in debt. This is because if they are earning less than the minimum wage, it is likely that they cannot pay for basic things such as food, water and electricity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the conclusion that those who earn less than minimum wage should not have to pay income tax. This is because they are already struggling to make ends meet and if they were to pay income tax, they would be unable to afford basic necessities such as food and bills. This would mean that they would be living in poverty. We believe that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that everyone is paid a minimum wage, and that this should be enough for people to live on. Therefore, we believe that those who earn less than minimum wage should not have to pay income tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, people should have to pay income tax, however people who earn less than minimum wage should be exempt from having to pay income tax.
