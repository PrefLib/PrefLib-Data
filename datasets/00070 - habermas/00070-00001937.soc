# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the monarchy is outdated and serves no purpose, other than entertainment for tourists. However, changing the system for selecting a monarch will not resolve this. In order to truly have a fair society, the position of the monarch should be abolished, so that people are no longer subject to this outdated institution.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of a new system for selecting a monarch. However, the group was split as to whether the UK should have a monarch at all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should have a new system for selecting the monarch. The current system is outdated and doesn't represent the views of the people. It is a legalised cult that has no place in modern society. The new system should be one where the people can vote for who they want as monarch.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Should the UK have a new system for selecting the monarch?
