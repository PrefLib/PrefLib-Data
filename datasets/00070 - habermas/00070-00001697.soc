# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe the monarchy is something the UK should be proud of and we think it should be kept. The monarchy has provided a sense of continuity and tradition that transcends politics, and it is a big part of British culture and tradition. Many other countries also love it, and wish they had something similar. It also has a positive economic impact on the UK. However, we believe there are some ways the monarchy can be improved. They should be less extravagant, to represent modern times, and they should reduce their use of personal expense, such as helicopter travel, when public transport is available. We also think the UK government should introduce a bill to enshrine the protection of the royal family in law. We think this is necessary due to the increasingly aggressive nature of the media, who are publishing more and more inaccurate information about the royal family. The law should protect the royal family from malicious media and also protect the royal family from scandals. If the royal family is to remain in the UK, the UK government should protect it's citizens from these scandals and malicious media reporting, and the law should be used to prevent this. This law should have a wide scope, to protect all royals and their families from the malicious press.

We don't want the monarchy to become 'just like everyone else'; this would dilute the 'brand' somewhat. However, we believe there are some ways the monarchy can be improved. They should be less extravagant, to represent modern times, and they should reduce their use of personal expense, such as helicopter travel, when public transport is available.

They should be less extravagant, to represent modern times, and they should reduce their use of personal expense, such as helicopter travel, when public transport is available. We also believe that the royal family should continue to be involved in the national conversation and debate and use their position to help solve issues in society. For example, with the recent case of the Duchess of Cambridge's brother James Middleton opening up about his depression, this shows how the royal family can help raise awareness of serious issues in society and help to reduce the stigma surrounding them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe the monarchy is something the UK should be proud of. They provide a sense of continuity and tradition that transcends politics, and are a big part of British culture and tradition. In the modern age they should reduce their personal use of public funds, but the monarchy should be kept.
