# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be greater controls over the use of pesticides. Pesticides can be harmful to the environment and people. In the 1970s, DDT was banned as it caused damage to the ozone layer and was detrimental to wildlife. The banning of pesticides can have negative consequences such as lower crop yield and lower quality of crops. Therefore, there should not be a complete ban on pesticides but we need to be more careful and aware of their use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, we believe that there should be greater controls over the use of pesticides as they can be dangerous and detrimental to the environment and our health. Pesticides can also have a negative impact on wildlife. However, there should be no outright ban on the use of pesticides as we can see that in some circumstances, their use can be advantageous. Pesticides can be very useful in that they can improve crop yield and increase the longevity of crops which can be beneficial to developing countries and improve the food security of the population. Therefore, it is important to come up with an appropriate balance. This section of the meeting concludes with a round of applause and a glass of wine as a toast to a very productive session of consensus building.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We agree that there should be greater controls over the use of pesticides. While pesticides can be very useful in that they can improve crop yield and increase the longevity of crops which can be beneficial to developing countries and improve the food security of the population, they can also be dangerous and detrimental to the environment and our health. Therefore, we believe that there should be no outright ban on the use of pesticides. Instead, we propose that there should be an appropriate balance of controls in place to monitor the use of pesticides.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Pesticides have a number of negative effects on the environment and human health. However, there are also some positive effects, such as the fact that they can improve crop yield and increase the longevity of crops. It is important to find an appropriate balance.
