# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: They should yes, it should start with more information at the educational level. More funds should be allocated to teach about drug use and its effects in Secondary schools. And more widely, there should be campagins arranged by the government and NHS to provide more information on a consistent basis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In theory yes, but I do not see how more funding will work in reality. Children are taught about drug misuse from primary school onwards and through high school. Drugs will always be available both legally and illegally, no matter how much money is spent on programmes to reduce and prevent drug use. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: i think more funds might help as long as they are spent wisely and where they'd be the most help, as in on the ground face to face assistants and not on office admin and loads of managers. also there will always be issues its not a curiable situation 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Drugs are substances that affect the physiology of the body, some drugs can be very harmful and afflict the body whereas other drugs (medicinal) can have healing properties and can be conjugated in surgery and other applications of science. A lot of people suffer from recreational drug addictions which in turn ruins their life and eventually leads them to death and so funds and programs should be allocated as a means to rectify the issue as well as seeking to permanently ban the use of recreational drugs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I think more funds should be allocated to prevent drug use. Drug use is a very big issue in the UK. Drug use is getting more and more common now within children. More funds should be available to services that help people, not only getting clean from drugs, but also to prevent drug use with younger people. More funding being allocated to prevent drug use would also mean that, on the long run, drug inflicted injuries or emergencies were not putting as much strain on our NHS.
