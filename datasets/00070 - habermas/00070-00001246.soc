# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the government should not ban the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad, because it will not solve the problem. The government should instead take action to help improve working conditions in these countries and give these workers a fair wage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should force companies that operate in the United Kingdom to pay their workers a decent wage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In principle, the government should ban the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad, however, the issue is more complex than that and it is not as simple as banning the sale of these products. In reality, it would be very difficult to enforce and monitor such a ban and companies would simply sell their products to other countries. It is also difficult to decide what is an underpaid worker and what is a fair wage in different countries. Therefore, it would be better to intervene with global policy and get all countries to increase standards of production.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is unfair that workers in developing countries are exploited to produce goods that are imported into the United Kingdom. However, it is difficult to define what is an underpaid worker and how to regulate the process. Also, the ban would have a huge effect on the economy as the vast majority of goods sold in the UK are imported. It is best to tackle the issue at source by working with global policy to improve working conditions and ensure workers are paid a decent wage.
