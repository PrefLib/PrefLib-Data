# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: In general, the group was in favour of limiting the use of cars in central London. However, it was felt that a complete ban would not be practical and that there would need to be some exemptions. These exemptions would include emergency vehicles, taxis, and private vehicles for residents. The group felt that there would need to be a transition period to allow people to adjust to the new rules and that there would need to be a period of consultation with London residents and businesses to allow them to have their say on the matter. __________________________ If you would like help having a debate (virtually) using the
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of limiting the use of cars in central London. However, it was felt that a complete ban would not be practical and that there would need to be some exemptions.

The group felt that there would need to be a transition period to allow people to adjust to the new rules and that there would need to be a period of consultation with London residents and businesses to allow them to have their say on the matter. The group felt that it was also important to note that there were many benefits to be gained from limiting car usage in central London, such as less pollution, less congestion, and more space for cyclists and pedestrians.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The initial draft consensus statement reflects the views of most in the group. That statement is accurate to the extent that it reflects a view that cars should be reduced in number in London, particularly in the centre. However, no group members had an opinion that cars should be completely banned in central London. It is felt that while this may help to reduce pollution and congestion, it would not be practical because many people who live in central London would be forced to keep their cars outside of the centre. There would also need to be exemptions for emergency vehicles and taxis (including private hire vehicles and minicabs). It is also felt that people would require time to prepare for such a dramatic change as an all-out ban of cars, particularly for businesses to adjust the way they operate. It is recommended that before considering a ban, the government should consult with Londoners to see if the majority would support it, and to prepare a plan for the ban to be implemented.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a ban on all private vehicles in Central London. There should be exemptions for emergency vehicles, taxis, and private vehicles for residents. There should be a transition period to allow people to adjust to the new rules and there should be a period of consultation with London residents and businesses to allow them to have their say on the matter.
