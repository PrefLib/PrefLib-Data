# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the UK remaining as it is.  However, it was recognised that there are some areas where the devolution of power to the constituent countries of the UK would be beneficial.  For example, in education, each country could develop its own curriculum and qualifications, which would be more suited to the needs of the people in that country.  This would allow for greater flexibility and innovation.  It was also recognised that the countries of the UK could work more closely together in areas such as trade and defence.  This would allow the UK to remain a strong and united force in the world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK is a small country in terms of global status, and to break away would be a huge risk. In the face of the world stage we are currently governed well and to separate could cause rifts between nations and make us less powerful. The 4 countries that make up the UK are governed as one at present and the benefits of this are plain to see, with shared resources and ideas we are a stronger country. We should keep our strong links with each other, but there should be a voice for each of the 4 nations so that no decisions are taken without a representative from each of the nations to ensure each of the 4 nations are being looked after.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The participants feel that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should become independent countries because we can then provide more support to each of our own regions, whilst still having our representation in the government and House of Commons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the countries becoming independent, however, they did not want to make any decisions without considering the views of the people of the UK. The participants agreed that they would carry out a survey to find out the views of the people of the UK and then make a decision based on the results of the survey.
