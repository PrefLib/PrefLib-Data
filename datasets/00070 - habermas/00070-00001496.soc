# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should not be another referendum on EU membership in the near future. The UK has already voted to leave the EU and it would be undemocratic to hold another referendum so soon after the previous one. There is also a risk that the UK would lose any progress that it has made in negotiating new trade deals. The EU is a protectionist organisation that is not in the best interests of the UK. However, it was recognised that there were some benefits to EU membership, such as free movement of people and the ability to influence EU policy. It was also recognised that there were some drawbacks to leaving the EU, such as the potential for a hard border in Ireland and the loss of influence in Europe. It was felt that the UK should continue to negotiate new trade deals with the EU and the rest of the world and that it should not rejoin the EU in the near future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the UK rejoining the EU. The main reasons for this were that the UK had already voted to leave the EU and it would be undemocratic to hold another referendum. It was also felt that the UK had already made a lot of progress in negotiating new trade deals and would lose this progress if it were to rejoin the EU. The EU was also seen as a protectionist organisation that was not in the best interests of the UK. However, it was recognised that there were some benefits to EU membership, such as free movement of people and the ability to influence EU policy. It was also recognised that there were some drawbacks to leaving the EU, such as the potential for a hard border in Ireland and the loss of influence in Europe. It was felt that the UK should continue to negotiate new trade deals with the EU and the rest of the world and that it should not rejoin the EU in the near future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group of participants were split on this question. The group was in favour of the UK rejoining the EU. The group felt that the UK had not made enough progress on trade deals and had not negotiated enough with the EU to gain the best possible deal for the UK. The group also felt that the EU had changed a lot since the UK had left and that the UK would be able to influence EU policy more and that the UK would have a bigger voice in the EU. The group was also in favour of the free movement of people within the EU and thought that the UK would benefit from this. The group was not in favour of a hard border in Ireland. However, the group recognised that there were some drawbacks to rejoining the EU, such as the UK losing control over its own laws and policies and that there were some people who would be opposed to the UK rejoining the EU.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should not apply to rejoin the EU any time in the next 5-10 years. The UK should continue to actively pursue free trade agreements, whilst maintaining a close relationship with the EU and continuing to be a close ally and friend to all of the European countries and to continue to work collaboratively together with the European countries. It is also essential that the UK continues to uphold its humanitarian obligations such as its involvement in the refugee camps in Greece and any other areas where the UK can be seen to be working in conjunction with its European neighbours.
