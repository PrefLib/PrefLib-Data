# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the government should increase spending on the NHS rather than defence. This is because the NHS is the backbone of the country and needs to be well funded in order to provide a good service to all. It is also an essential service that all people need to access. The defence is an important sector, but the government already spends a lot on this and the NHS is the clear winner in this argument.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Due to the current strain that is being put on the NHS, the government should increase spending on the NHS rather than defence. Although defence is an important aspect that we should not let slip, we need to ensure that the health and well-being of citizens in the country are also a priority. The NHS needs to be reformed and updated so that all areas of health care are dealt with appropriately, and that patients can access the healthcare that they need when they need it. In order to achieve this, the NHS needs more money and more staff. The strain is already high on the NHS, and if we do not increase spending on it, then this will only get worse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should increase spending on the NHS. There is an urgent need to increase spending on the NHS. The NHS is currently underfunded and is struggling to meet the needs of the population. There are many issues that need to be addressed in order to improve the service. These include staff shortages, low retention and staff morale, as well as poor treatment of staff. If the NHS is not funded sufficiently, then people will turn to private healthcare which will increase the costs of healthcare for the population. The NHS is the foundation of our healthcare system and should be prioritised by the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The NHS requires a lot more investment than the defence sector. Many people have found themselves in a situation where they can't get an appointment at their GP, and operations are being delayed due to the strain being put on it. The strain will only get worse if funding isn't increased, and the longer the government waits, the worse it will be. As the strain on the NHS worsens, more people will turn to private healthcare, and this will create a massive gap between the treatment available to those who can afford it, and those who can't.
