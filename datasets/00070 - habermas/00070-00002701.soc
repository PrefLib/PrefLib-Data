# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of encouraging a greater degree of national pride, but there was a strong caveat that this should not be at the expense of other people's pride, or lead to any sense of superiority.  It was felt that there is a lot to be proud of in the UK, and that the recent Olympics and Jubilee celebrations had helped to foster a sense of national pride, but that this had not been at the expense of other countries.  It was felt that it is important to celebrate the diversity of the UK, and that this is something to be proud of, but that this should not be at the expense of a sense of national pride.  It was felt that it is important to remember the history of the UK, and to celebrate the good things, but also to remember the bad things, and to learn from them.  It was felt that the recent Olympics and Jubilee celebrations had helped to foster a sense of national pride, but that this had not been at the expense of other countries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - National pride is something that can be a positive thing in some circumstances. In a time of crisis or national celebration, national pride can bring people together and unite them, but this should not be encouraged as a permanent state of being. National pride should not be used as a way of creating a sense of superiority over other nations, or to create a sense of exclusion of others. National pride should be used as a way of celebrating the diversity and successes of the nation, and not be used to encourage people to see themselves as superior to others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of a greater degree of national pride.  However, the group was very much aware of the potential for national pride to be highjacked by the right wing, and by people with racist and imperialistic views of the world.  The group was also aware of the potential for national pride to encourage people to feel superior to others, or to create a national identity that does not include everyone living in the country.  The group felt that there is a fine line between national pride and nationalism, and that it is important to be aware of this when considering whether or not to encourage a greater degree of national pride.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of encouraging a greater degree of national pride.  However, it was recognised that there is a fine line between encouraging national pride and encouraging nationalism, which can have negative consequences.  The group agreed that national pride is something that is often felt by people naturally, and that it can be very beneficial to a society.  However, it was recognised that national pride can also be used to divide people, and that it can be used to promote negative views of other countries.  The group agreed that it is important to be aware of this, and to ensure that national pride is not used in a negative way.
