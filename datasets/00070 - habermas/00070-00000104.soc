# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the use of animals for testing new chemicals is not acceptable. In special circumstances where the use of animals is necessary to save human life or to avoid large scale disasters, this use is acceptable but should be minimised. The humane treatment of animals is of paramount importance and the testing of non-essential products (i.e. cosmetics) should not be allowed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In my opinion, the use of animals in testing for new drugs, is a necessary evil, if it helps save lives. I think that it is morally wrong to cause animals pain in order to test on them, however, we must always consider the greater good of the human race, and the quality of life that we are able to enjoy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is not acceptable to use animals to test the effects of new chemicals, but only in extreme circumstances, and if it can be shown that it will ultimately lead to human life saving, or life enhancing, research. The group were of the opinion that, in order to reach this consensus view, the views of the participants in the group were significantly changed. Participant 5 did not change his/her opinion at all, but participants 1, 2 and 3 all changed their views somewhat. Participant 1 changed their view on what it is acceptable to test, participant 2 changed their view on when it is acceptable to test, and participant 3 changed their view on what is an acceptable sacrifice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Animal testing is acceptable if it is to save the lives of humans and to test products that will not harm the animals.
