# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the UK having a nuclear power industry.  The reasons for this were that nuclear power is a clean source of energy and is much better for the environment than fossil fuels.  Nuclear power may not be a clean industry because it produces radioactive waste but we need to remember that is the best option we have while we wait for green energy sources to be expanded to a level where they can consistently provide enough energy for the whole of the UK.  The group was aware of the dangers of nuclear power and the potential for accidents but felt that these were outweighed by the benefits of having a nuclear power industry.  We all agreed that the government should be working towards more green energy and that nuclear power would be phased out in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general the group was in favour of the UK having a nuclear power industry.  Nuclear power is not a clean source of energy and is much worse for the environment than fossil fuels, but we feel that it would be better for the UK to have a nuclear power industry than to use fossil fuels.  We also feel that having a nuclear power industry means that we do not rely on energy sources outside of the UK and that this can only be a good thing.  We also feel that if you took the amount of people affected by nuclear accidents in the past and compared them to the number of people that die from carbon emissions from fossil fuel emissions each year, then you find that nuclear power plants are safer.  We feel that this is balanced against the fact that we understand that the effects of radioactive waste will last for thousands of years, and we would like to see nuclear power phased out in favour of renewable energy sources.

The group was aware of the dangers of nuclear power and the potential for accidents but felt that these were outweighed by the benefits of having a nuclear power industry.  The group felt that it was important that the government was working to increase the amount of green energy in the UK and that nuclear power would be phased out in the future.  The group was aware that nuclear power was not a clean industry because it produced radioactive waste.
