# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: In general, the wearing of face masks in public should not be mandatory. However, during a pandemic, the wearing of face masks in public should be mandatory if the virus is spreading through airborne transmission. This is especially the case when government guidance is to practice physical distancing of at least 1 meter but 2 meters if possible and to minimize the number of social contacts. It should also be mandatory if physical distancing is not possible or not being practiced, including on public transport, when shopping or when staying in an indoor space with other people from outside one’s household or support bubble. These measures should be enforced when possible. It should also be mandatory for all healthcare workers and staff in care homes who interact with patients and service users to wear face masks. However, face masks should be worn in the correct way, covering both nose and mouth, should be disposed of immediately after use, and only one person should handle a face mask to avoid contamination. Regular cleaning of reusable face masks should also be ensured.
