# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, for-profit corporations should not be allowed to run state schools. The participants felt that education should be free to all and that it is a service that should be provided by the government. The participants also felt that the profit motive would not be in the best interests of the children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We feel that for profit corporations should not be allowed to run state schools. Education should be a basic right and to allow profit to be made on a basic human right is morally wrong. Education is a service provided by the state to ensure that the future generations of society are able to function and participate in society. To allow profit to be made on a service such as this goes against all principles of equality and society. Education should not be a business, it is a basic human right. We do not allow profit to be made on water, health or other basic human needs so why should education be any different.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: For-profit corporations should not be allowed to run schools.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the profit motive should not be the main driver of statutory services.  We recognise that it is often necessary to contract out certain services, such as catering or maintenance, and these should be put out to competitive tender.  The government should be responsible for setting the standards for education and the quality of teaching.  This is not to say that profit-making organisations should not be involved in education, but they should not be the main provider.  It is also important to remember that schools are not just places of learning but also social hubs for their communities.
