# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, it is not acceptable for a company to sell a facial recognition system to a country where they will be used to track political dissidents. The group did not feel that a product which would allow a government to track its citizens would be a good idea in any country, and it was particularly worried that in a country with a bad human rights record the product would be used in an oppressive way.  This was the view of all of the participants in the group.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was wary of facial recognition systems, particularly when used by government entities in politically sensitive circumstances. It is an issue of freedom of speech and expression and is only aggravated by the application of technology that can target individuals based on their expression of political opinions. It is difficult to judge whether a facial recognition system will be used in an ethically and morally questionable way, and whether it will be used to violate the human rights of suspected or alleged political dissidents. Therefore, this group of participants felt it is generally unethical to sell facial recognition systems to regimes where there is a known track record of human rights abuses, such as Iran. In such cases, it is better to err on the side of caution, particularly when the technology is to be used in politically sensitive environments. However, it is important to note that there are other ways in which facial recognition systems can be used to violate human rights, such as for racial profiling or illegal mass surveillance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We do not believe it is okay for a company to sell a facial recognition system to a country where they will be used to track political dissidents.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is not acceptable for a company to sell a facial recognition system to a country where they will be used to track political dissidents if that country has a poor record of human rights. We were quite relieved with the outcome, but when we told the others in the group, they were a bit surprised.
