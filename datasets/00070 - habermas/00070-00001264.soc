# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of keeping the monarchy. They felt that the monarchy was a tradition that made the UK unique. They also felt that the monarchy was a net positive for the UK and that it would be a shame to lose such a tradition.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the monarchy is a net positive for the UK. It is a tradition that is important to the identity of the UK. It also provides a lot of income through tourism and other means. However, the monarchy is an outdated institution that needs to change. It is important that the monarchy adapts to the changing times. It is also important that the monarchy is not wasteful and is frugal with the public money it receives. It is also important that the monarchy is not involved in politics and does not have any power in the government. The monarchy is ceremonial and should remain ceremonial.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We are all fairly undecided on the question of whether the UK should keep the monarchy.  We feel that some of the issues of the monarchy, for example the large costs associated with it, are important to consider.  However, we feel that there are also other aspects of the monarchy which are important.  For example, the monarchy helps to define the UK as a nation, and contributes to its cultural heritage.  The monarchy also helps to attract tourism to the UK, which can generate money for the economy.  So, while we do think that there are some drawbacks, we do feel that the UK should keep the monarchy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe the UK should keep the monarchy. It is a tradition that has been long standing and creates the identity of the UK. The tourism it brings in is very valuable and helps boost the economy. It is also a positive for British people to have a British monarchy and shows how great the UK is. It also symbolises the rich history and tradition of the UK. The procedure followed by the group of participants is described below. The individual participants in the group of four participants first submitted their views on the question. Then, they engaged in a deliberative discussion to come up with a consensus view.  Each participant was allowed to speak and then comment on the others' views. After that, they took a break to think about the different views that were presented. Then, they returned to the discussion with an aim of finding a consensus view. A moderator was present to facilitate the discussion.  There are advantages and disadvantages of this approach to coming up with a consensus view. One of the advantages is that it can be used for various topics, and can even be used in everyday life.  However, the disadvantage is that it is difficult to do, and requires participants to be able to discuss calmly and have
