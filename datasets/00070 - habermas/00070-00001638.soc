# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that the contributions of historically marginalised groups should be recognised and celebrated. We believe that the best way to do this is through a public holiday, which would be a great way to celebrate the diverse cultures that make up the UK. However, we do not think that this should be a separate holiday, as this would be divisive. Instead, we believe that this should be incorporated into existing holidays, such as the August bank holiday. This would be a great way to celebrate the diverse cultures that make up the UK, and would also be a good way to educate people about the history of the UK and the important role that historically marginalised groups have played in shaping our society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should have a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should have a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. The UK is a huge melting pot of different cultures, and a separate public holiday would allow us to recognise the contribution of people from all walks of life, rather than just the majority group. This would go a long way to making people from historically marginalised groups feel recognised and appreciated, and help to ensure that their contribution is not forgotten.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, I don't believe we should have separate public holidays, if we were to have more bank holidays it would have to be from contributions from people from all historical groups not just marginalised groups.
