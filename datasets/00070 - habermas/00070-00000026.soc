# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be more taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. These products are not necessities and any increase in tax would reduce their use. Also the additional revenue could be used to provide more funding for the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be more taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. The health and societal costs of these products are well-known, and by making them more expensive, people will likely smoke and drink less. This is good for individuals and society as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In principle, yes, more taxes on alcohol and cigarettes is a good thing. The issue, however, is how this can be done. How can we create more tax revenue from these items without pushing people towards homebrewed alcohol and/or black market tobacco? If we don't consider these things, we may simply be encouraging more dangerous behaviour.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the tax on cigarettes and alcohol.
