# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of building more houses to help tackle the UK’s housing shortage. However, we thought it was important to build quality homes to a high standard, which are affordable and also environmentally friendly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “I believe that we should build more houses in the UK, but I think that the government needs to ensure that these houses are built to a high quality and are affordable. I think that the government should also ensure that these houses are built on brownfield sites to ensure that we are protecting the environment and our green spaces. I think that this will be a long process and will not happen overnight, but I think that if the government ensures that they are doing their best to help tackle the housing shortage then it will be a step in the right direction.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “Yes, we should build more houses to tackle the UK’s housing shortage, but only if they are affordable and built on brownfield sites. This will help tackle the UK’s housing shortage, reduce prices, and be environmentally friendly.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should definitely build more houses to tackle the shortage as more housing will reduce the current massive demand, which would potentially make housing more affordable and reduce rent. The increase in housing availability would also make homes more affordable especially for those on a lower income.
