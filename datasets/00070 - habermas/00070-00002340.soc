# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Families with children should not be given any extra tax breaks. We already provide families with children with tax credits and child benefit and these should be sufficient. Families should be responsible for their own children and not expect the government to provide for them. The government should not be providing any tax breaks to anyone. The cost of living crisis is affecting everyone, not just families with children, and so the government should be looking at ways to reduce the cost of living for everyone, not just families with children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “Families with children should get some tax breaks. Raising children is expensive and this should be taken into account when making this decision. However, tax breaks should be means tested to ensure that families who really need them get them and that those who do not need them are not getting them. This would ensure that families with children who really need the help get it and that tax breaks are not just being given away to families with children who do not need them. Tax breaks for families with children should not be in the form of Universal Credit, which will eventually replace tax credits, as this will not provide the same level of support to families with children. We should, instead, look at bringing back child tax credits to provide more support to families with children. This would ensure that families with children get the support they need.”

The cost of living crisis is affecting everyone, not just families with children, and so the government should be looking at ways to reduce the cost of living for everyone, not just families with children. The government should also be looking at ways to increase wages and household income so that everyone can afford to get by.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of giving families with children extra tax breaks to help them get by. The group felt that families with children are already receiving benefits in the form of working tax credits and child tax credits. The group also felt that families with children should be responsible for their own children and should not rely on the government for support. However, the group did recognise that the cost of living is very high and that some families may need extra support. The group felt that any additional tax breaks should be means tested so that families that really need the support are the ones that receive it.
