# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should spend money on projects that create temporary jobs, but these need to be of a high standard. In the long run, the jobs need to be worthwhile and get the best results for the tax-payer. It is important that the people that participate in the project get the most from it, to improve their chances of gaining employment in the future. They should get training and experience from it, which can be used to gain a permanent job. There needs to be an incentive for the person taking the job to ensure they work hard and get the most from it, and not just take the job for the sake of the money.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In principle, yes the government should spend money on projects that create temporary jobs. The issue, however, is how this can be done most effectively. If a person is offered a temporary job which will only last a month, they may not see the benefit of taking the job, especially if it means they will have to wait a month before they can get back on benefits. If the time that people spend in temporary jobs is made to be longer, say three months, this will give them the opportunity to earn more money. It will also mean that they have more time to try and find a permanent job and even set up their own business. The job would have to be given to the right people for the right reasons. This means that if a person has not been looking for work, they should not be given the opportunity to take a temporary job. Also, people must not see these jobs as a way of getting out of having to look for a permanent job. To make this project a success, a budget needs to be allocated to it and a time scale put in place for its completion. A temporary job could then be a good tool to help the economy and also people themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should spend money on projects that create temporary jobs, but only when the long-term benefits for both the economy and society are clearly and measurable beneficial.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the idea of the government creating temporary jobs is a good one, and could create opportunities for people to gain experience and be able to demonstrate their skills in order to help them in their search for work. However, the government should not use this as an excuse to avoid creating projects that create permanent jobs, as the latter will have a more lasting impact.
