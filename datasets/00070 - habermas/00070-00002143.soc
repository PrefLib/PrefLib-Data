# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Adults who want to marry should be allowed to. It is their decision and their life and we cannot tell people they should not be allowed to be married. There may be a few reasons why people shouldn't be allowed to get married such as a history of violence but even with those people there should be processes in place to help them to get married if they truly believe they are ready. Conclusions: After reviewing the information presented, I have concluded that there are certain circumstances in which I feel marriage between adults is permissible. However, the connotations of what is 'permissible' and what is 'allowable' in our society today are not always the same.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Adults who want to marry should generally be allowed to unless there are some significant factors which deem them unfit to be married. There is no reason to forbid someone from getting married. In our society today there are no acceptable reasons to deny someone the opportunity to marry so long as it is consensual and not forcing someone into marriage. In the rare cases where there are some factors which would deem someone unfit, it is advisable to seek help from various organizations and professionals to ensure that it is a viable situation. In cases where it is accepted but there is concern it is advisable to get marriage counseling and be reassessed from time to time.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Adults who want to marry should be allowed to. The decision to get married is theirs alone and we should not interfere. There may be a few reasons why people shouldn't be allowed to get married such as a history of violence but even with those people there should be processes in place to help them to get married if they truly believe they are ready.
