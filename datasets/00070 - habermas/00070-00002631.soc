# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - yes i think the prisons are full and people in prison dont seem to come out very changed and continue to commit crimes once they get back out . I think we need to work towards  prevention  and education as a  model , starting in schools and working with youths to change their ways from a younger age as a way of preventing them from getting in with the wrong crowds and ending up committing crimes at an older age . 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, we should be. The prison system, and the criminal justice system in general, are both deeply flawed constructs in need of significant systemic and institutional reform. There are too many people in prison for reasonably harmless behaviours, most of which are linked to ingrained socio-economic issues in the UK. Higher numbers of incarcerated peoples should be assisted through social programs such as rehabilitation to be re-integrated into society, and supported in the process. Additionally, there should be more funding and systems introduced in relation to reducing the likelihood of following a path to illegal activities. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes. The focus of the criminal justice system should be rehabilitation, not pure punishment. Society also needs to put effort into solving the problems present which push people into crime in the first place.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - If people are not a danger to society when released and have been or can be rehabilitated then I don't think prison is the answer for them. However they would need to successfully be monitored to avoid re-offending. If this is a viable option then I think it would help reduce costs associated to housing prisoners which could be put towards educating/deterring potential offenders in the first place and hopefully reduce the need of prison for a lot of people.
