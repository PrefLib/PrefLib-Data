# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of banning the smoking of cigarettes in public places. Most people felt that passive smoking should be avoided. Some people thought that in places where smoking was already banned, for example in bars and restaurants, that smoking in public outdoor spaces should be allowed if the smoking is taking place in a designated area away from other people. However, if the question was asked as to whether or not we should ban the smoking of cigarettes in all public places, then all people agreed that this should be the case, in particular to protect children and vulnerable people from exposure to passive smoking.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The majority of participants thought that in general the smoking of cigarettes in public places should be banned, with the exception of areas designated for smokers only. Some participants thought that this should only be the case if smoking was already banned indoors, so that people had the choice of where to smoke. However, the group in general felt that smoking in public places should be banned even if smoking was still allowed indoors. This is because smoking in public places can expose others to passive smoking, and in particular children and the elderly should not have to be exposed to this, especially in a public place. In my experience of teaching students the skill of critical thinking, I think that the consensus building activity was useful in developing students' critical thinking skills. I felt that the activity worked well with the topics we were discussing, and that the students did not have any difficulty completing the task. The activity was beneficial in terms of developing students' ability to form and support a group opinion, and in improving their ability to compromise and negotiate. I also think that the activity would work well with a variety of different topics, for example it would work very well in terms of getting students to work together to come up with a consensus opinion on questions related to a group project, such as
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a ban on smoking in public places. Smoking should be allowed in designated areas that are well-separated from the rest of the public. These designated areas should be clearly marked. Signage should be present to inform the public of where they can and cannot smoke. This would allow people to smoke if they wish to, but would also allow non-smokers to avoid being in the vicinity of cigarettes if they so wish.
