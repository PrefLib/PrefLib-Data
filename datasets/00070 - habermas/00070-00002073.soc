# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of eating meat. The group felt that it is appropriate to eat meat, however, the way in which the meat is produced and the amount of meat consumed needs to be reduced. The group felt that the way in which the meat is produced needs to be more sustainable and that the animals should be treated in a more humane way. The group felt that there is a need to reduce the amount of meat consumed, however, the group did not feel that it was appropriate to ban the consumption of meat completely. The group felt that it is important to have a balanced diet and that it is fine to eat meat as part of that diet. The group felt that it is important to have meat free days to help reduce the amount of meat consumed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Meat is an important part of a healthy and balanced diet. Humans have evolved to eat meat and it is a significant source of protein, minerals and vitamins. Animals are also a part of the food chain and as predators we must eat to survive. I believe that it is perfectly appropriate to eat meat. However, in modern times, we must be conscious of sustainability and animal welfare. Meat consumption is increasing and is negatively impacting on the environment. To help prevent this, we must work together to ensure that meat is sustainably produced. Animals must be raised in a humane way, allowed to roam free and not be kept in cages. We must do what we can to ensure that we are not depleting the earth of its resources.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Humans have evolved to eat meat and we should be allowed to continue to do so. However, we should also try to reduce the amount of meat we eat in order to help the climate. This can be done by having more meat free days, more vegetarian options in supermarkets and more education on the climate impacts of eating meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is fine to eat meat, but only if it is raised and slaughtered in a humane way. You can't just take a cow from the fields and kill it, you need to give it a happy life first.
