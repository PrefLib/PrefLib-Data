# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The current system of student loans is unfair to those who come from poorer backgrounds, and therefore we would like to see the system changed to a model where the level of tuition fees is based on income, so that those from poorer backgrounds pay less, and those from wealthier backgrounds pay more. In addition, we would like to see the repayment threshold for student loans increased to £30k, and the repayment period increased to 30 years.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of abolishing student tuition fees. The group felt that the idea of abolishing tuition fees would lead to a situation where the quality of education would be compromised. The group also felt that the idea of abolishing tuition fees would lead to a situation where only the wealthy would be able to access the best quality education. The group felt that there should be a system of student loans and grants in place, which would allow the best students to access the best quality education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Abolishing tuition fees is a step in the right direction, however we do not think it is a sufficient step. The current system has caused a generation of students to be burdened with debt and it has led to a stratification of universities, with the best universities being able to charge the highest fees. We believe that a system of subsidies is necessary, in which the government supports those from lower income households, so that they can afford to study at university. We also believe that the government should support universities to ensure that they are able to offer high quality education to students.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of abolishing student tuition fees. However, we recognised that student loans are undesirable and that they discourage poorer individuals from applying for student places in further education. We agreed that we should wish to encourage everybody to learn to the highest level of their ability. We also recognised that some professions such as nursing and teaching are in high need of applicants and that student fees should be reduced or abolished for these professions. We did not agree that we should abolish tuition fees, but rather re-design the system to provide benefits based on the income of students/families/households.
