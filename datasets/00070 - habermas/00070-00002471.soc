# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is strong evidence to suggest that the former President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, is not a 'good man'. This is evidenced by his questionable moral responses to issues that affect people in many different ways. From what the group knows of the former President, it would seem that he is a man that does harm to others in many different ways, rather than do them good. This could be on a personal level as an individual or in terms of his political policies and practices. It is the consensus view of this group that the former President of the United States of America is not a 'good man'.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the conclusion that Donald Trump is not a good man. We have come to this conclusion because we have seen that he has lied many times about important things such as the corona virus. We have also seen that he has been very disrespectful to people such as women and minorities. We have also seen that he has treated people like objects and used them to get what he wants. We have also seen that he has been very inconsiderate to others and their feelings.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - President Trump is not a good man. The evidence we have seen from media outlets as well as from staff and ex-staff of his, it would seem that President Trump has questionable practices and moral responses to issues where one would want a powerful person to have different views. In some cases, his views resonate with many people, but popularity does not mean one is 'good' or right. If the definition of being a 'good' person is that you do not cause harm to others but indeed do them good; materially, emotionally or physically, then from what we know of President Trump he has done harm to people in many different ways. This could be on a personal level as an individual or in terms of his political policies and practices. We caveat all our views of someone we have no direct personal experience of him and therefore desire to remain open-minded because we're aware of how the press can skew opinions. We also feel that not having direct experience of someone does not mean one cannot make a judgement on their morality.
