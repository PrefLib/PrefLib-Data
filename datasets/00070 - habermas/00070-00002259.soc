# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, we have a responsibility to protect the environment for the benefit of future generations. As human beings we have to live in an environment, and it is therefore in our best interest to keep that environment healthy and habitable. We have seen and are seeing the effects of what our actions have done to the environment and are increasingly seeing the damage it does to our own health. While it is true that big changes must be made to protect the environment for the future, we also need to consider that, as individuals, we can all make small changes to how we live to help protect it. If everyone does their bit, the changes will add up to make a big difference. It is not just about being more environmentally friendly for future generations but also for us, the present generation, and the environment we live in now. We have a responsibility to protect the environment for the benefit of future generations. The facilitators were pleased that the group of participants were able to reach a consensus. They considered that the final statement was well thought out, took into account various views, and presented a balanced view.

It is not just about being more environmentally friendly for future generations but also for us, the present generation, and the environment we live in now. We should all be prepared to do our bit, no matter how small and lots of small actions can result in significant changes. Surely we all want a good environment for our children and our children's children. Too much damage has been done already and we should set to work before it is too late. The world is a beautiful place and should not be spoilt by irresponsible and thoughtless actions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, we have a responsibility to protect the environment for the benefit of future generations.  As human beings, we have to live in an environment and so it is in our best interest to keep that environment healthy and habitable. We have seen and are seeing the effects of what our actions have done to the environment and are increasingly seeing the damage it does to our own health.  While it is true that big changes must be made to protect the environment for the future, we also need to consider that, as individuals, we can all make small changes to how we live to help protect it.  If everyone does their bit, the changes will add up to make a big difference.  It is not just about being more environmentally friendly for future generations, but also for us, the present generation, and the environment we live in now. This project was designed by Genevieve Morash, Genevieve Ferguson and Alicia Berrie.
