# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a presumption against the use of stop and search powers by the police. However, if the police have a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in drug dealing and if this is based on sufficient information, then they should be allowed to stop and search that person. The police must have a clear policy on the use of stop and search powers and this must be subject to independent review.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In principle, the police should be allowed to stop and search people for drugs if they are in an area known for drug dealing. However, this should be subject to the following conditions: - There must be a reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in drug dealing. - The police must have sufficient information to justify this suspicion. - The police must have a clear policy on the use of stop and search powers and this must be subject to independent review. - The policy should be approved by a body that represents local communities, those most likely to be targeted. - Police officers must receive training in the use of stop and search powers - Data about who is stopped and searched should be collected and analysed for any evidence of bias.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We generally agree with the draft consensus statement, but believe that it should be even stronger, saying that in principle the police should not be allowed to stop and search people for drugs, if they are in an area known for drug dealing, unless there is a  high degree of suspicion that the person they are stopping is involved in drug dealing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In principle, the police should be allowed to stop and search people for drugs if they are in an area known for drug dealing. However, this should be subject to the following conditions: - There must be a reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in drug dealing. - The police must have sufficient information to justify this suspicion. - The police must have a clear policy on the use of stop and search powers and this must be subject to independent review. - The police must be trained in the use of stop and search powers and there should be an independent review of stop and search incidents to ensure that they are being applied fairly. - The public should be made fully aware of the stop and search policy.
