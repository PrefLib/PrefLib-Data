# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “I believe we should raise airline taxes. This would offset an individual traveller's carbon footprint. The taxes could then be used in initiatives to offset a global carbon footprint in areas affected most by climate change. Airline travel causes a lot of CO2 emissions and hence contributes to climate change. Most short-haul airline travel is fairly unnecessary and could easily be replaced by (less emissions intense) train or high speed train travel. Raising airline taxes would make it more expensive to travel and only absolutely necessary airline travel would happen. On the other side it would just mostly impact poorer people more, as wealthy people can still afford to travel and even a higher tax would not deter them.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should not raise airline taxes. The aviation industry has had a very tough year, and people are under a lot of financial pressure at the moment. Increasing airline taxes will just make it more expensive for people to travel, and this is not fair. We do think, however, that it is important to make the aviation industry aware of the damage that it is causing to the climate. We think that it should be made compulsory for airlines to offset their carbon footprint by planting trees or contributing to a global fund to help those who are suffering most from the effects of climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of raising airline taxes. This would reduce the number of flights, and hence reduce the amount of CO2 emitted. However, we also recognised that this would disproportionately impact the poorest in society, as they would be less likely to be able to afford to travel. We therefore suggested that the tax should be raised, but that the revenue should be used to subsidise the cost of flights for the poorest in society. This would ensure that the poorest in society are still able to travel, but that the overall number of flights is reduced, and hence the amount of CO2 emitted is reduced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of raising airline taxes, but only if the tax revenue was used to invest in green energy initiatives, such as wind farms and solar panels, or to support developing countries in their transition to green energy. The group was also in favour of using the tax revenue to improve public transport in the UK, so that people could travel more easily by train.
