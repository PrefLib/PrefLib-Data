# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be more effort put into encouraging people to vote as this would lead to a better understanding of the people by their representatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - More effort should be put into encouraging people to vote. Voting is the process through which representatives governing the public are elected. The entire system of democratic voting works on the principle of large numbers voting for the representatives to prevent cheating and underhanded methods to gain an advantage. Since the representatives are literally enforcing and changing laws, their election should have more attention and importance given to it. Therefore, there is a need for an extra effort in making more people to vote. Being reluctant to vote is also a human right because one may feel that noone seems to be fit enough to represent her. However, if the whole eligible population were to vote then the outcome of the vote will more accurately represent the consensus of the population. If there is a lack of encouragement to vote, people may abstain and the outcome may turn out to not support the majority view but that of the population that voted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People have the right to be apathetic about voting, and no effort should be made to make people vote if they do not want to. However, encouraging people to vote is an important part of making sure that the outcome of an election represents the views of all the people who are eligible to vote, not just the people who are actively engaged.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Voting is the method through which people elect their representatives who govern the state. In a democracy, the government is supposed to rule by the will of the people. In order to ensure this is true, it is imperative that a maximum number of people vote in elections. Therefore, it is important that more effort is put into encouraging people to vote.”
