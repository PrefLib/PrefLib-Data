# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that prisons can be better utilised and that the number of people in prison can be reduced in the UK. While in some cases, incarceration is necessary, it should not be the only option available to society in the majority of cases. There are many factors that contribute to crime and many of these factors, such as mental health, poverty, and abuse, are not addressed adequately within prisons. We would like to see more emphasis placed on reform within prisons to help people address the causes of their behaviour and re-enter society without the need to re-offend.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison by targeting those who have not committed violent crimes and by rehabilitating those who have.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison. This is because prisons are not an effective way of reducing crime and there are better ways of dealing with offenders.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the prison population should be reduced. There are many people in prison who are not a danger to society and should be released. The focus of prison should be rehabilitation, not punishment. There are many ways to reduce the prison population, including reducing poverty and improving rehabilitation. However, we should not be releasing violent offenders. Prison should be a last resort for the most dangerous criminals, and we should focus on helping offenders to get their life back on track.
