# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that a code of conduct is necessary for social media. Social media companies have a responsibility to their users to provide a safe environment, and should be held accountable if they fail to do so. This code of conduct should be written by the social media companies themselves, and should be enforceable by an independent body, perhaps an ombudsman. This code of conduct should be made public and easily accessible, and should be written in plain language. It should clearly define what is and is not acceptable, and what the consequences of violating the code of conduct are. This code of conduct should be reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of having some form of code of conduct for social media. The group was in favour of this as they felt that it would help to protect users and make social media platforms safer. The group did not think that the code of conduct should be imposed by the government, as they felt that the government would not be the best placed to regulate social media. The group felt that social media companies should be responsible for regulating their own platforms and the conduct of their users. The group also felt that social media companies should have their own guidelines for conduct on their services, and that these companies are best placed to sanction users that break their rules.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Social media has become an integral part of modern life, and while it can be a force for good it can also be a platform for the spread of hate and misinformation. Each social media company should have their own guidelines for conduct on their services, and are best placed to sanction user's that break their rules. However it is clear that these companies are slow to improve or tighten safeguards, and tend to only take action after a public outcry or the threat of regulation. On this basis it may be expedient to appoint regulators to oversee the conduct of social media companies themselves, rather than the users, and for the social media companies to be responsible for the behaviour of users on their services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be an official code of conduct for social media. This is to ensure that social media is a safe place for all users and that there is a clear guideline for acceptable behavior. Social media is a useful tool for communication and the sharing of information. It is also a place for people to express their opinions and thoughts. This can be positive, however it can also be negative. There have been many cases of people using social media to bully, harass and spread hate speech. This is a serious problem and needs to be addressed. A code of conduct would be a good way to address this problem. It would provide a guideline for what is acceptable and what is not. It would also provide consequences for those who violate the guidelines. This would hopefully create a safe place for all users.
