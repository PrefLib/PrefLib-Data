# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Elected officials should have a term limit for their respected offices as this helps to put more pressure on them and also ensure the people are given another chance to elect another person if they are not contented with the present elected officials
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the idea of term limits for elected officials makes a lot of sense and would create a more democratic society. This would be particularly beneficial in less democratic nations as this would allow for a greater turnover of government officials and would result in less corruption as power is less concentrated. However, it is also important to consider the situation in individual nations. In a developed democracy such as the UK, term limits would be less beneficial as this would remove some of the accountability that politicians currently face. A lack of term limits could lead to the possibility that more accountability and scrutiny is placed upon those in power and thus reduce corruption. In the current UK political climate, it may be better to introduce stricter laws on lobbying and better transparency to avoid the need for term limits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be term limits for elected officials as it can increase the quality of candidates and increase the competition for elections.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People in power do not need term limits, but their ideas and solutions to problems do need to keep evolving and developing. This is not necessarily something that term limits will help to achieve. The people of any given country will always be able to vote in someone new to take over if they wish.
