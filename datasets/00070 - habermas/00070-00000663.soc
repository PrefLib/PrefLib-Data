# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of this idea. However, it is very important to ensure that the system is not open to abuse.  The system would also have to be set up in such a way that the reward would be given only after the problem is solved and not before.  It would be good to add why the group was in favour as the statement currently doesn't elaborate.  The solution to problems like climate change could take hundreds of years, so the reward could potentially be required before the problem is solved.  I agree with this but would also add that there would need to be stringent measures in place to ensure the integrity of those wishing to partake as presumably there would be a lot of people/groups.  It is very ambiguous and there would need to be a very structured and well thought out process in place.  This statement agrees very closely with my original statement but offers a way of potentially solving how the money could be distributed fairly.  It's well written and gives balance and foresight.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of this idea. However, it is very important to ensure that the system is not open to abuse.  The system would also have to be set up in such a way that the reward would be given only after the problem is solved and not before.  The problem could be something like climate change, for example.
