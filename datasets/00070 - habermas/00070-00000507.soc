# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the participants were opposed to national service in any form. However, if there was to be a requirement for a period of national service it should be available to all age groups and levels of education and it should not be compulsory. The participants considered that people in all age groups have different skills and contributions to make. It would be wrong to target a specific group for national service. The participants further considered that making it compulsory for students would discourage some young people from going to university and this could have negative consequences for them and for the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the decision that students should be encouraged to take a year of national service after their higher education. In the case of the participants in this study, they all agreed that this year of service should be voluntary, though encouraged. The reasoning behind this was that although the participants had originally had mixed opinions, it was the view of all of them that young people with a higher education should be given the opportunity to choose for themselves, whether to contribute to their country, or to move on to the next stage of their lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - All school leavers (at 16, 18 or older) should be obliged to do a minimum of two years national service. This would divert many people from considering attending university as they would have experienced real-world work and would have learned the value of their own endeavours toward a common goal. Only the most intelligent, academic minds should ven consider further education, as people tend to thrive more if they decide on a skill or trade and work from 16 or 18 toward the development of the neccessary skills.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People with higher education should be encouraged to do national service, rather than being obliged to do it. This is because their skills and expertise are often already beneficial to society and it would be unfair to force them to work in a role that would not make use of these. Also, if the state has paid for the higher education, there is a sense that the student should be obliged to do the national service.  However, if the higher education has been paid for privately, or the person's skills would be wasted in the national service, they should not be obliged to do it.
