# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Public transport should be free to use as it is a vital service for many people, especially those on lower incomes. The costs of running public transport would be subsidised by the government, as it is currently. However, there would be a need to raise taxes in order to pay for this service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the idea of making public transport free is a good one. However, the costs associated with providing the service, which would be enormous, would have to be met from somewhere and that is where the problem would start. The government would need to raise taxes, at either national or local levels, to pay for this or the government would need to borrow more to pay for it which would increase the national debt. It wouldn't be sustainable in the long term although they could do something like make short term concessions for some income groups so that it is subsidised rather than completely free.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Public transport should be free. However, we recognise that there are costs involved in providing public transport, and that it is impractical to make it completely free. We therefore suggest that a system of subsidies be put in place to reduce the costs of public transport for low income groups.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Public transport should be free. However, the costs of providing the service would need to be covered by some means. The government could provide the service free of charge, but this would mean raising taxes to pay for it. The government could also provide the service free of charge and cover the costs by borrowing more money. This would increase the national debt. If public transport was provided free of charge, it would be very popular, and more people would use it. The costs of providing the service would be high, so it would be very difficult to make it free.
