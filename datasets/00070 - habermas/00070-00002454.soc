# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We do not believe it is possible to completely eradicate bullying in schools, however, it is possible to reduce it significantly. In order to do this, schools must implement a reporting system where students can anonymously report bullying, and also ensure that students are educated on the topic of bullying. Schools should also create an environment where students feel safe to speak up about bullying and know that they will be listened to. It is also important that schools work closely with parents to ensure that the values that are being taught in school are also being taught at home.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We feel that bullying can be reduced in schools but not completely eradicated. Children are still growing and learning about the world. They will make mistakes and be unkind to each other at times. However, we feel that a lot of bullying can be prevented by creating a culture of inclusion in schools. Teachers and pupils need to be educated about bullying and the impact it can have on a person. There needs to be a system in place where pupils can report bullying anonymously and be confident that it will be dealt with. If pupils know that they can speak up about bullying without fear of repercussions then this will help to reduce bullying in schools. It is also important to educate pupils on why people bully. It is often a case of insecurity and a need to feel superior. If pupils understand this then they will be less likely to bully and more likely to stand up for a pupil who is being bullied.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that bullying in schools is a difficult problem to solve. We all feel that it is possible to reduce bullying in schools, but not completely eradicate it. This is because children are impressionable and will often follow the behaviour of those around them, whether that is their parents, friends or siblings. We also feel that it is difficult to monitor children all of the time, and bullying can happen when they are out of sight. However, we feel that bullying can be reduced by implementing a reporting system, where students can anonymously report bullying. This will allow the school to be aware of any bullying that is happening and take the necessary steps to stop it. We also feel that it is important to educate students on the topic of bullying, and to create an environment where pupils feel safe to speak up.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although it is possible to reduce bullying in schools, it is not possible to eradicate it completely. Bullying is a complex issue and is caused by a variety of factors, including the home environment, the school environment, and the wider social environment. Therefore, it is very difficult to create a school environment where bullying is completely eradicated. The best way to reduce bullying is to educate students about the harms of bullying, to create a culture of inclusivity in the school, and to have a clear policy on bullying, with clear consequences for those who bully. It is also important that students feel safe to report bullying when it occurs. However, it is not possible to monitor students all the time, and some bullying will inevitably occur when students are out of sight. Therefore, it is not possible to eradicate bullying completely.
