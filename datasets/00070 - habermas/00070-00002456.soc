# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that increasing taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks would be detrimental to the economy and would not have the desired effect of reducing sugar consumption. We believe that the issue of obesity is more complex than just sugar consumption and that increasing taxes would not be an effective way of dealing with the issue. We believe that the government should invest in educating people on the health risks of sugar consumption and obesity. We also believe that the government should invest in making healthy food more affordable and accessible to people. We believe that the government should also invest in making exercise more accessible to people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should not increase the tax on sugar-sweetened drinks. Sugar-sweetened drinks are already subject to tax to deter excessive consumption and promote healthier life choices. On the other hand the tax disproportionally impacts lower health individuals. I feel like there are other much more pressing issues rather than ther tax on sugar sweetended drinks in the current environment. We should not distort the market by increasing taxes which will create inefficiencies in the market by increasing deadweight loss. The market will be distorted by the application of the tax which will be inconvenient for producers and consumers. Consumers who use drinks in moderation will be unfairly punished for their decisions which is unfair. Consumers may actually switch to a less healthy alternative if the tax is imposed, which could actually worsen the issue that the tax aims to solve by reducing sugary drink consumption. Realistically any increase in tax will be a problem economically and should be avoided if possible. This could also have negative implications for the economy in terms of employment and inward investment into the market with regards to drinks.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of increasing taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks. The group felt that it was unfair to increase taxes on the consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks as it would punish people who consume these drinks in moderation. The group also felt that the tax would not be effective in reducing the consumption of sugary drinks as people would switch to alternative unhealthy drinks. The group felt that the tax would also be economically inefficient as it would create deadweight loss in the market and distort the market. The group felt that it would be more effective to increase the price of sugary drinks by increasing the costs of production rather than by increasing taxes on consumption. This would also be more economically efficient as it would not distort the market.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we should not increase taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks. Taxes are already in place on sugar-sweetened drinks and increasing them would not solve the obesity problem. The tax would also disproportionally impact lower health individuals and could lead to them switching to an even less healthy alternative. The tax would also distort the market, creating inefficiencies in the market by increasing deadweight loss. The tax would also unfairly punish consumers who use drinks in moderation. The tax would also have negative implications for the economy in terms of employment and inward investment into the market with regards to drinks. The tax would also not be ring fenced for a purpose, which would make it easier to swallow. The tax would also not solve the obesity problem.
