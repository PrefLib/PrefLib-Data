# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - When it comes to testing the safety of new chemicals, the safety of the public must be the first priority. However, this does not mean that animal testing should be the first step in ensuring this safety. Testing on animals should only be used if all other alternatives have been exhausted, and if it is the only way to ensure that the public will be safe. If a chemical is safe for humans, it is not necessarily safe for animals, and if a chemical is deemed safe for animals, it is not necessarily safe for humans. We need to ensure that any testing is done in the most ethical way possible, and that the safety of the animals is considered. We should look for alternatives to animal testing, such as using human cells. The safety of animals is important, as is the safety of humans. We should always ensure that the animals involved in testing are well looked after and that their suffering is kept to a minimum.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the safety of the public must be the first priority when it comes to releasing new chemicals into the world. This means that some level of animal testing is necessary to ensure this safety. However, testing on animals should be the last resort, and should only be used if there is no other alternative. It is also important to consider the environmental impact of chemicals that are released into the world, even if they are safe for humans.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There is a degree of disagreement in this group about whether animal testing should be permitted at all. However, in general the safety of the public must be the first priority when it comes to releasing new chemicals into the world. This means that some level of animal testing is necessary to ensure this safety. However, testing on animals should be the last resort, and should only be used if there is no other alternative. Additionally, we should take care to ensure that new chemicals do not have negative effects on the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the safety of the public must be the first priority when it comes to releasing new chemicals into the world. This means that some level of animal testing is necessary to ensure this safety. However, testing on animals should be the last resort, and should only be used if there is no other alternative.
