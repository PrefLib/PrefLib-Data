# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of using artificial intelligence to make important decisions. This is because AI is impartial, efficient and has access to a lot of information. However, it is important to remember that AI is not perfect and therefore it is important to check the decisions made by AI.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, the group has decided that artificial intelligence can be used to make important decisions, however, we believe that humans should have the final say in all important decisions. We have come to this conclusion because we believe that humans have the ability to understand the context of a situation, whereas artificial intelligence is only able to refer to past decisions. We also believe that humans have the ability to make decisions based on emotion, whereas artificial intelligence is unable to do this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While the use of AI is an effective tool to have as an aid to making important decisions, we do not believe that this tool is completely reliable. We believe that AI is unable to make a decision based on all the facts, as a human can, as AI does not have the full emotional range, and context, which a human has. It cannot understand the nuances of each individual situation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is okay to use artificial intelligence to make important decisions, but you should only use it to advise, and never completely replace human decision making.
