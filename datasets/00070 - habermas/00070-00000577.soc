# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A strong defence force is important for any country, not just the UK. It is important to keep a strong defence force as it will be able to protect us from external threats, even if we try to avoid conflicts, there are always people who will try to cause problems. We need to be prepared to deal with such threats. Although some may think that the defence budget should be reduced in order to spend more money on other areas of the economy, it is vital to spend money on the defence budget in order to keep our country and people safe.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although a strong defence force is important, there are other areas in the UK that require more attention at present. There needs to be more money and infrastructure put in place to save our failing healthcare system for example, and this should be the priority.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of maintaining a strong defence force in the UK. Most people believed that this is necessary to protect our interests abroad, especially in places where the UK has a presence such as Afghanistan, and to protect us from terrorism. There were some participants that felt that this is a large expense for the government to pay, especially when there are other problems such as the health care system that needs more investment. However, it was generally agreed that defence is an important priority. A secondary opinion discussed was that it was important to maintain a strong defence force because it was important to maintain the UK's status in the world. As a world leader, it is important to maintain a strong defence force to send a message that the UK should not be underestimated. A third opinion discussed was that defence is important to prevent invasion and anarchy from terrorist groups.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the conclusion that the UK does not need to spend more money on its defense force but that it is important to maintain the current funding that is spent on the force to ensure that our forces are trained well enough to be able to act in times of need. The UK's involvement in Ukraine has shown that the training received by our troops is of a high standard. It is important to be seen to be well equipped, so that we do not become a target.
