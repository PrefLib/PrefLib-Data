# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Yes, we feel that access to NHS records should be more restricted. This is to prevent the possibility of patient data getting into the wrong hands and also to prevent the possibility of insurance companies gaining access to patient data. This would be unfair on the public as it could lead to higher insurance premiums for those with pre-existing conditions. It would also be unfair on those who have a clean bill of health as they would be paying higher premiums for no reason. The NHS should also consider using anonymous data for research purposes as this would protect patient confidentiality and allow for more effective research to take place. The group felt that the current system is not working as it should be and needs to be tightened up to prevent privacy breaches and to protect patient confidentiality. The group also felt that the NHS should consider using anonymous data for research purposes as this would protect patient confidentiality and allow for more effective research to take place.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe the laws about who can have access to NHS records should be tightened up because only people who are allowed to see this information should be able to access it. If everyone can access these records, it would cause a lot of problems for people’s privacy and also some people may use it for the wrong reasons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “I feel that we should tighten up the laws about who can have access to NHS records. Data breaches of these records could be catastrophic. This data needs to be managed in a way that ensures confidentiality, especially as medical information is so personal and vulnerable to attacks. We need to ensure that these records are stored securely and only used for the intended purpose. The health service is increasingly moving towards digital records, which makes this data even more susceptible to being leaked or hacked. We must ensure that the data is kept secure and is only used by approved and authorised people.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Access to NHS records should be more tightly controlled. The health service needs to improve its security and make it easier for patients to understand who has access to their records and why. It should also be made easier for patients to control access to their records. However, it is also important that access is not too tightly controlled as this could prevent important medical research and could prevent doctors from having access to the information they need to treat patients properly.”
