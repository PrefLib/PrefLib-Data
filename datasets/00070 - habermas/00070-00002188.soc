# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Immigration is a net positive for a country’s economy. It brings in money for the economy at it means there will be a need for more consumption of goods which will boost the economy. It has a positive impact on the country’s economy as the immigrants add value to the country financially and strenthwise. It also fills up job vacancies which in turn provide more people with money that will be spent on goods and imports in the country, therefore boosting economy. However, it is important to note that immigration also has negative effects on the economy. It increases the costs in NHS costs, welfare payments, inflationary pressures which outweigh any positive effect on the economy. Therefore, it is important to ensure that immigration is controlled and that the immigrants who come into the country are vetted properly to ensure that they are not a threat to the economy or the country. This is why there should be a limit on the number of immigrants that are allowed into a country each year. There should also be a limit on the number of immigrants that are allowed to enter a country from each country. This will ensure that there is a balance between the positive and negative effects of immigration on a country’s economy.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although immigrants fill important jobs that would otherwise be unfilled, and contribute to the economy through taxes and the consumption of goods, this is outweighed by the cost of increased welfare and healthcare spending.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It was agreed that the overall positive economic effects of immigration outweigh the negatives. Immigration contributes to economic growth by increasing the size of the labour force, filling both high and low skill gaps. Immigrants often take on jobs that are essential to the economy such as in agriculture, hospitality and healthcare. Immigrants are also consumers which stimulates the economy and local business. It was also agreed that if immigration brings in money for the economy at it means there will be a need for more consumption of goods which will boost the economy.

The extra expense in NHS costs, welfare payments, and inflationary pressures are outweighed by the positive effect on the economy. Immigrants fill up job vacancies which in turn provide more people with money that will be spent on goods and imports in the country, therefore boosting the economy.
