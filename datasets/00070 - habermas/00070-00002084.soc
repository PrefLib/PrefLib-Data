# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK government should not make all the decisions regarding what is taught in school, because collectively they do not have the up to date experience about subjects and it is a significant overreach of power. Education unions and teachers have more of an idea of what pupils need to learn for todays university courses and apprenticeships. The government could advise that certain things should be included but that should be as far as it should go.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should have a certain level of involvement regarding what is taught in schools. This should be more of a guideline than a ruling as it will take into account modern day requirements, but there should also be a level of input from schools, teachers and parents so that there is a balance between what the government wants and what the students need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, the UK government should not make all the decisions regarding what is taught in school. There should be some sort of national curriculum, but the government should not decide what should and shouldn't be taught in schools as this can lead to certain important things being left out. The government could advise that certain things should be included but that should be as far as it should go. Education unions and teachers have more of an idea of what pupils need to learn for todays university courses and apprenticeships.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, the UK government should not make all the decisions regarding what is taught in school. The government would not act fairly and would not have the best interests of the public in their minds. In an ideal scenario there would be a group of separate qualified people making the decisions which the government cannot interfere with.
