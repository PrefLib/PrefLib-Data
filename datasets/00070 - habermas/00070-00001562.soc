# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that the UK should be more open and accepting of asylum seekers. The UK has a great track record of helping out in times of trouble and distress, and the introduction of new people from other places would benefit the UK culturally. There is much to be learned from the people that we might see as very different from ourselves, but these people have the same basic human rights as anyone else and deserve the same consideration and help. The UK should continue to do what it has always done, and stand for the rights of the oppressed, the underprivileged and the downtrodden.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should make it easier for people to enter the UK as asylum seekers, because no life is more important than another.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the UK should change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country.  However, the UK should also be prepared to support the refugees and asylum seekers that are entering the country, and provide them with a good standard of living, accommodation and support.  This may be costly for the country, but is necessary to support these people and help them integrate into society.  It is also important to ensure that people who enter the country under the asylum seeking policy do not become a burden on society and the economy.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that people entering the country under this policy have the skills and education to contribute to society and the economy.  In this way, the UK will benefit from the asylum seeking policy.
