# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. This is because it is discriminatory and therefore it is not fair.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. It is unethical to charge different prices to different people. It is not fair to charge more to certain people, especially if they are young or have limited funds. It is also not fair to charge more to women. We also debated the different scenarios, such as when products are designed for different sexes - however we believe that there are alternatives to designing the product differently, and therefore it was decided that different prices should not be charged.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. Charging different prices to different people is discriminatory and unethical and may lead to other forms of discrimination. It is not fair to charge more to certain people, especially if they are young and do not have a lot of money. It is also not fair to charge more to women, as this is sexist and could lead to a gender pay gap.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is morally unacceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. It is unfair to those who end up being charged more, particularly if they don't have a lot of money. It is also unfair to charge the same for a product that two people want equally differently, just because one person is more vulnerable than the other. Other questions being discussed in the public forum: Is it morally acceptable to present multiple versions of the same product, with prices ranging from £1 to £50, aimed at different customer categories?
