# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of improving public transport in urban areas. This is because it would reduce congestion, reduce pollution and provide a more reliable way to travel. However, the group also recognised that this would be expensive, and that the government may have other priorities for their spending. The group also recognised that the current public transport system is very good in some areas, but not in others. The group felt that the government should focus their efforts on improving public transport in the areas where it is currently the worst. The group felt that it should also make efforts to improve other forms of transport, such as cycling, in order to reduce congestion and pollution and improve reliability.
