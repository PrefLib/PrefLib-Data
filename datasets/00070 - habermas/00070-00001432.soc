# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the current voting system in the UK works well. However, there are some aspects of the system that could be improved. The most important of these is the frequency of elections. The current system allows the party in power to call an election whenever they want, which gives them an unfair advantage. This should be changed so that elections are held on a regular basis, for example every four years. This will ensure that the government is held accountable for their actions, and will also make it harder for the government to call an election at a time that suits them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We think that the current voting system is a democratic way of voting, however it could be improved. Firstly, the voting system could be improved by implementing a change to how we vote, rather than an FPTP voting system, a more proportional system could be put in place. Furthermore, we think that changes should be made to how often elections take place. We think that if they were to be on a more regular basis it would reduce the number of times elections are called due to the fact that the current party is not happy with the government. This could be a major improvement, as it would save the country money and would increase the democracy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The current system is working well enough to not change. There is no need for the change, as the current system does a good job.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although the current system is not perfect, it is the best system and works well enough to not make any changes. A majority is always the best system. The current voting system should be left as it is.
