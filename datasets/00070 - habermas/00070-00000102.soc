# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Although some people see it as a 'gateway drug' I personally think alcohol makes many people act worse and rely on it more than cannabis. Mainly though I think the legalising of it would help stop drug dealers selling it which is a good thing as it stops people getting involved in those situations. People who want it are going to find a way to get it and giving a safe, monitored way of giving people it makes sense. I agree that cannabis can make people more prone to mental health issues so perhaps education will be key here. I disagree that it should just be legalised for those who really need it for medical needs alone though. I think it should be legalised, with safeguards, for all.”

People who want it are going to find a way to get it and giving a safe, monitored way of giving people it makes sense. However, if it's legalised I feel it would make the drug trade better in a sense where it isn't imported from different countries illegally. I disagree that it should just be legalised for those who really need it for medical needs alone though. I think it should be legalised, with safeguards, for all. This way, there would be a reduction in crime, a decrease in the demand for dangerous narcotics, and the emergence of a regulated market for cannabis, with some much needed tax revenue. I don't however agree that it will make people lazy, that's an unfounded and sweeping statement. The last sentence should be deleted as the question is 'for recreational use' and pain relief etc is not recreational that is medical so that is irrelevant to the question.”

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The legalisation of cannabis for recreational use would see an end to drug dealers and increase the safety of people procuring the drug. Legalisation would see an end to the criminalisation of users and the tax on the sale of the drug could help to fund treatment for those who become addicted. Legalisation would also reduce the number of people involved in petty crime who use the money to fund their habit. However, cannabis has been shown to lead to mental health issues, which could increase if the drug was legalised. Further, there is no evidence to show that cannabis is a 'gateway drug' to harder drugs. Overall, we believe the benefits of legalisation outweigh the disadvantages and therefore we support the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use.
