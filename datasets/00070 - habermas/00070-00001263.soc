# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Most school exams are not too easy. The evidence of a couple of participants who found exams difficult as well as the fact that exams are regularly reviewed by the government to avoid any ceiling effects proves that exams are not too easy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Most school exams are not too easy. The exams are set to be a level of difficulty that most students will be able to cope with and still pass. However, the exams are still stressful for many students and this can cause issues for their mental health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Most school exams are not too easy. There is a need to ensure that all students are able to access the curriculum and the exams are the best way of assessing this. Therefore, the exams cannot be too difficult as this would mean that some students would not be able to access the curriculum and would not be able to demonstrate their learning. There is also a need to ensure that the exams are challenging enough to assess the students and to ensure that they are being stretched to their full potential. Therefore, the exams cannot be too easy as this would mean that the students are not being stretched to their full potential. The exams are set at a level that is appropriate for the students.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It was thought that the question was too broad to be able to answer, but that in general school exams are set to a level appropriate for the age of the students and their expected academic level, however some schools do over-estimate the ability of their students which is where the problems of 'over-easy' exams comes in. However, a very important thing to consider is the fact that exam boards vary depending on the area, for example, some of the best students in the country live in the south of England, therefore some exam boards will make their exams easier, whereas in the north of England there are not as many brilliant students, so the exams there will be harder.
