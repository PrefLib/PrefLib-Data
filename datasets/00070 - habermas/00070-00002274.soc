# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK is not too permissive when it comes to regulating gun ownership. I think the UK has a very good system in place when it comes to guns and ownership. The UK is strict in terms of what people can and cannot buy. In terms of knife crime, I think this is more of an issue than gun crime, and it is essential to tackle knife crime first. I think it is important to ensure that people are aware of what is legal and illegal when it comes to guns. If we educate people about the law in regards to guns, then I think we can prevent crime and ensure that people abide by the law and use guns responsibly. I also think that knife crime should be tackled first, as this is more of an issue in the UK than gun crime.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK is not too permissive when it comes to regulating gun ownership. This is because gun crime is not prevalent in the UK as it is in countries like America and we feel there is little need to change the rules for gun ownership. I think it is important to ensure that people are aware of what is legal and illegal when it comes to guns. This prevents gun crime and ensures that people abide by the law and use guns responsibly.  I think it is also important to tackle knife crime in the UK as it is prevalent. This is something that people have the power to control and therefore should do.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In the UK, gun crime is relatively rare and strict gun laws are in place to make sure that gun crime remains rare. If a person wants a gun, they must prove that they need one and even then, they are not able to purchase them. I think that this is a very good system in place. Gun crime is much more common in the USA and this is likely due to stricter laws in the UK. If people were to have easy access to guns in the UK, then I think that gun crime would be more prevalent. I think that it is important to educate people about gun laws and to ensure that people are aware of the regulations and laws in place regarding guns. I think that it is also important to educate young people about the dangers of guns and the consequences of using guns in crimes. I think that it is also important to address knife crime. There have been a number of incidents in the UK where young people have been stabbed and killed, and this is something that I think needs to be addressed. Therefore, I think that it is important to tackle knife crime, and gun crime, and to educate young people about the dangers of using weapons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: There is always room for improvement in terms of regulating guns; however the UK is quite strict already and I do not think it is too permissive at present. It is important to constantly monitor laws to ensure that they are in the best interests of the people, and reflect that people are abiding by them. In terms of education, it is important to educate people about gun laws so that the general public know what they are, and don't fall foul of them. However, not many people are 'outlaws' who are 'slipping through the net', it is important to increase public awareness to ensure that no one is slipping through the net. To be the most effective in preventing crime, it may be more worthwhile to look at knife crime, due to this being more prevalent. There is room for improvement when it comes to regulating guns, and I do think that more can be done when it comes to preventing crime.
