# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The Iraq war was a huge mistake, and it is clear now that it was based on lies. Tony Blair should be tried for war crimes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should never have gone to war in Iraq. It is clear from the beginning that the decision was based on lies and misinformation. It's also clear that this decision to go to war caused the death of a significant number of innocent civilians. We can never know how many were actually killed, but we do know that they were killed because the UK decided to go to war in Iraq. It's also likely that a significant number of soldiers from the UK died as a result of the war, many in circumstances that could be seen as unnecessary. This war was a major mistake, the UK government had little involvement in the country prior to the war and now we see the results of this terrible mistake in the form of IS, a terrible evil that we are now faced with.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, I don't think so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the UK entering the Iraq War. The reasons for this included the fact that the UK was not directly affected by the war, and the fact that the UK did not have enough evidence to justify going to war. The participants were also opposed to the way in which the UK entered the war, and in particular the way in which Tony Blair lied to Parliament and the public about the reasons for going to war. The participants were also opposed to the way in which the war has been conducted, and in particular the way in which it has led to the deaths of many civilians.
