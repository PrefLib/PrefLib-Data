# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of building more nuclear power stations. The main argument in favour of building more nuclear power stations is that they are a clean source of energy and they provide a reliable source of energy. It was also argued that nuclear power stations are not harmful to the environment, because the waste is contained and the only way it can be harmful to the environment is if there is a breach in the containment, which is very unlikely to happen. It was also argued that there are risks associated with any type of energy source and it is better to have a clean source of energy. The main argument against building more nuclear power stations was that there is a risk of accidents, such as Chernobyl. It was also argued that there is no solution for the waste and it is harmful to the environment. The group in general was in favour of building more nuclear power stations, but there was a general agreement that more research should be done in this area, in order to make sure that the nuclear power stations are safe.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Whilst nuclear power is a great way of generating electricity, the world is not ready for more nuclear power stations. There are too many dangers that come with them, for example, what if there was an accident, would we be prepared for it? The world has changed a lot since Chernobyl and although we have learnt from that disaster, we need to be prepared for another one, and we are not. I believe that we should use other forms of renewable energy to generate electricity, such as wind power and solar power. These are much safer and have less of an impact on the environment.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the building of more nuclear power stations. The consensus view was that nuclear power was a dirty and dangerous source of energy. The group felt that if there was a need for more energy in the UK then the best solution would be to look to renewable energy sources. The group felt that the threat of radiation leaks was a major concern and that this risk was too great. The group felt that the UK government should be looking at other ways to provide energy for the UK. The group felt that the UK government was putting profits before people and that they should be looking at the long term effects of nuclear power.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although there are many arguments for and against the building of more nuclear power stations, it is our view that careful consideration should be made before building any more nuclear power stations. We believe that although they may be needed, there should be careful risk assessments completed and every other possible option exhausted first of all.
