# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is difficult to reach a consensus view on the proposed HS2 project, as it is a question that is difficult to answer and there are many different factors to consider. There are arguments for and against, and although the majority of the group would not vote to have the project built, the group have all been able to listen to the other views and reach a compromise. This compromise is that HS2 would have an impact on employment and the economy, and the economic benefits of the project would outweigh the environmental and social costs. The group believe that there are better ways to improve the economy, such as reducing the tax burden, however HS2 is also an investment in our transport system. If we want the UK to remain competitive on the world stage, then we need a fast, reliable and well connected transport system. The majority of the group still believe that the money should be used to upgrade the current rail network to the standard that we require, and that it is in need of improvement and investment, however a consensus view was reached that although the project is not an ideal way of improving the transport system, it is a step in the right direction and we should invest in our future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In principle, HS2 is a good idea, however the cost of building it and the time it will take to complete means that we should not be building it at this time. We should be investing in other more important infrastructure projects and revisit HS2 in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There are pros and cons to building HS2, but on balance the pros outweigh the cons. It will help to drive the economy in the long term and provide jobs in the short and medium term. The UK suffers from the lack of leveling up in the regions and this will help to address that making it easier to move people around and drive investment and jobs. It will also relieve some pressure on the housing market with people more able to travel using HS2. The counter argument is that there are higher priorities for investment, such as health or education, but these investments don't need to be mutually exclusive and on balance HS2 should be built.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes, as long as the cost and delivery times are reasonable.
