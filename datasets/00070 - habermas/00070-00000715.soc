# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the use of animals in scientific research is not acceptable as there are other ways to conduct research. In some cases, however, it may be necessary, such as for testing drugs that may save countless human lives. In these cases, the suffering of the animal should be minimised as much as possible, and they should only be used for reasons that improve the whole of humanity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is acceptable to use animals for scientific research on the basis that the suffering of the animal is minimised. It is also important that the research is carried out for reasons that improve the whole of humanity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that the use of animals in scientific research is acceptable, on the basis that the suffering of the animals is minimised and that there is a greater good to be achieved. This is on the condition that other options are not available. If this is the case, then the greater good that comes from the research is imperative.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the use of animals in scientific research is not acceptable. If animals are to be used in scientific research, it should be for reasons that will benefit all of humanity and not just a small portion of it. Animals should only be used if it is absolutely necessary and if there is no other alternative. It is also important to note that not all animals are equal in terms of their intelligence and capacity for suffering. As such, the extent of the research that can be carried out on them will differ. For example, more invasive research can be carried out on a chicken than a dog, as chickens are generally regarded as being less intelligent than dogs.
