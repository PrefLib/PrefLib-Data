# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that reducing alcoholism is the more important priority because it is the more common problem and is the cause of a greater number of medical problems than drug use.  This has been evidenced by the fact that it has been declared by WHO as a global health problem.  Alcoholism is more easily accessible and alcohol is very heavily advertised which can lead to addiction and heavy usage which leads to a multitude of medical problems, both acute and chronic.  Heavy alcohol use is associated with an increased risk of liver disease, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, as well as more than 200 other health conditions.  Drug use is not advertised in the same way as alcohol and there is a greater level of stigma associated with drug use.  Reducing alcoholism would also reduce drug use because many drug users are heavy alcohol users and the two are often linked.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a greater focus on reducing alcoholism. This is due to the fact that alcohol is more widely available, more socially accepted and is more harmful to health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Both are equally important priorities. Alcoholism and drug use are serious problems that need to be tackled. Both can have serious health consequences and both can lead to an increase in crime. The best way to tackle this would be to provide more education to young people and the wider public about the dangers of alcoholism and drug use. This would hopefully lead to a reduction in alcoholism and drug use and would hopefully lead to a reduction in crime. However, it would be very difficult to say which is the more important priority. Alcoholism and drug use are very different problems that need to be tackled in different ways. Therefore, it would be very difficult to say which is the more important priority. Both are very important priorities.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Reducing alcoholism is the more important priority. This is because alcoholism is more common and the harm caused by alcohol is more severe and expensive to treat than drug use.  The health risks from alcoholism can include liver disease, cancer, stroke and heart disease. There is a clear need for much better education about alcohol to help prevent alcoholism from starting in the first place.
