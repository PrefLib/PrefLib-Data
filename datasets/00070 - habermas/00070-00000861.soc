# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Businesses with more than 500 employees should be required to publish their gender pay gaps. At the moment there is unfair inequality in the way that men and women are treated. Gender pay gaps are evidence of this injustice. Both men and women are capable of doing the same job equally, so they should be getting paid equally too. I believe we need to change the economy so that women are not discriminated against and to ensure this does not happen again. There should not be a pay gap when doing the same role at all. Maybe the law needs to be changed to prevent this happening.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Companies with more than 500 employees should be required to publish gender pay gaps. There is no reason in today’s modern society why women should get paid less than men for doing the same job. The way the economy is structured at the moment is creating injustice and inequality and gender pay gaps are just one of the symptoms of this. Inequality affects everyone but not equally. Most people will be on the losing side. Men and women doing the same job should be paid the same amount, however this does not always happen. The market cannot be relied on to prevent the continuation of gender discrimination. That is why a law should be passed to make companies publish their gender pay gaps so that the issue can be made public. With publicity the issue of the pay gap will be more easily confronted and will start to disappear over time. Companies will change their ways of working so as to avoid the embarrassment of having a big gender pay gap. The current capitalist system creates conditions that produce pay gaps; without changing the system, there will never be a society of gender equality and pay gaps.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Companies with more than 500 employees should be required to publish gender pay gaps. There is absolutely no excuse for any type of gender pay gap; to justify it means discriminating against someone for what they cannot help – that is the sex they were born into. We should strive to ensure that the playing field for men and women in society and business is even, especially when it comes to the most essential of resources, pay. Women are entitled to equal pay for the same work as men. Women deserve an equal opportunity to get ahead. When this opportunity is taken away because of preconceptions and historical processes they cannot help, the system is being entirely unfair to these women. Publishing gender pay gaps means that there can be no cover-up. There will be pressure on businesses with large gender pay gaps to show an improvement, perhaps resulting in a ‘top up’ payment for women currently being underpaid or similar measures to reduce pay gaps. It will allow for businesses which currently maintain gender pay gaps to have some form of shaming. Publicly, gender pay gaps will look much worse when publishing data of this kind, which is why pay equality is necessary to retain reputation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Companies with more than 500 employees should be required to publish gender pay gaps. The way that the current economy is structured is unfair and unequal and gender pay gaps are one symptom of this. The issue of gender pay gaps is an issue of inequality. If men and women are doing the same job, they should be paid the same. There should be no excuse for a gender pay gap. We need to change the system so that it is more equal. We need to work towards a more equal society where gender pay gaps are a thing of the past.
