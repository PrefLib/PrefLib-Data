# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Britain does have a debt problem. The debt is in the billions, we lost our AAA rating and are struggling to deal with inflation and recession. This has led to a significant cost of living crisis, people can’t afford to live and they have been promised pay rises in line with inflation, these have not materialised due to the high levels of debt. The UK government need to come up with a plan to address this debt and to help people cope with inflation and recession. We are going through difficult times but we need to deal with this debt, and come up with a plan to manage it and to keep it from growing further. The debt needs to be dealt with now, before it spirals out of control. We need to increase taxes on the wealthy to provide the money to reduce the debt and to help the people.”

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Britain has a debt problem. The debt is in the billions, and the UK government needs to come up with a plan to address this before it spirals out of control. Debt is part of the reason why we are facing recession and the high levels of inflation that are proving so difficult for people to cope with. A negative multiplier is in play, a cycle of stagnation and low investment (due to high levels of government debt) keeps unemployment high, which contributes to low demand, which contributes to lower economic growth and even higher levels of government debt. The government needs to put a plan in place to deal with the debt and to break the cycle of stagnation, high government debt and low economic growth. The cost of living crisis is real and is one of the consequences of the debt problem facing the UK at this point in time. The government needs to take action to control the debt, to get the country back into a positive growth phase and to enable pay rises to be passed on to workers (in line with inflation). If this issue is ignored for too long, the problems will become harder to deal with and the consequences could be far worse.”

This debt is affecting everyone, rich and poor alike, and everyone will be affected by the recession and by the cost of living crisis.”
