# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK needs to be more progressive and we need to see an increase in tax on high income earners, however we should be careful not to raise the threshold too high as this will deter business and innovation. The tax should be ring fenced for specific areas such as health, education, public sector employment and infrastructure to prevent it being spent on anything else. The government should clamp down on tax loopholes and ensure that tax avoiders are harshly dealt with. In addition, I would like to add that we should look at closing loopholes that are used to allow individuals to shift tax liability to other countries, such as moving funds through tax havens, which could be achieved by harmonising tax policies between countries. We should also see a change in the inheritance tax, with an increased rate for higher amounts of inheritance and an exemption from this tax for those who receive a small amount of inheritance, especially for family homes. Finally, a potential alternative would be to remove the personal allowance for high earners and replace it with a higher tax rate for those who earn above a certain threshold, as this would be more efficient and fair.

Discussion and Conclusions The researchers did not provide any information regarding the response rate to the questionnaires or regarding the distribution of the number of participants that responded to each question. The participants had a very different starting position on the topic, ranging from "The highest bracket yes. Their wealth is astonishing in some cases. I know it is a small % of the population but the top 1$ could easily pay more and be far wealthier than the rest of the country. I also think that tax loopholes need to be shut down. I believe the extra tax revenue should go straight into NHS funding" to "I don't think high earners should be taxed further as this will lead to individuals and businesses relocating to more attractive tax regimes
