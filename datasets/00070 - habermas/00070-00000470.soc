# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a distinction between free school meals for all children, and free school meals for those in poverty. The group believed that free school meals for all children would be too expensive. It was also felt that it would be difficult to target the children in poverty without them being labelled. The group believed that if free school meals were only offered to children in poverty, then this would mean that the local authority could afford to spend more money on other services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group decided that not every child should be given free school meals. It would be too expensive, and this money could be spent better elsewhere. The group agreed that the local authority should target children from deprived households. The local authority should consider the proportion of children in poverty in the area, and provide free school meals for children in poverty. This would be the most efficient way to use the resources of the local authority. The group agreed that the free school meals should be provided discreetly, and that parents should not be labelled.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of free school meals. The group felt that not all children should get free school meals as this would be too expensive. It was felt that there were some children in poverty that would benefit. The group decided that it would be sensible to offer free school meals to those children in poverty. It was suggested that the free school meal could be targeted at children in poverty at the moment, but children should not be labelled. The local authority would need to consider the proportion of children that were in poverty in the area. The cost of providing free school meals to every child in the local authority would be very expensive, and this would mean less money for other services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children should not go hungry. We should target free school meals to children who are in poverty. It would be too expensive to provide free school meals to all children in the local authority. It is difficult to distinguish between children who are in poverty and those who are not, and there is a risk that children who receive free school meals will be labelled as being in poverty. If the local authority cannot afford to provide free school meals to all children in poverty, then the money could be spent on other things that would help children who are in poverty.
