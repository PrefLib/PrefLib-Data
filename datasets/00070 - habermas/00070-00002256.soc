# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that we should change our immigration policy to allow a larger amount of skilled workers into the country, but there should be a limit as to how many can enter. We think that there are not enough skilled workers to carry out important roles, such as doctors and nurses in the NHS, as so many of these workers are leaving the country, or are reaching retirement age, and we don't have the younger people to take their place. We also think that there should be a set of tests that the skilled workers should go through to prove that they are skilled and would be valuable to our country. We also believe that the skilled workers should only be allowed to stay in the country for a set amount of time, and then they must leave.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final consensus statement: We believe that we should change our immigration policy to allow a larger amount of skilled workers into the country. We think that there aren't enough skilled workers to carry out important roles, such as doctors and nurses in the NHS, as so many of these workers are leaving the country, or are reaching retirement age, and we don't have the younger people to take their place. There should be a limit to the number of skilled workers who are allowed to enter the country. This should be to ensure that the country doesn't become overcrowded. We think that skilled workers should go through a series of tests to prove that they have the skills they claim and will be valuable to our country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that we should change our immigration policy to allow a larger amount of skilled workers into the country, but there should be a limit as to how many can enter. We think that there are not enough skilled workers to carry out important roles, such as doctors and nurses in the NHS, as so many of these workers are leaving the country, or are reaching retirement age, and we don't have the younger people to take their place. We also think that there should be a set of tests that the skilled workers should go through to prove that they are skilled and would be valuable to our country.
