# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While I feel everyone has a responsibility in reducing inequality I believe the government has a strong role in this.  The trouble is there has been evidence of this even in the house of commons itself, they should also not be seen to be getting away with this, it is rife.  I'm not sure how they can achieve this but something has to be done.  No one should be made to feel less adequate due to sex, background, skin colour, disability status etc.  There should be harsher punishments and a closer eye on businesses and individuals in the spotlight.  On the other end there are actually assumptions made by people that due to backgrounds / money / power certain individuals are seen as untouchable.  While not directly linked people need a voice and a platform to openly discuss these issues and government needs to be seen to be doing more to target and resolve these issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I strongly agree with this statement. Nowadays inequality is a very important issue which needs to be addressed and resolved in the best of ways. People shouldn’t have to be treated differently based on their background, religion or sex orientation and I think it is the government’s job to ensure that everyone is treated in the same way by implementing legislation that protects everyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, government must combat inequality for social stability and economic progress. Policies ensuring equal education, healthcare, and employment can bridge the wealth gap. Support programs like affordable healthcare and education grants empower vulnerable populations, breaking the cycle of poverty. Enforcing workplace fairness and progressive tax reforms further level the playing field. Ultimately, reducing inequality is both a moral duty and an economic requirement, fostering a balanced society and sustainable development.  In conclusion, reducing inequality is not just a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. Government policies and initiatives are instrumental in creating a more equitable society, fostering social harmony, and driving sustainable economic development.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I strongly believe the government should have a role in reducing inequality although I do not think that the current government understands what inequality truly is as they are so out of touch with 'normal' people. Lack of money is a huge factor in the opportunities someone has to become successful-for example, how can children who don't have a proper bedroom or food for breakfast be expected to learn and develop in the same way as their peers?  Reducing inequality should start with trying to ensure everyone has a basic level playing field when it comes to having adequate food, heating, accommodation and access to public resources.
