# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we do not think that people should be allowed to pay for faster criminal justice procedures. The criminal justice system is a fundamental right that should be available to everyone, regardless of their financial background. If people are allowed to pay for faster procedures, then this will lead to a two-tier system where people with more money will be able to jump the queue and have their cases heard more quickly. This is unfair and will lead to discrimination. It will also lead to a conflict of interest where the police and other criminal justice bodies will have an incentive to arrest more people in the hope that they will pay to have their cases heard more quickly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, people should not be allowed to pay for faster criminal justice procedures. The introduction of a payment system would be unethical as it would create an uneven and unfair system. Legal advice and justice should be available to everyone regardless of their financial background and personal circumstances. The introduction of a payment system could lead to discrimination and an uneven and unfair system. It could also cause police forces to arrest more people out of a hope that they can fufill certain quotas for money. This means a conflict of interest.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, people should not be allowed to pay for faster criminal justice procedures. It is unfair that people with more money will be able to jump the queue and get their case heard faster than people with less money. This will lead to a two-tier system where people with more money will be able to get better treatment and this is unfair. It is also likely to lead to more people being arrested as the police will be incentivised to arrest more people in the hope that they will be able to pay to get their case heard faster. This is likely to lead to discrimination and could lead to more innocent people being arrested and having their lives ruined. It is also likely to lead to a conflict of interest as the police will have an incentive to arrest more people in the hope that they will be able to pay to get their case heard faster.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, people should not be allowed to pay for faster criminal justice procedures. We don't think that it is fair that people with more money can pay for a faster procedure. This could lead to discrimination and an uneven and unfair system. We think that legal advice and justice should be available to everyone regardless of their financial background and personal circumstances. Introducing a payment system could lead to discrimination and an uneven and unfair system. We also think that this could lead to a conflict of interest, as federal bodies could hold people for longer in the justice system in the hope that they will pay to speed up the process. This means that a conflict of interest could occur. It could also cause police forces to arrest more people out of a hope that they can fulfill certain quotas for money.
