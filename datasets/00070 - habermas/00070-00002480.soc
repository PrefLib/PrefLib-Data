# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to increasing the tax on air fares in the UK. The group felt that increasing the tax on air fares would be unfair, especially on low income households. The group also felt that increasing the tax would not have the desired effect of reducing CO2 emissions. Instead, the group felt that working with the airlines and fuel suppliers would be a more effective way of reducing CO2 emissions. The group felt that increasing the tax on air fares would not be a good way of reducing the number of flights made by plane, as many journeys that could be made by cleaner modes such as rail are currently made by plane. The group felt that increasing the tax would not incentivise people to make journeys by cleaner modes of transport.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to increasing the tax on air fares in the UK. The group felt that increasing the tax on air fares would not be an effective way to reduce the number of people flying and therefore would not reduce the amount of CO2 emissions from the aviation industry. The group also felt that increasing the tax on air fares would be unfair on lower income households who might be priced out of holidays entirely. The group felt that the government should be looking at other ways to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions from the aviation industry, such as working with the airlines and also working with the fuel suppliers to produce a long term solution to the problem rather than a short term penaulty. The group also felt that it was important to acknowledge that aviation is a high-emitting sector and similar that initiatives such as clean air zones and sugar tax have worked in reducing other undesirable behaviours.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “In general, the group was in favour of increasing the tax on air fares in the UK for environmental reasons. However, there was some concern that this would put the cost of flights out of the reach of lower income households. The group also felt that this would be a short term solution to the problem, and that a longer term solution would be to work with airlines and fuel suppliers to develop cleaner fuels and greener aircraft. The group felt that this would be a more effective way of reducing CO2 emissions from aviation. The group also felt that tax is a very blunt instrument and would not necessarily have the desired effect of reducing air travel. The group felt that it would be better to invest in rail infrastructure to make this a more attractive option for journeys that could be made by rail. This would also be more equitable for lower income households, as rail fares would remain affordable.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to increasing the tax on air fares in the UK. The group felt that increasing the tax on air fares would not be an effective way to reduce the number of people flying and therefore would not reduce the amount of CO2 emissions from the aviation industry. The group also felt that increasing the tax on air fares would be unfair on lower income households who might be priced out of holidays entirely. The group felt that the government should be looking at other ways to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions from the aviation industry, such as working with the airlines and also working with the fuel suppliers to produce a long term solution to the problem rather than a short term penaulty. The group also felt that initiatives such as clean air zones and sugar tax have worked in reducing other undesirable behaviours and the air travel tax should also be considered as an effective tool.
