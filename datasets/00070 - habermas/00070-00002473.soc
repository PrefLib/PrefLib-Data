# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to increasing the tax on air fares in the UK. The group felt that increasing the tax on air fares would not be an effective way to reduce the number of people flying and therefore would not reduce the amount of CO2 emissions from the aviation industry. The group also felt that increasing the tax on air fares would be unfair on lower income households who might be priced out of holidays entirely. The group felt that the government should be looking at other ways to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions from the aviation industry, such as working with the airlines and also working with the fuel suppliers to produce a long term solution to the problem rather than a short term penaulty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to increasing the tax on air fares in the UK. The group felt that increasing the tax would have a disproportionate impact on lower income households and would prevent them from taking holidays. The group also felt that increasing the tax would not have the desired effect of reducing CO2 emissions. The group felt that tax is a very blunt tool and there are better ways to reduce Co2 emissions as a result of flying. This could be through working with the airlines and also working with the fuel suppliers to produce a long term solution to the problem rather than a short term penaulty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the tax on air fares in the UK, however, there was a strong feeling that this should not be done in isolation and that the government should provide a clear plan on how the revenue will be used to combat climate change. The group felt that the revenue should be ring-fenced and used to provide subsidies for cleaner modes of transport, such as rail, and also to provide subsidies for lower income households who may be priced out of holidays. The group also felt that it was important to work with airlines and fuel suppliers to provide a long term solution to the problem of climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should increase the tax on air fares in the UK. Aviation is one of the most significant contributors to global warming and the level of GHG emitted per passenger is disproportionate when compared to other modes of transport. Many journeys that could be made by cleaner modes such as rail are currently made by plane, and this should be disincentivised. The revenue collected from air fare taxation could be put towards climate initiatives. The increase in tax would be a very blunt tool, however it would be a start. We should also work with airlines and fuel suppliers to produce a long term solution to the problem rather than a short term penalty. This would be more effective and would also be more fair on lower income households.
