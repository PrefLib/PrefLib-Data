# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the UK government should not make all the decisions regarding what is taught in school. There should be some sort of national curriculum, but the government should not decide what should and shouldn't be taught in schools as this can lead to certain important things being left out. The government could advise that certain things should be included but that should be as far as it should go. Education unions and teachers have more of an idea of what pupils need to learn for todays university courses and apprenticeships. It has been found that pupils are better placed to remember the information that is discussed and debated in the classroom, rather than text book reading and copying, and the classroom is one place where the government has no presence, other than through the national curriculum. Teachers and other individuals who interact with children daily are more adept at imparting knowledge and taking into account the pupils' needs, rather than making decisions for the whole country.

However, as the government is providing the funding for education it is fair that they should be involved in what is being taught to ensure that it meets national requirements.
