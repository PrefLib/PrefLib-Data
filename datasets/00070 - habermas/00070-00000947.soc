# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, there should not be compulsory voting. While the idea of compulsory voting may seem good in theory, in practice it would lead to a number of problems. For example, if a person is forced to vote for a party they do not support, they may spoil their ballot paper or vote for a party they do not support. This would lead to a large number of wasted votes and would be detrimental to the democratic process. A better way to increase voter turnout would be to make politics more engaging and to put forward candidates that people can believe in and trust.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, there should not be compulsory voting. The right to vote is a basic human right and should not be taken away. Also, if people are forced to vote, they may spoil their ballot papers or make ill informed decisions. The solution to low voter turnout is not making it a crime not to vote, it is about making politics engaging for everybody and putting forward candidates that people can actually believe in and trust.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, there should not be compulsory voting. The right to vote is an important part of democracy, and people should be free to exercise their right to vote, or not to vote, as they wish. If we force people to vote, they will vote for candidates they do not support, or spoil their ballot papers, and this will lead to a less representative democracy. The solution to low voter turnout is not to force people to vote, but to make politics more engaging for everybody and to put forward candidates that people can actually believe in and trust.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, because it is not a good idea to force people to vote, and it is not a good idea to make voting a crime. People should be free to vote or not vote as they wish. The way to get more people to vote is to make politics more interesting and engaging, and to put forward candidates that people can believe in and trust.
