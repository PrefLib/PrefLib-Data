# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “There should be a ban on single-use plastic water bottles.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a ban on small plastic water bottles. The ban should be implemented as soon as possible. There are already very good alternatives to plastic water bottles, such as aluminium cans and reusable bottles. The plastic bottles are very wasteful and very harmful to the environment. The plastic bottles are often not disposed of correctly and end up as litter. This leads to plastic pollution and is very damaging to the environment. There should be more of an effort to promote using bottles that can be reused, not just single use. There should be a scheme to recycle bottles with a small financial reward.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, there should be a ban on small plastic water bottles. The bottles are wasteful, and alternatives are available. The bottles are often not disposed of correctly and cause harm to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a ban on small plastic water bottles. There are already very good alternatives to plastic water bottles that could be used instead. The number of plastic bottles that are used and then disposed of is not only wasteful, but damaging to the environment. There should be more emphasis on the use of reusable bottles and a ban on small plastic water bottles should be implemented.
