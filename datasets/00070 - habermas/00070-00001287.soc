# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Social media sites should have the right to delete any content that they believe is “offensive”, however, they should also have a clear standard to define what is meant by “offensive”. The social media should ensure that users are well protected and not offended. They should also ensure that the content which is harmful, eg. which incites violence or hatred or which is pornographic or violent etc in itself should be removed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We think social media sites should have the right to delete content they believe is “offensive”. We agree that there should be clear guidelines to define what is meant by “offensive” and we also believe that social media sites should protect users from being offended. However, we also believe that the right to free speech should be respected and people should be able to express their opinions and have access to information even if it is controversial.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that social media sites should have the right to delete any content that they believe is “offensive”. However, this power needs to be moderated as it can often become arbitrary. The extent to which these sites can remove content will depend upon the jurisdiction and culture of each country. The removal of offensive content can often prevent hate speech and racism. This prevents the development of new ideas that may be useful in changing society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Social media sites should have the right to delete content that is harmful, incites violence or hatred or which is pornographic or violent etc in itself. The social media should ensure that users are well protected and not offended. The social media aggregators usually have community guidelines that outline acceptable behaviour and content which aim to create safe and tedious environment for everyone else.
