# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of a public education system, though they agreed that grammar schools should be allowed to exist. They were in favour of a single-tier system, though they did recognise that in the current climate it would be difficult to move to this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Education should be public. Private schools perpetuate inequality. The government should invest in the public education system and give all children the best possible start in life. Grammar schools should be abolished and there should be no segregation of children based on ability.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of public education systems for all. The group felt that a two-tier system in which the private school system gave its pupils an advantage over the public school system was unfair. It was also felt that a public school system would give pupils a more rounded education and provide them with a greater sense of community. However, some participants felt that if the private school system was scrapped then the government would not invest enough in the public school system to improve it and provide the same quality of education. It was also felt that a public school system would increase social mobility and give children from all backgrounds the same opportunities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Education should be public for all, as the current system is unfair and creates elitism. It should be free and accessible to all. The current system is unfair as it perpetuates the social inequality in our society.
