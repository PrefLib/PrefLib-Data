# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, we have come to the decision that the monarchy should not be the head of the Church of England. This is because the UK is a very diverse place to live in and is moving towards a more modern life. The monarchy can be perceived as more neutral if they are not the head of the Church of England. We also think that the monarchy is an old fashioned tradition that people still hold onto, but it does not serve the people and actually perpetuates the class gap. We should aim for less elitism and encourage a society without huge class gaps. We also think that the monarchy is not very modern and in order to become more modern they would have to have a more diverse viewpoint by not being head of the Church of England would help this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, the monarchy should continue to be the head of the Church of England as they have been for many years and to change this would not be in the interest of the UK. This is because the monarch is the head of the Church of England and the Church of England is the established church of the UK. The monarch is the head of the Church of England, and the government has a duty to support the Church of England. This means that the government must act in the interests of the Church of England, and not against it. Also, the monarchy is a very important part of British culture, and has been for centuries, and it would be a shame to change this. Also, the Church of England is not a political organisation, and does not interfere in politics and economics, so it is not harmful to have them as the head.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the decision that the monarchy should not be the head of the Church of England. This is because the UK is a very diverse place to live in and is moving towards a more modern life. The monarchy can be perceived as more neutral if they are not the head of the Church of England. We also think that the monarchy is an old fashioned tradition that people still hold onto, but it does not serve the people and actually perpetuates the class gap. We should aim for less elitism and encourage a society without huge class gaps. We believe that modern life means adapting to new ways. We would challenge traditions and ask whether the tradition is currently doing more harm than good in this modern era.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the monarchy continuing as the head of the Church of England. It was agreed that the monarchy was a big part of British culture and history, and that it brought in a lot of money to the country through tourism. It was also agreed that the monarchy did a lot of good for the country and that they had made great progress to be with the times. It was noted that the monarchy was not as involved in politics and economics as they used to be, and that it was not too harmful to allow them to continue being the head of the church.
