# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to mandatory voting.  There were a number of reasons for this, including the fact that people may be forced to vote for a party they don't support, and that this would make the vote less meaningful.  However, there was also the view that people should vote if they are able to, as this is a civic duty.  This view was tempered by the fact that some people may not be able to vote due to illness or disability.  It was also noted that people are allowed to abstain from voting, and that this should be allowed to continue.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to making voting mandatory.  The group felt that people should have the right to choose whether or not to vote.  The group felt that the right to vote was a fundamental human right and making it mandatory would take that away.  The group felt that if people were forced to vote, they would not vote for the candidate they truly supported.  The group felt that forcing people to vote would not result in a more democratic outcome.  The group felt that voting should be a personal choice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Voting should not be mandatory.  Everyone has the right to choose whether or not to vote and should not be forced to do so.  Voting should be a personal choice.  The government should not be allowed to force its citizens to vote.  This is an infringement of civil liberties.  It is also a waste of resources to force people to vote.  If people are not interested in voting, then they should not be forced to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to mandatory voting.  They felt that it would lead to people voting for a party they did not really support, or not voting at all and spoiling their vote.  It was also felt that the low turnout at elections was not necessarily a bad thing, as it meant that those who did vote were more likely to be voting for a party they really supported.  It was also felt that mandatory voting could lead to more people voting for a party they did not support, as they would be more likely to vote for a party that they did not like, rather than not vote at all and risk being fined.  It was also felt that mandatory voting could lead to more spoiled votes, as people would be more likely to spoil their vote, rather than vote for a party they did not support.  The group felt that people should have the right to choose whether or not to vote, and that forcing people to vote could lead to a less accurate reflection of public opinion.
