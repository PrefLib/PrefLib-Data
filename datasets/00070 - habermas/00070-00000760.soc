# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Micro-aggressions are almost always bad. They can contribute to hostility and lower morale. They can also affect the wellbeing and mental health of individuals which can have disastrous effects long term. However, sometimes micro-aggressions are needed to release anger and get it out there in order to calm your mind. Marginalized groups should feel they are given the same treatment as everyone else.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Micro-aggressions are generally a negative thing, as aggression towards others is generally not a positive thing in our society. However, people cannot often help how they feel about others and having microaggressions as a tell can be helpful to navigate social situations. On the flip side, microaggressions related to race, gender or sexual orientation are almost always bad things. It depends more on what the person is being aggressive about rather than the action in itself.
