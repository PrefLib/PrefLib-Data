# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: Insects should be accepted as a food source in the western world. As long as they are not poisonous or contain toxins that could cause damage to human beings, then they should be accepted and given more consideration. There is growing awareness and evidence that the current food system has negative consequences for the earth and mankind, such as the release of greenhouse gases and animal farming. Insects are a good source of protein and a sustainable alternative to meat products. Global warming, greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental concerns are a developing issue with current farming methods of meat, therefore insects should be further investigated as a potential replacement. Insects are already a common food source in many eastern countries around the world, which shows they are considered to be safe. However, as insects are not a common food source in the western world then there will be some difficulties persuading more people to consider the insect option. Some people may even be disgusted by the idea of eating insects. In some areas of the world, such as developing countries, people can be starving for food and consuming insects could be a more eco-friendly and readily available option than regular meat products. Insects are also a great source of protein and can provide
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Insects should be accepted as a food product in the western world. As long as they are not poisonous or contain toxins that could cause damage to human beings, then they should be accepted and given more consideration. If insects were to be used as a food source, it could help to reduce the increasing amount of greenhouse gas emissions and the overall effects of global warming.  The University of Cambridge has recently received funds to conduct a large scale research project to assess the safety of insects as a food source. This has been partly initiated by the growing concerns about global warming and greenhouse gas emissions as a result of current meat farming methods. Therefore, it is important that as many people as possible in the western world accept insects as a food source so that more money and research can be spent on the topic. However, insects may not be appealing to everyone and this will cause difficulties for research and implementation.

There is conflicting evidence suggesting that consuming insects will harm the food chain and increase the chance of  extinction of several animals. The above statement suggests that more research needs to be done.
