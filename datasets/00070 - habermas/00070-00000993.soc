# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a distinction between drug addicts who are willing to change and drug addicts who are not willing to change. If the addict is not willing to change, then doctors should not prescribe heroin. However, if the addict is willing to change, then the doctor should be allowed to prescribe heroin to them, but only in a controlled environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of heroin being prescribed to addicts. However, the group was also aware of the fact that many countries have trialled this approach and have had great success in reducing crime and drug use. Therefore, the group came to the following consensus opinion: Heroin should be prescribed to addicts, but only in a controlled environment. The participants also suggested that doctors should be allowed to prescribe heroin, but only in very small doses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Heroin should not be prescribed by doctors to addicts. The risks outweigh the benefits. It is an addictive drug that has many adverse side effects. Heroin is also highly illegal in the UK and the penalties for being caught with it are very severe. This is also the case for other countries and this would be an illegal act. There are many other ways to treat addicts, for example methadone and other legal drugs can be prescribed to wean addicts off heroin. Heroin is also not a necessary drug and should not be prescribed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In principle, the idea of giving heroin to addicts seems like a nonsense idea. However, if doctors who can monitor doses were given a close look into the life of an addict perhaps this would better allow for reform away from drugs and an opportunity to take drugs in a 'safer' way. Though, overall I still think this is a ridiculous idea by principle and instead we should continue seeking to help addicts get away from drugs.
