# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The NHS is the nations largest single employer, and in many ways is a cornerstone of the British way of life. It should be a fundamental right that everyone is able to access health care when needed. The problem is, the current system is not working, and is not sustainable in the long term. There needs to be a complete overhaul of the system, and some deep thinking is needed. This is not to say the NHS should be privatised, but there needs to be serious reform. This reform must include, more resources and funding, more investment into training and retaining staff, reducing the reliance on private contractors, and removing red tape. In addition, funding needs to be ring fenced and protected, and the way that health care is funded needs to be addressed. This could include, for example, an increased contribution from National Insurance.“
