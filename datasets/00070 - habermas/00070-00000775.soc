# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There was a strong consensus that in an ideal world, all adults should be given a monthly allowance. However, it was recognised that this was not currently feasible and that there were many issues with it. The group discussed how this would be very expensive and that this would need to be funded by taxes, which would be unpopular. They also discussed that the rich would be able to save this money and get richer, while the poor would need to spend it on necessities. The group also discussed that people would not be motivated to work and that this would affect the economy. However, the group thought that in an ideal world this would be a good idea and that it should be something that we should aim for in the future.
