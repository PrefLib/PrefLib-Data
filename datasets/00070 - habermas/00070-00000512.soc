# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is still hope for us to eradicate malaria. Malaria can be eradicated just like other diseases that were once considered untreatable. We need to invest more into research to discover a cure. We need to educate people about the risks of malaria and how to prevent it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Malaria is a significant global health concern, but many groups and individuals around the world are making great strides to eradicate the disease. We believe with advances in medical science, the threats to global health caused by malaria will be a thing of the past.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the participants were optimistic and thought that in the future we will eventually find a cure for malaria.  They said that medical science is continually advancing and as it is, there are some areas in the world which do not have the problem of malaria.  The participants also said that if malaria is eradicated in the developed world then it can be eradicated in the underdeveloped world too, however the task would be much more difficult and would take much longer.  There was a thought that it would not be eradicated in the near future, but it is inevitable that it will be eradicated eventually.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is likely that we will eradicate malaria. If we look at the current rate of progress, it seems unlikely that we will be able to eradicate malaria in the near future. However, with increased funding for research and a more efficient use of that funding, it may be possible. Malaria is a substantial problem in some parts of the world, and it is in the interests of many governments and charities to try and eradicate the disease. This desire to eradicate the disease should help increase funding to develop cures. Malaria is also a bigger threat than many other diseases and has killed millions, and so the desire to eradicate the disease should increase. This means that a lot of research will be dedicated to finding a cure for the disease. Many other diseases have been eradicated or nearly eradicated in the past and so there is no reason why malaria should not be eradicated. With increased funding and desire to find a cure, there is a good chance that malaria will be eradicated in the future.
