# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Politicians should not ask for personal favours. They should focus on public service and ask for help from people close to them. They should not make this an expectation for their aides.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, it is not ok for politicians to ask their aides for personal favours. However, if a politician is very close to an aide and it is not detrimental to the work they are doing for the politician, then it may be ok. The reason being that the relationship is personal as well as professional and should be kept that way. The aide is a personal friend, and the politician should be able to ask them to do something as a personal favour. It is only fair that this favour is done for the politician, as the aide would ask them for a personal favour in return. This shows how the system works. It is an accurate portrayal of the current state of the system. The way in which consensus is reached allows the final opinion to be accurate, yet with each individual's own opinion still being expressed. The group of participants had some strong arguments, but they were able to use them to form a strong and accurate opinion that they all agreed with. It is not biased, and does not favour any opinion more than another. The statement takes into account all of the views and opinions of the group, as well as the arguments presented. This is an effective consensus opinion, that takes into account the opinions of all
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - it is not OK for a politician to ask an aide for a personal favour. They argued that, if a politician wants to get something done that they could not do themselves, they should hire someone to do it. Politicians should be putting their aides in charge of things that can only be done by an aide, like speech writing, press releases, etc. If a politician needs someone to do their shopping for them, they should hire a personal shopper.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is not acceptable for politicians to ask for personal favours from aides. Aides are there to serve the public and not for the politicians’ personal interest. When this happens, there is a conflict of interests. This also could account as putting pressure on aide when they should focus on serving the large public.
