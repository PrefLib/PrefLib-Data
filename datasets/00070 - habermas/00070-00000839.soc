# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the government should increase spending on healthcare by 10% of GDP. This is because we are living longer and the population is aging. This means that more money will be spent on healthcare in the future and it would be better to start spending more now. The economy will also benefit from this because people will be healthier and can work for longer. However, this increase in spending will have to be balanced against other areas of spending.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Healthcare is one of the most important issues facing modern societies. Therefore, we should increase government spending on healthcare. However, we should also increase spending on education and research in order to develop new treatments and improve public health. Furthermore, we should also look at ways to improve health literacy and make people more aware of their own health and wellbeing.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the government should increase spending on healthcare. This will help improve the efficiency of the healthcare system, and help make it more accessible for the general public. This is especially important for people who are less well-off and who cannot afford private healthcare. However, we also recognise that increasing government spending in one area may mean reducing spending in another area. Therefore, the government should increase spending on healthcare, but only to the extent that this does not compromise spending in other areas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, we think that increasing government spending on healthcare by 10% of GDP would be a good idea. However, it is important to consider that this would require a trade-off with other government spending. Therefore, it would be important to ensure that any increase in government spending on healthcare is necessary, and that it is used in the most efficient way possible.
