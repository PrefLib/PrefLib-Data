# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It was thought that the government should provide universal healthcare. However, this should not be completely free to all, as this would cause problems. It was thought that the government should provide healthcare for all people, but a means tested system should be put in place to see what people could afford to pay. This would mean that people who can afford to pay a part of their treatment costs would do so, thus allowing more people to receive treatment. The money from these payments would go to funding the most disadvantaged in society. This would help to reduce healthcare inequalities.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should provide universal healthcare for all people, but a means tested system should be put in place to see what people could afford to pay. This would mean that people who can afford to pay a part of their treatment costs would do so, thus allowing more people to receive treatment. The money from these payments would go to funding the most disadvantaged in society. This would mean that healthcare would be provided for all, but a large majority of the population would be paying for at least a part of their treatment, thus making the whole system more sustainable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group was in agreement that universal healthcare is important to have as this ensures that all people can access healthcare. It was decided that universal healthcare should not be completely free, as this is not sustainable, but that there should be a means tested system put into place. This would mean that the people who can afford to pay could do so, allowing the poorest in society to be funded by the wealthiest. The group discussed a few ideas about what the means tested system would look like. The group debated that a tiered pricing system could work, whereby different tiers would pay different amounts. This was agreed to be a good idea as it would make the most of everyone's ability to pay, and would allow health services to be more flexible. Therefore, the government should put into place universal healthcare for all citizens, but there should be a means tested system for those who can afford to pay for a part of their treatment costs.
