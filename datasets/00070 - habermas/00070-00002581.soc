# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I think the monarchy should be the head of the church of England because it will bring people to the church. If it leaves the church of England , people will leave it also. The church needs leadership and someone to answer there critics.  I believe the church would not last without the funding from the monarchy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I do not think the monarchy should continue to be the head of the Church of England as I believe there should not be a monarchy and it would be much better for the Church of England to have a new head such as the government or the archbishop.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I am not religious so this doesn't affect me directly. As I am not a part of the affected community I don't think that what I think should have any weight in the discussion. It would be better for members of the Church of England to make the decision for themselves about who heads their organisation. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I do not believe the monarchy should continue to be the head of the Church of England. The country is majority secular and the state/religion/monarchy shouldn't be interlnked. The Monarchy take too many resources from the country when they could bring money into the country like France for example. Also with so many people in the country being secular it doesnt make sense for their to be so much emphasis on the monarchy being the head of it.
