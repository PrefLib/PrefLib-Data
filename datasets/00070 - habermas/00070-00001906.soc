# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the government should not regulate online content. The government should only regulate online content if it is illegal or it is offensive to a certain group of people. The government should not regulate online content if it is free speech.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is important that the government regulate certain online content to prevent things such as illegal pornography and racism and hate speech. There needs to be some regulation to make sure that children and younger people do not see things that could affect their behaviour. Free speech is very important and so is the ability to publish things that one might find offensive but not illegal. It is very important that we regulate the content that is illegal and that is used to manipulate young people or anyone else into committing a crime or doing something that they would not otherwise do.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of some form of regulation of online content. It was felt that regulation was needed to protect people, particularly children, from offensive and harmful content. However, it was also felt that regulation should not be too heavy handed and should not interfere with free speech. It was also felt that regulation should not be used to interfere with the democratic process.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government needs to regulate online content in order to make the internet a safer place for people to enjoy.
