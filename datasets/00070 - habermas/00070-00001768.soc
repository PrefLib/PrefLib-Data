# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People should be forced to wear helmets when cycling. While cycling on the road can be very dangerous and causing head injuries in some situations, it should not be a forced law to wear a helmet when cycling as most of the time they do use up space on the road which is occupied by cars, vans, lorries so they are putting themselves in danger.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should be forced to wear helmets when cycling. Head injuries are such a common occurrence in relation to cycling accidents weather that it connected with a general cycle accident or collision with vehicle. Wearing a helmet would protect people as opposed to not wearing one. I have had family members have serious injuries from simply falling of their bike in weather conditions and caused significant harm to themselves and the outcome would of been very different if they had a helmet on. I also think it should be a forced law to wear a helmet when cycling as most of the time they do use up space on the road which is occupied by cars, vans, lorries so they are putting themselves in danger.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should be forced to wear helmets when cycling. While some people may not fully agree with such a paternalistic law, there are many logical reasons for its existence. On a basic level, helmets are able to cushion the impact of a bicycle accident by absorbing the force of the impact that would otherwise be absorbed by the skull, face and brain. This can mitigate the consequences of the trauma. Head injuries are also very common in cycling accidents, with either a collision with a vehicle or an accident involving falling off the bike. Wearing a helmet would protect people and ultimately help save lives. It is a preventative measure to decrease the number of cycling related deaths and head injuries. To be forced to do so, is a simple yet effective measure to reduce the impact of the public health crisis this creates.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should be strongly encouraged to wear helmets when cycling because head injuries are a common occurrence and helmets provide protection.
