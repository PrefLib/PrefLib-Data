We are already seeing effects of climate change happening right in front of our eyes with changing weather patterns, global temperatures rising and rising sea levels amongst the most damaging effects. We and the government should do absolutely anything within our means to slow this process down and hopefully eventually stop it altogether so that we can have a liveable future for everyone. Conclusion Experiential learning is at the core of science learning as a “way of thinking and acting”. The Future of the Planet concept has shown the importance of group work, reflecting and thinking for your group, self-critiquing, personal engagement, in-depth analysis and creativity, but not to neglect individuals. The process did not only ask for students to understand science concepts but also engaged them in appreciating their role and the complexity of the current status and their attitudes toward the problem of climate change, but

We and the government should do absolutely anything within our means to slow this process down and hopefully eventually stop it altogether so that we can have a liveable future for everyone. I then presented this consensus view to a group of experts and asked them for their opinion of it. The experts offered the following critiques of the consensus view:
3: 1,4,3,2
1: 2,3,4,1
1: 2,4,3,1
