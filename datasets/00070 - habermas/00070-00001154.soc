# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Research findings should be published, even if they might be false or contradictory to established science.  The results of the research findings should be peer-reviewed before publication.  It is important to establish the facts in any scientific research.  The research findings will be rigorously peer-reviewed before publication and any false findings will be identified and removed.  It is important that all findings are published, even if they are contradictory to established science, because it is only through publishing all findings that the scientific community can be sure that the established science is correct.  Publishing all findings also allows the scientific community to explore all avenues of research, which may lead to new and exciting discoveries.

However, it is important that the scientific community ensures that any published research is of a high standard and that it is peer reviewed to remove any false findings.  The community also needs to take steps to ensure that the public understands the difference between research findings and scientific facts.
