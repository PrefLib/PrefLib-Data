# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Colonising the moon is a goal that is both highly unlikely and not worth pursuing in the foreseeable future.  It is not a goal that many people would consider a priority, it will not be achieved by many people, and it would have a detrimental effect on our planet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Final consensus statement: The answer to whether the moon can ever be colonised depends on several factors. The first of these is how much of the natural environment of Earth will have been destroyed or damaged by human activity in the future. The moon, being a hostile environment with limited resources, will make it a very expensive project to establish a colony. So one must also consider whether there is enough profit for it to be worthwhile? Lastly one must ask whether the good reasons of scientific and medical advancement will be sufficient motivation for humankind to colonise the moon?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In the long run, I think the benefits of colonising the moon outweigh the potential harm to our Earth. It would be a great adventure and it would provide us with more opportunities to study how the human body reacts to different environments. The cost of sending people and equipment into space is still quite high but it is something that I think will become more affordable as time goes on. It may also be something that we would need to consider in the future, if the impact of climate change becomes too great.
