# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, businesses should be taxed for their carbon emissions. Governments need to make it as difficult as possible for companies to pollute and contribute to climate change. By making it as expensive as possible to pollute, business owners will be forced to consider the environment in their business practices, and to reduce their carbon footprint. It may sound dramatic, but climate change is a serious issue and will impact the future of our planet. The time for governments to do nothing has passed. To avert catastrophe, the governments of the world must work together to change the system of government and business as we know it. Carbon must be treated as a pollutant and taxed accordingly. As business operations change to make use of more sustainable and environmentally friendly resources, the tax could be reduced, so that companies are rewarded for going green. Incentives for doing the right thing must be introduced, but penalties for contributing to the destruction of the planet must also be in place.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes. The time for governments to do nothing has passed. To avert catastrophe, the governments of the world must work together to change the system of government and business as we know it. Carbon must be treated as a pollutant and taxed accordingly. As business operations change to make use of more sustainable and environmentally friendly resources, the tax could be reduced, so that companies are rewarded for going green. Incentives for doing the right thing must be introduced, but penalties for contributing to the destruction of the planet must also be in place.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Pollutants such as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are impacting the climate and will only get worse without significant, radical and substantial changes to policies and current systems. The way businesses operate needs to change to eliminate greenhouse gases from their processes completely. Regulators have a massive role to play in changing the way these practices are allowed to continue, and why. Governments must work together to create a joined up approach to changing the way businesses operate and reward those that change, and punish those that refuse to take responsibility for their impacts on our planet. Task 3: English Group 3 completed this task, reading an article from the website, Globalnews.ca:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is undeniable that carbon emissions are one of the main contributing factors to global warming and climate change. The time for governments to do nothing has passed. To avert catastrophe, the governments of the world must work together to change the system of government and business as we know it. Carbon must be treated as a pollutant and taxed accordingly. As business operations change to make use of more sustainable and environmentally friendly resources, the tax could be reduced, so that companies are rewarded for going green.
