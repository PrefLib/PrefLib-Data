# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The issue of overpopulation is not a straightforward one. It is a very difficult problem to solve, and it is not one that can be dealt with easily, or in the short term. It is a global problem, and it has many different causes, including the increase in lifespan, the decrease in deaths, the increase in birth rate, immigration, and so on. The world is becoming overpopulated, and this will cause huge problems for the planet, including increased poverty, a decrease in non-renewable resources, pollution, and so on. The current situation cannot continue. The overpopulation problem must be dealt with.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that our planet is overpopulated, we have reached our optimum population capacity. There is a wide range of reasons for this, including the increase in lifespan, the decrease in deaths, the increase in birth rate, immigration, etc. All of this results in an overpopulation problem, and it is only getting worse. This will cause huge problems for the planet, including increased poverty, a decrease in non-renewable resources, pollution, and so on. The current situation cannot continue. The overpopulation problem must be dealt with. It is difficult to do so, because there are a lot of people, and it is difficult to control the birth rate, as well as immigration. It is a very difficult problem to deal with, and it is not one that can be dealt with easily, or in the short term.
