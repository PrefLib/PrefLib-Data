# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - While alcohol is legal and many people enjoy it responsibly, it is important to acknowledge that alcohol can be harmful if it is abused and is a known risk factor for a number of health problems. Advertising of alcohol should therefore not be encouraged, as it may lead to increased use of alcohol. Any adverts for alcohol should include a risk statement to draw attention to the fact that alcohol is a health risk, particularly if abused. The advert should also include the fact that there are restrictions on its sale, for example it should only be sold to people over 18 years old, and that it should not be consumed before driving or operating machinery.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There is nothing wrong with advertising alcohol. Adverts should not be aimed at underage drinkers. Adverts should not be shown on television before 9pm. Adverts should not glamorise drinking alcohol. Adverts should include a risk statement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Alcohol advertising is a complex issue and one that has been widely debated. We do not feel that alcohol advertising should be banned outright as there is evidence that people are aware of alcohol and its effects without advertising. However, the advertising of alcohol should be restricted in places where it is likely to be seen by children and young people. There should be no advertising of alcohol on television before 9pm and alcohol advertising should not be allowed on social media platforms. There should also be some health warnings on alcohol adverts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be some restrictions on advertising alcohol. The group felt that advertising alcohol is not wrong in principle, but that there should be some restrictions on the content of the adverts and where they are placed. The group felt that there should be some restrictions on the content of the adverts and where they are placed.
