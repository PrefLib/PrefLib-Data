# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I am wary of allowing private companies to sell services as part of the NHS, as I believe it leads to a lack of transparency, competition and can increase corruption. I do not trust that private companies will operate inline with the guidance and values of the spirit of the NHS, instead choosing to put profit before people. This would have a hugely detrimental impact on the way the NHS is currently run. I will admit that the NHS is not perfect at the moment, and could be better in many different ways; most importantly through being more efficient with less layers of management structures. Private companies that want to work within the sphere of the NHS should not be trusted without extensive scrutiny and gaining an understanding of their motives. We do, however, believe that private companies could provide services to the NHS if they are willing to show their books and operate transparently. This would provide a new source of funding to the NHS, which could be used to provide better services for patients, and would also provide competition in the sector, which could lead to lower prices for patients. This would require a lot of regulation to ensure that private companies are operating within the spirit of the NHS, and are not being allowed to take advantage of the system.”

It is also important to note that private companies are not always synonymous with profit-making, and there is no intrinsic difference between public and private companies. The only difference is ownership and this is also not that meaningful as private companies are incentivized to maximize profits. What is important is whether a company is acting in the spirit of the NHS.”
