# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Companies should be required to publish the salaries of employees, or at least the salaries of employees above a certain threshold. This would allow for greater transparency in salaries and help employees to identify whether they are being underpaid. However, publishing salaries of employees would also give competitors an advantage and could lead to poaching of employees.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the salaries of employees should be published, at least for employees above a certain threshold. The threshold would be determined by the organisation in question. The threshold could be set at a level where it would not cause disruption to the business or harm to the employee. The salaries should be published to the public, however, the organisation in question should have the option to choose the level of detail in which the salaries are published, for example, it could choose to publish a range of salaries, rather than an exact figure.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We agree that companies should be required to publish the salaries of employees, or at least the salaries of employees above a certain threshold. This is to ensure transparancy about the salaries of people at the top of organisations. However, it depends on the organisation. For example, this has been a disaster at the BBC as commerical competitors now know exactly how much to offer their staff to tempt them away to work for them. So it depends on the organisation and the status of the employees.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Companies should be required to publish the salaries of employees above a certain threshold. The threshold should be set at a high level, e.g. £100k, to avoid the publication of the salaries of people at the bottom of organisations. The publication of salaries will help to ensure the salaries of people at the top of organisations are fair. It may also help to identify imbalance in earnings between workers, especially for high earners.
