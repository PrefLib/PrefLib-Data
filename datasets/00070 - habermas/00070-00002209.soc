# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We feel that patients should be given more say over their care in the NHS. The most important thing in the health service is the care of the patient, and we feel that there needs to be a greater emphasis on this. Communication between staff, patients and carers needs to be improved, and we feel that this can only be achieved through staff becoming more open to the suggestions and input of patients and carers. It is not enough for staff to just do what they are told, but it is important for them to question why certain procedures are being done and whether there is a better way of doing things.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the NHS is well run and provides good care to its patients. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, communication between staff and patients needs to be improved. Patients often feel that they are not being listened to and that their problems are not being taken seriously. Secondly, more training is needed for staff to deal with patients with disabilities. This is because these patients often feel that they are not being treated with the same level of care as able-bodied patients. Finally, more training is needed for staff to deal with mental health issues. The stigma around mental health is still very much alive and patients are often treated differently to those with physical health problems.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the NHS is well run and has well trained staff.  It is free at the point of use and therefore accessible to all.  It is also the largest employer in the UK.  It is also the case that the NHS is constantly underfunded and understaffed.  There are many areas where the NHS could be improved, but these are often beyond the control of those working in the NHS.  For example, the UK has one of the lowest rates of organ donation in Europe.  This is because the UK has an opt-in system for organ donation, whereas many other countries have an opt-out system.  This means that many organs that could be used for donation are not, and many people die while waiting for a transplant.  Another area that could be improved is the level of training that staff receive.  For example, there are many conditions that are very rare, but that are life-threatening.  Staff are often not trained to deal with these conditions, and patients can be left feeling very alone.  There are also many conditions that are not life-threatening, but that can have a huge impact on a person's quality of life.  These conditions are often not taken seriously by the
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although the NHS is run by a budget and we understand that this is vital to its smooth running, the care of patients should be the number one priority and communication between patients and those that run the 'business' needs to be improved. This will result in more say over patients' care, a reduced stigma against mental illness, and hopefully a reduction in the suicide rate in the UK.
