# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Businesses should not be required to allow workers to take more holidays. If employees feel they are overworked, then they should be given the option of working from home or working part time. This would allow employees to work in a way that suits them and would also allow them to spend more time with their families.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Businesses should not be required to allow their employees to take more holidays. The number of holidays should be based on the length of service and the performance of the employee. Businesses should allow their employees to take holidays at times when it is convenient for them and the business. The employee should be given incentives for good performance and for working extra hours.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Some companies should allow their employees to take more holidays if they feel they can manage the work load. The employees should also be able to offer ways of coping with the extra time off and may include working longer hours at quieter times throughout the year.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We think businesses should be allowed to allow their workers to have more holidays if the employees have worked for a considerable time with the company and have been performing well in their roles. The extra holidays could be an incentive for staff to stay with that company. If businesses choose to offer this to their staff it is essential that they do not risk the overall company by having too many staff members away at once. It is important to understand that a person needs a break from work every so often to keep their minds refreshed. A fresh mind will be able to work more efficiently and so a business can only benefit from this.
