# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Most local authorities are doing enough to encourage cycling. The problem is that there is not enough money in the pot to improve existing infrastructure and create new cycle paths. There needs to be a greater emphasis on cycling to school for children and incentives for this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Local authorities are doing enough to encourage cycling. Some cities have better cycling infrastructure than others, however most are getting better. Sometimes the implementation of this infrastructure is not great, as cycle lanes often end randomly, and sometimes are not well maintained which results in cyclists using the road with cars. We should focus more on completing and maintaining cycling infrastructure before continuing to make new, partial cycle paths. However, generally speaking we think most local authorities seem to push quite a lot to encourage people to cycle.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We agree that local authorities are doing enough to encourage cycling, but think that more could be done to encourage recycling. There are often clear instructions on what can be recycled, but people are often too lazy to bother. We think recycling should be more centralised and publicised. Local authorities often organise many schemes to encourage cycling, but there is little awareness of them. We think that local authorities could make these more clear and centralise their efforts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, yes, local authorities are doing enough to encourage cycling. They are putting in place good infrastructure for cyclists, and making people aware of the benefits of cycling. However, there is more that can be done. Cycle lanes should be maintained and kept clear of debris and parked cars, and cycle lanes should be extended to connect different areas, so that cyclists do not have to use the road.
