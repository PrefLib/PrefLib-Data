# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe we are in the midst of a climate crisis. Climate change is the long-term effect of increasing the average temperature of the Earth and rising sea levels. Global climate change is leading to more extreme weather events. It is caused by human activities and is linked to global warming. There is a clear link between global warming and rising sea levels. This is due to the melting of ice caps. If sea levels continue to rise, it will cause a loss of habitat for many marine species and pose a risk to low-lying coastal areas. There is also a risk that the climate crisis will worsen, as higher temperatures will speed up the melting of polar ice caps. Therefore, humans must take drastic action to reduce greenhouse gases. Governments around the world must act now and implement rules to force big corporations to be more planet friendly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We are in the midst of a climate crisis. The rate at which the climate is changing has been picking up pace over the past few decades, we've been seeing heat waves in place that are generally cold, and cold weather in desert area's that generally don't see much cold weather. The earth climate is changing due to human activities. This is an increase in green house gas emissions. Extreme weather have become more frequent. These changes have worst effects on humans, eco system and quality of life. Governments need to take action now and implement rules to force big corporations to be more planet friendly. The monopoly of rich countries and companies on the resources should be challenged to get out of the climate crisis. The sea has been decimated to almost the point of no return, which has a huge affect on the climate. Unfortunately I think things are too advanced and governments aren't willing to crack down on companies causing these issues and instead focus on getting people to turn off their lights. If everyone in the UK had their lights on 24/7 for a year I doubt it would even touch what China does in a day.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Climate change is the most important challenge facing humanity. We need to make a change now to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. This was a difficult topic for people to reach a consensus view on, but after a lot of debate and a vote the group managed to agree on a statement. The vote was 2 in favour, 2 against and 1 abstention.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe we are in the midst of a climate crisis. Climate change is the long-term trend of average weather, caused by the accumulation of human-induced emissions. The rate at which climate is changing has increased over the past few decades. This rate of change is also speeding up, as human activity increases the number of green house gases in the atmosphere. This rate of change in temperature has had a knock-on effect on the earths eco-systems, as the climate becomes increasingly unpredictable. For example, heat waves are becoming more common, droughts are lasting longer, and ice caps are melting. We believe that the only way to fight this is for governments to act on their promises, and increase the rate at which green house gases are reduced, before it is too late.
