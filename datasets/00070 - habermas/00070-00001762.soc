# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We are all against this idea as we feel it would give the wealthy a big advantage. We feel that money should not play a part in the justice system. Although the government needs money for public services, they should be getting this money from another way that would not allow the rich to benefit over the poor. We feel that each case should be looked at on its own merit and not affected by money. We also discussed the idea of using private prisons, and how this could lead to companies saving money by not taking care of the prisoners. Although this is something we feel would work in the UK, it would not work in the US, because they have the death penalty and the prisoners would not have the same rights.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should not be allowed to pay for faster criminal justice procedures. The justice system should be equal for all. This would create a two-tiered system which would benefit the rich. It would result in longer waiting times for poorer people. Concerns about due process and potential manipulation of the legal process by those with financial means also arise. Balancing efficiency and fairness while upholding the principles of a just legal system would require careful consideration and public debate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, This is something that is dealt with on a merit by merit basis and should not be aBLE TO BE INFLUENCED BY MONEY
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We are in favour of allowing people to pay for faster criminal justice procedures. This will not allow for a two tier justice system as it would only be applied on a case by case basis. Furthermore, this is an ideal way to raise revenue for the government as it is something that has been suggested by a lot of private companies.
