# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Inequality in society is increasing and there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor. This can be seen in wages, housing and many other areas of society. The effects of this inequality are being felt by people of all classes and ages. The government is not doing enough to address the growing inequality gap in the UK. We believe that inequality needs to be addressed more and we suggest the following steps:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, the government is not doing enough to address the inequality gap. Although austerity has negatively impacted all sections of society, its effect has been disproportionately worse on the poorest. Therefore, we think that the government needs to reduce austerity measures and increase funding to public services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe the government is not doing enough to address the growing inequality gap. They are not being radical enough and are relying too much on the charity sector and individualised behaviour change. It needs to be a political issue, it needs to be raised in parliament and the government needs to accept the responsibility of having created the environment that led to it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government is not doing enough to address the growing inequality gap and needs to make a greater effort to introduce more progressive taxation and equal pay policies for women and minorities.
