# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of making parenting classes mandatory. They felt that parenting is something that comes naturally to most people and that making the classes mandatory would infringe on people's rights. They did concede, however, that there are some parents who may benefit from the classes and that they should be available to those who want them. They also felt that the classes should be free of charge.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of parents being required to attend training on how to bring up children. The participants felt that this would help to reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect, and would also improve the child's well-being. It was also felt that the training would help parents to improve their parenting skills, and this would help to enhance the parent-child relationship. The participants felt that it was important to ensure that the training was not too prescriptive, and that it allowed for some flexibility, as each family is different, and has different needs. The participants also felt that it was important to ensure that the training was not too expensive, as this would prevent poorer families from being able to attend. The participants also felt that it was important to ensure that the training was accessible to all parents, and this could be achieved by providing the training in a range of different locations, and at different times.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Parenting is a challenging and often difficult task.  Many parents have the best intentions for their children but find it hard to know what the best way is to parent and bring up their children.  It would be useful for parents to attend training to help them learn about how to raise children.  It is not practical to think that there is only one way to raise a child, but it would be useful for parents to have a framework and a basic understanding of how to meet the emotional and practical needs of their children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Parenting is a tough job, it is a full-time job and it comes with no salary and no breaks. Parents should be supported in any way possible. We feel that parents would benefit from being given a few days training on how to raise their children. This would allow them to have a basic understanding of how to feed, discipline and relate to their child in the correct way. Parents would be able to take advantage of many benefits, such as being able to understand how to relate to their child when they are going through tough times.  It would also allow parents to understand the correct way to feed their child, which is very important as the number of obese children is increasing.  There are also many benefits for the child. Their parents will understand how to support their child's emotional needs and provide them with a secure attachment style.
