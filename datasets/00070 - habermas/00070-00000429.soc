# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should do more to combat climate change as it will affect the quality of life of future generations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Climate change is real and something that is happening in our world. It is causing floods, hurricanes, and many other weather disasters. It is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. Governments, big businesses, and individuals need to do more to fight climate change and stop it. The only way to do that is by moving to renewable energy sources and cutting out the use of fossil fuels. More should be done to educate the public on the seriousness of climate change and the effects it is having on our world and what we can do to stop it.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in agreement that climate change was a significant problem, and that human activity is a major cause. The group disagreed as to the impact on the climate that this activity was having. The group agreed that not enough was being done to combat climate change, and that all people, not just governments, should be doing more. The group agreed that there are many simple steps that can be taken to combat climate change, such as reducing driving, recycling, and eating less meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that we should be doing more to combat climate change. We have already seen extreme weather events around the world, which are having devastating impacts on people's lives and livelihoods. Such events are being caused by the build up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and global temperatures are increasing as a result. Governments around the world must come together and take drastic steps to cut carbon emissions and move to renewable energy sources. People can also help by recycling, and making efforts to reduce their carbon footprint.
