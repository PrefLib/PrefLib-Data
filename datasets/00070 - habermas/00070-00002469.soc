# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of fining people for not voting in elections. The general feeling was that people should have the right to choose whether or not they want to vote and should not be forced to do so. However, the group also felt that the government should make it easier for people to vote, perhaps by making polling stations more accessible. The group also felt that the government should encourage people to vote and perhaps even make it a civic duty to do so. The group felt that a small fine might be worth it but it should only be small, perhaps in line with peoples wages.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should not fine people who do not vote in elections. The government should make it easier for people to vote. The government should also make it a civic duty to vote. In Australia if you do not vote you are fined and participation is over 80%. A small fine might be worth it but it should only be small, perhaps in line with peoples wages. People have the right to vote if they please, not if the government pleases. It forces us to pick the best out of a bad bunch. As a democratic country it is highly important to have freedom. Freedom of speech, freedom of government control and also freedom for our actions. Whilst the government is set up to govern and support our growth, it is imperative that they do not have full control and we, as citizens can fully choose our own actions and choose to vote only if we want to do so. Citizens should not be penalized or fined for simply not voting. it is a human right to have freedom. We would be more like a dictatorship controlled government if people were fined for not voting.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to fining citizens who do not vote. The group felt that it was important to preserve freedom of choice, and that if citizens were fined for not voting, it would create a sense of resentment and could lead to a dictatorship. The group felt that it was the government’s responsibility to encourage citizens to vote, and to make it easier for them to do so. The group felt that it was important to educate citizens on the importance of voting and the impact it can have on their lives. The group felt that it was important for citizens to vote, but that it should be their own choice to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to fining people who did not vote. The group believed that people should have the right to vote if they pleased, not if the government pleased. It was believed that fining people who did not vote would be an erosion of freedom of individuals and democracy itself. The group believed that the government should make it easier for people to vote and make it a civic duty to do so. It was also believed that forcing people to vote would make people vote for the wrong reasons and this could skew any relevant data. A small fine might be worth it but it should only be small, perhaps in line with peoples wages.
