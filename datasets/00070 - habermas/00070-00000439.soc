# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should spend the same on both, they are both of equal importance to the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the budget for the NHS.  However, as participant 3 said, we can’t forget about our defences as our enemies have not gone away and we must continue to be vigilant and ensure our country is well defended.  It is a balance, but in the end the NHS is more important for the health and wellbeing of our country, so more needs to be spent on this and less on defence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “The NHS is the cornerstone of the UK and is one of the things that make the UK great.  We must protect the NHS and continue to support advances in medicines whatever the cost.  The defence budget needs to be amended so that the NHS gets the finances it needs.  There is no point in defending our country if we have no NHS.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The NHS is a vital part of the UK. The health and wellbeing of the nation should be prioritised and the NHS should receive more funding from the government than the defence budget.
