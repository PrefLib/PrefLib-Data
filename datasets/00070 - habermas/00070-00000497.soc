# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be some ban on certain websites, but this should be done very carefully. Websites should be taken down when they are used to encourage sexual crime. Also, websites that encourage suicide and self-harm should be taken down. The resources used to police this would be a good investment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should have the power to remove certain websites from the internet where there is sufficient justification for doing so, such as sites containing inappropriate or harmful content that is likely to cause offence, distress or harm.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should not ban certain websites from the internet. It is very important to protect freedom of speech and freedom of expression.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the internet should remain an open platform. However, in cases where content is illegal, such as revenge porn, scam websites, or violence against people, the government should have the right to shut down the website and block the website from being accessed by people in the country.
