# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Universities should not be allowed to increase their tuition fees to any level they want. Universities should have some guidelines that they must follow when increasing fees. They should also be required to justify why they are increasing their fees. If they are not required to do this, it will discriminate against poorer students who will not be able to afford to enrol in the courses they want to. Universities should be representative of all of society not just the ones who are the most well off.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Universities should not be allowed to increase their tuition fees to any level they want. The government should set guidelines that all universities have to follow and they should have to justify charging any higher fees. If this is not done then some students from poorer backgrounds will not be able to enrol in the courses they want to.  Universities should be representative of all of society not just the ones who are the most well off.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, Universities should not be allowed to increase their tuition fees to any level they want.  The government should set guidelines that all universities have to follow and they should have to justify charging any higher fees.  If this is not done then some students from poorer backgrounds will not be able to enrol in the courses they want to.  Universities should be representative of all of society not just the ones who are the most well off.
