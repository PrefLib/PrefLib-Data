# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, wind turbines should not be banned on the UK's shoreline. We need to be diversifying our energy resources as much as possible and wind energy is a vital part of this. If we continue to be dependent on other countries energy supplies we will suffer from fluctuations in the market due to conflicts or shortages. We also need to be investing more in wind as it is commonly understood to be a green source of energy. We must use more green energy sources if we are to have any hope of reducing our emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change. However, there are some issues that need to be considered. Firstly, the turbines can be an eyesore, and secondly, there is a risk that they can affect wildlife, especially birds. Therefore, when a wind farm is being proposed, the local community should have a say in whether the turbines are built. It is important to make sure that any wind turbines that are built on shorelines are far enough away from wildlife nesting sites, and if they do get in the way of birds migratory routes, then there needs to be some kind of warning system put in place, to warn the birds of the turbines.

Firstly, the turbines can be an eyesore, and secondly, there is a risk that they can affect wildlife, especially birds. The second issue can be mitigated by ensuring that the turbines are a sufficient distance from land so that birds are not put at risk. The other issue can be mitigated by ensuring that the turbines are not too close to land and also by making sure that they are well designed and blend in well with the environment.

Firstly, the turbines can be an eyesore, and secondly, there is a risk that they can affect wildlife, especially birds. The first issue is relatively easily solved by only putting turbines in places where they cannot be seen from land. This is a compromise that is necessary in order to get the most from wind energy. The second issue is more complex. Further research is needed to find out more about how they can affect wildlife, and whether this can be mitigated. If it cannot, then it will need to be weighed up against the benefits of wind energy.

It is important that the location of the turbines is considered, and where possible they are placed further away from populated areas. It is also important to consider the flight paths of birds and other wildlife, and avoid putting turbines in areas that they may be flying over.
