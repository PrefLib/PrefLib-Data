# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Brexit was not the right decision and the benefits will not outweigh the costs.  In particular, the participants were very concerned with the immediate changes the man on the street can see.  They all felt that Brexit was supposed to firm up the borders, and that has not happened.  It has instead drastically delayed passengers and cargo on either side of the Channel, and pulled any easy free trade and cooperation away from many firms.  It was supposed to allow us to reduce the cost the European project was demanding of us, and no benefit has been seen there.  It was supposed to allow us our own human rights laws without the pressure of European ideas, and no change has been made on that front at all.  The benefits - of not spending money on developing Eastern European countries, and having a hard border as regards boat people - have not started to happen.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The Brexit project has not been a success, and the benefits of the project are not going to outweigh the costs.  The immediate changes the man on the street can see are not good, and the promised benefits of Brexit have not materialised.  The borders have not been firmed up, and instead have been made less efficient.  The cost of the European project has not been reduced, and the project has not been made more effective.  Human rights laws have not been improved, and instead have become less fair and less equal.  The promised benefits of Brexit - of not spending money on developing Eastern European countries, and having a hard border as regards boat people - have not started to happen.
