# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should celebrate the life of Sir Winston Churchill.  It is a commonly held belief that he is the best Prime Minister we have ever had and I believe having him as Prime Minister during the war years certainly helped us win the War.  I know he was held responsible for some mistakes made during the First World War, I believe, but at least he did make decisions.  We should celebrate Winston Churchill based upon his accomplishments, taking us as a country through WWII. I do not believe the racist connotations should be admired though as this does not reflect society in today's image.  Therefore, taking into consideration the views of both Churchill and the members of his team we have come to the following view. We do not condone the racist behaviour demonstrated by Sir Winston Churchill. However we should celebrate him and the positive outcomes he brought for our country as a result of his decision making skills, crucial at the time during both wars.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a day for remembering Winston Churchill. Winston Churchill led the country during times of national need during World War 2 when he stood against forces like the Nazis, instilled national pride and brought the nation together. Despite all of the challenges, Britain survived thanks to Churchill. Even though Churchill held racist views which is the worst thing anyone can believe and reflects a prejudice and bias- this doesn’t reflect modern values and so, when remembering Churchill for his strengths, he cannot be judged on the whole scope of modernity, rather the context and period of history. Today, discrimination should be stamped out, as it is unlawful in Britain as everyone is equal regardless of race or ethnicity. That is what freedom means. Even though as the member from our group notes we should not always remember just his positives, this cannot prevent from people respecting what he did for his country, people should not always be forgotten in their past just for one deed. Having said this, judging his racism is fair in reflection of modern social policy and how people can no longer act and behave in this way- otherwise we could not forget other groups of people in modernity who would suffer from his bigotry; gays and lesbians, Muslims and
