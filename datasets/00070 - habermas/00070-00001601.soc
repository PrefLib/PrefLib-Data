# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that May was a poor Prime Minister. While her passion and dedication to the position of Prime Minister was admirable, her time as PM had significant consequences which have affected the UK as a whole. She failed to produce a Brexit deal which could get through Parliament, resulting in a longer period of uncertainty which has affected UK businesses and people living in the UK. Additionally, her poor leadership caused significant infighting within the Conservative Party which undermined the government’s authority. Overall, we believe that May was a poor Prime Minister, whose legacy has had a significant negative impact on the UK.
