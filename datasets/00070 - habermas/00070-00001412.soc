# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group came to the consensus view that high earners should be taxed more to help fund the NHS because the more wealth you have, the more you can afford to pay and the NHS needs more funding to help prevent it from failing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We all agreed that the NHS is very important to us all. We felt that it is very important that it receives the funds it needs to operate effectively and that it is well managed. We felt that taxes should be raised on high earners as they are most able to pay more tax and because the NHS needs the funds. However, we felt that a limit should be placed on the amount of tax high earners should pay. We did not all agree on what that limit should be. We felt that it would be good if high earners pay a higher percentage of their income in tax than lower earners. However, we felt that they should not be expected to pay so much more that they are no longer motivated to work hard. We felt that the more motivated people are to work hard, the better it is for everyone. We felt that if everyone works hard and strives for success, this would benefit everyone, including those in the lower income brackets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the UK should raise taxes on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service. The NHS is in dire straits and needs additional funding. People earning a lot of money are most able to cope with a higher tax burden and a better funded NHS would benefit everyone in society. A tax rise for high earners should be limited to a level that is fair and would not produce negative effects. We also believe that the gap between the rich and the poor is simply getting bigger, so paying more tax would make things fairer. Also, more happier countries in the world pay more tax, so it is in our interests to ensure richer people pay more tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a tax rise for people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service. The tax rise should be fair and not produce negative effects.
