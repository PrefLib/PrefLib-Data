# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children under the age of 12 should be allowed to walk home from school on their own, as long as they have the necessary knowledge and skills to do so safely. Parents and guardians should teach children the skills required to walk home from school safely, including how to keep themselves safe from physical and emotional harm, the potential dangers they may face, how to respond to a potential threat, how to contact emergency services, and how to use public transport. It is the parents' responsibility to make the decision, taking into account the child's readiness for independent travel, the specific circumstances that could pose a potential threat, and how effective the knowledge and skills learnt by the child are at ensuring their safety.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children under the age of 12 should be allowed to walk home from school on their own, as long as they have the necessary knowledge and skills to do so safely. Parents and guardians should teach children the skills required to walk home from school safely, including how to keep themselves safe from physical and emotional harm, the potential dangers they may face, how to respond to a potential threat, and how to use public transport. It is the parents' responsibility to make the decision, taking into account the child's readiness for independent travel and the specific circumstances that could pose a potential threat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final consensus statement: While recognising that some children may not be ready to walk home from school on their own, children under the age of 12 should be allowed to walk home from school on their own, as long as they have the necessary knowledge and skills to do so safely. Parents and guardians should teach children the skills required to walk home from school safely, including how to keep themselves safe from physical and emotional harm, the potential dangers they may face, how to respond to a potential threat, and how to use public transport.  Allowing children under the age of 12 to walk home from school on their own will help them to develop a sense of independence and foster personal growth. However, parents must consider the level of readiness and skills of each child on an individual basis. Ultimately, parents are responsible for making the decision.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children under the age of 12 should be allowed to walk home from school on their own, as long as they have the necessary knowledge and skills to do so safely. Parents and guardians should teach children the skills required to walk home from school safely, including how to keep themselves safe from physical and emotional harm, the potential dangers they may face, how to respond to a potential threat, and how to use public transport. It is the parents' responsibility to make the decision, taking into account the child's readiness for independent travel and the specific circumstances that could pose a potential threat. It is also the responsibility of the parents to help children develop the necessary skills and knowledge to ensure their safety when walking home from school.
