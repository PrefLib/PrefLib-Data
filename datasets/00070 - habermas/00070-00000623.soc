# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that it is acceptable for companies to pay employees less than minimum wage as long as the company provides them with subsidized meals and housing. The meals and housing must be of a good quality and the employee must be made aware of the costs of meals and housing. This must be made clear in the employee contract and must be something that the employee is happy with. The employee must also be made aware that they can leave the job at any time and they will not be charged for meals and housing. However, the company must ensure that the employee is not being exploited, that they are receiving a wage which will allow them to live a comfortable life.

We believe that companies should pay their employees the minimum wage and if they cannot afford to do so, they should not be hiring employees.
