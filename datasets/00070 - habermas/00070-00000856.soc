# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to government intervention in the food choices of individuals. The group felt that people should have the right to choose what they eat, and that the government should not have the right to intervene in this area. However, the group did agree that the government should provide more support to those who struggle to afford healthy foods. The group felt that the government could provide food vouchers for those who cannot afford to buy healthy foods, and that the government could also provide support to food banks and other charities that provide healthy foods for those who cannot afford them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should not intervene to change food choices. This is because the people who make these choices should be free to choose what they want to eat. If they want to eat junk food then they should be free to do so. The government should not force people to eat healthy food as this is a violation of their freedom. However, the government should take steps to make healthy food more affordable and accessible. This could be done by subsidising the cost of healthy food or by introducing vouchers that can be used to buy healthy food.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of government intervention to change food choices. It was felt that this was a personal choice and that people should be free to choose what they eat. However, it was felt that there is a problem with the cost of healthy food being more expensive than unhealthy food and that this should be addressed. It was also felt that the government should do more to promote healthy eating and to provide information on healthy eating.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the government intervening to change food choices. The group was in favour of the idea that people should be free to choose what they eat and that this freedom should not be taken away. The group did not believe that the government would be able to successfully implement a plan to change food choices. The group believed that this would be too difficult to implement and would be too expensive. The group did, however, believe that the government should be doing more to help people who struggle to afford healthy foods. The group believed that this could be done by giving people healthy eating food vouchers.
