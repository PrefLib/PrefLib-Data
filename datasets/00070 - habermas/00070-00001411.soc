# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe the tax rate should be raised for high earners. If they earn a lot, then the government can use that money for various other services that need funding. The rate should be raised by 10%, making the tax rate on income over £200,000 at 40%. However, we do not think the rate should be raised any further, as this would provide disincentive for workers to work hard.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of raising the tax rate on higher earners. They felt that it was unfair that some people were able to earn so much money, while others were unable to earn enough to live on. They also felt that if people were able to earn a lot of money, they should be willing to give some of it back to the community. They felt that this would be a fair way of redistributing wealth. The group felt that the current tax rate of 40% was too high, and that it should be lowered to 35%. They felt that this would be a fairer way of taxing people, and would also be more likely to be accepted by the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It was thought that the tax rate on higher earners could be raised, but only under certain conditions. The group thought that those earning more than a certain amount of money, probably around £200,000 per year, should be taxed more highly. It was felt that this was a reasonable amount to live on and therefore, anything more should be taxed at a higher rate. However, the participants did not think that the tax rate should be too high, as there would be no incentive for people to work hard and do well. The group thought that if a person is a hard worker and spends all their money, it should be seen as more acceptable than someone who stores their wealth in a savings account and does not put money back into the economy. The group thought that raising the tax rate on higher earners was fair, but thought that it should be done carefully and gradually.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the tax rate should not be raised on higher earners. This is because there is a significant risk that it will reduce the incentive to work hard and make money, and also because there is no guarantee that the money will be spent in a way that stimulates the economy. However, if the money is not spent in a way that stimulates the economy, the government should consider taxing the money that is stored in savings accounts.
