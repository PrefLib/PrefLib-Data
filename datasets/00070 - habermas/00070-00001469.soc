# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: In general, the group was in favour of a ban on the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad. However, this would be difficult to enforce, and would not be a long-term solution to the problem. The group felt that it was important for the government to put pressure on foreign governments to improve the working conditions of their workers. The group also felt that the government should make it a legal requirement for all companies to have their products independently inspected to ensure that they are not being made by underpaid workers. __________________________ If you would like help structuring a written component for your task, please refer to this link. https://www.dropbox.com/s/g7e0vvji7jl1jez/Case%20Study%20Assignment%20Guide%20%28Complete%29%281%29.pdf?dl=0 If you want some tips on how to construct a discussion component for your task, please refer to this link. https://www.dropbox.com/s/z0dja3wmufhc3h7/Case%20Study%20Assignment%20Guide%20%28Complete%29%282%29.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a legal requirement for all companies to have their products independently inspected to ensure that they are not being made by underpaid workers. The government should also put pressure on foreign governments to improve the working conditions of their workers. In the future, we should look at implementing a ban on the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be some legislation in place to ban the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad. However, this may be difficult to enforce, and it will not be a long-term solution to the problem. There are many different standards of living in different countries, and so what is considered to be underpaid may vary from country to country. It is important for the government to put pressure on foreign governments to improve the working conditions of their workers. It should be a legal requirement for all companies to have their products independently inspected to ensure that they are not being made by underpaid workers. The government should also be aware of the supply chains of the products that are being sold in the UK, in order to guard against labour exploitation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of a ban on the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad. However, it was recognised that this would be difficult to enforce, and would not be a long-term solution to the problem. It was also recognised that there are many different standards of living in different countries, and so what is considered to be underpaid may vary from country to country. The group felt that it was important for the government to put pressure on foreign governments to improve the working conditions of their workers. The group also felt that the government should make it a legal requirement for all companies to have their products independently inspected to ensure that they are not being made by underpaid workers. The group recommended the use of these inspections as a first step towards the abolition of these practices abroad, with the understanding that these inspections could eventually be replaced by independent audits that ensure the products are being manufactured under acceptable working conditions.
