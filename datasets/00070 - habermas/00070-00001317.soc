# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, the sale of human organs on the free market shouldn't be allowed as it is immoral to do so. It also encourages black market activity where people in less fortunate situations feel pressured to give up their organs to make ends meet. This is dangerous and can be exploited by rich people who can offer money to buy a kidney as an example. The current setup where human organs are only obtained from deceased individuals is the way to go until artificial organs can be manufactured.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “We don’t believe that the sale of human organs should be allowed on the free market as the act of selling organs and being in such a dire situation where you have to sell an organ are extremely sad and the act of selling human organs is simply unethical. Many people may sell their organs because they are in desperate need of money and this may lead to them selling more than one organ and it may also encourage people to steal human organs from people and sell them on the black market which may result in the organ becoming damaged or damaged to the point of being unsellable. A black market for human organs may also make it harder for people who require transplants as it may lead to the body parts being harvested from the deceased becoming less available or they may end up being sold on the black market instead of going to people who need it. We believe that selling organs should not be allowed until it has been through with and we have ways to ensure it is safe.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not allow the sale of human organs on the free market, because it would not be fair to the less well off and some people would feel pressured into doing so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was against the sale of human organs on the free market. This is because it will lead to exploitation of the poor by the rich and also lead to black market activity. This is also unethical and against the law.
