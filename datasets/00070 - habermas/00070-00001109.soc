# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not wrong to use recreational drugs, if they are used sensibly. This will differ from person to person, and should be based on scientific research into the drugs in question, so that the individual can decide for themselves whether they would benefit from the use of that drug, and whether they can afford the financial cost, health costs, and other potential harms that might result.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The law should not prohibit victimless crimes. However it is important to educate people on the potentially harmful side effects of recreational drugs. People need to understand that there are some risks to their health and their social interactions. Some recreational drugs are not very safe to use and some can be highly addictive and people should be aware of the risks. Some recreational drugs are safer than others. It is wrong to use recreational drugs if you are pregnant and this is highly dangerous to the baby and could result in the child having serious medical problems. It is not a good idea to try drugs, even once, as you could become addicted. However it is up to the individual to decide for themselves if they wish to take recreational drugs. It is not for the law to tell people what to do and what not to do, especially if there is no victim. However, it is up to people to take responsibility for their own actions and understand the potential risks to themselves and their family and friends." Discussion:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the use of recreational drugs is wrong, but it is not always wrong to use recreational drugs. The use of recreational drugs can lead to addiction and other harms, but some people might have a legitimate need and it might really help them and they might not prevent a danger to themselves or anyone else. The use of recreational drugs is a choice, but the law should not punish victimless crimes, unless the result of those actions can have an effect on wider society. For example, crash helmets should be worn by motorcycle riders because of the protection they offer in the event of a crash, and the potential need for expensive hospital treatment if they are not worn. However while nothing is completely safe, drugs that are proven to be as safe as paracetamol, say, should not be restricted. There should also be a campaign of education regarding them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a distinction between illegal drugs and legal drugs. The use of legal drugs should be allowed as long as the person is old enough to make their own decisions and they do not become addicted to them. The use of illegal drugs should be punished. The punishment should not be severe, but it should be enough to deter people from using them.
