# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should increase the tax on air fares in the UK.  Air travel is a very expensive way to travel within the UK when other methods are available and better economically and environmentally.  It causes a huge amount of pollution to the environment and contributes a lot to global warming.  With the world effort on reducing carbon emissions and working towards slowing down ther impact on our environment air fares should deefinitely be increased globally.  The increased tax should then be used towards environmental projects to help offset the use of the air travel.  It would affect the consumer of course and could potentially impact the travel industry significantly depending on how high these taxes were but we won't have a planet to travel on if we don;t do something.  It is important that we increase the tax on the private jets and super rich who use air travel for luxury, not on the lower earners who need to fly to visit family and friends.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should increase the tax on air fares in the UK.  Air travel is a very expensive way to travel within the UK when other methods are available and better economically and environmentally.  It causes a huge amount of pollution to the environment and contributes a lot to global warming.  With the world effort on reducing carbon emissions and working towards slowing down ther impact on our environment air fares should deefinitely be increased globally.

It would affect the consumer of course and could potentially impact the travel industry significantly depending on how high these taxes were but we won't have a planet to travel on if we don;t do something.  However, it must be noted that any increase in tax would disproportionally impact lower income individuals who rely on air travel for essential purposes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should increase the tax on air fares in the UK.  Air travel is a very expensive way to travel within the UK when other methods are available and better economically and environmentally, so taxing should be increased.  It causes a huge amount of pollution to the environment and contributes a lot to global warming.  With the world effort on reducing carbon emissions and working towards slowing down ther impact on our environment air fares should deefinitely be increased globally.  The increased tax should then be used towards environmental projects to help offset the use of the air travel.  It would affect the consumer of course and could potentially impact the travel industry significantly depending on how high these taxes were but we won;t have a planet to travel on if we don;t do something.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should increase the tax on air fares in the UK.  Air travel is a very expensive way to travel within the UK when other methods are available and better economically and environmentally.  It causes a huge amount of pollution to the environment and contributes a lot to global warming.  With the world effort on reducing carbon emissions and working towards slowing down ther impact on our environment air fares should be increased globally.  The increased tax should then be used towards environmental projects to help offset the use of the air travel.  It would affect the consumer of course and could potentially impact the travel industry significantly depending on how high these taxes were but we won't have a planet to travel on if we don;t do something.  Air travel to holiday destinations will be impacted more than business travel.  A lot of business and government travel is done by plane to maintain the balance between time spent working and being at home.
