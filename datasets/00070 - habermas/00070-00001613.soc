# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: It would be a mistake to ban cryptocurrencies, as banning them would be a blow to free trade and innovation, and would likely only result in cryptocurrencies migrating elsewhere, to countries with less stringent financial regulations. Instead, the UK should establish and enforce laws regarding the legal use of cryptocurrencies, and use all its powers to prevent the illegal use of cryptocurrencies, so as to reduce the harm caused by their illegal use. The referendum result: 2 participants said 'Yes', 3 said 'No', and 1 participant said 'No view'.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While there have been problems with cryptocurrencies in the past, it would be a mistake to ban them, as banning them would be a blow to free trade and innovation, and would likely only result in cryptocurrencies migrating elsewhere, to countries with less stringent financial regulations. Instead, the UK should establish and enforce laws regarding the legal use of cryptocurrencies, and use all its powers to prevent the illegal use of cryptocurrencies, so as to reduce the harm caused by their illegal use. The UK should also make people more aware of the risks of cryptocurrencies, so that people don't get taken advantage of, and are not scammed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Cryptocurrencies should not be banned in the UK, but the government should implement and enforce laws regulating the legal use of cryptocurrencies and do everything in its power to reduce the harm caused by illegal use of cryptocurrencies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was wary of banning cryptocurrencies, since although they can be used for bad purposes, to ban them would be to take away their good uses as well, and to allow for new and exciting possibilities in the market. The group made the assertion that since cryptocurrencies have brought with them advantages and disadvantages, governments should instead regulate cryptocurrencies for a balance between freedom and security. Final consensus statement: While there have been problems with cryptocurrencies in the past, it would be a mistake to ban them, as banning them would be a blow to free trade and innovation, and would likely only result in cryptocurrencies migrating elsewhere, to countries with less stringent financial regulations. Instead, the UK should establish and enforce laws regarding the legal use of cryptocurrencies, and use all its powers to prevent the illegal use of cryptocurrencies, so as to reduce the harm caused by their illegal use.
