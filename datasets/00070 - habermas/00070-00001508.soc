# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should be allowed to use a limited number of drugs for recreational purposes, but they should be heavily regulated and subject to strict controls.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the legalisation of drugs. They felt that there was too great a risk of addiction and that the current approach to regulation of drugs was the best way to control the use of drugs in society. They did however acknowledge that the current approach to regulation of drugs was not working and that the use of drugs in society was increasing. They felt that the best way to combat this was to increase the penalties for trafficking in drugs and to increase the penalties for drug use. They felt that this would act as a greater deterrent to drug use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, drugs are harmful and should only be used as a last resort for medicinal purposes. Some studies however, have indicated that some drugs (like cannabis) could be beneficial for certain health conditions. However, the overall benefits of allowing recreational use of drugs need to be considered. It is possible that by legalising the use of certain drugs, it will prevent a black market and ultimately limit the amount of harm they cause to society. However, there is also a worry that by legalising drugs it would cause more harm by normalising their use and ultimately leading to the use of harder drugs.
