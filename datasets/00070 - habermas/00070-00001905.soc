# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Opinion from Group
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that the voting age should be raised to 18 as this is the age of adulthood and we feel that the younger people are, the less likely they are to be able to make an informed decision on who to vote for. We feel that 16/17 year olds are more likely to vote on impulse rather than making an informed decision. We feel that 18 year olds are more likely to have a better understanding of the world and are more likely to make an informed decision.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, the voting age should be raised to 18 as this is the age that a person is considered an adult in society. Furthermore, at 18 a person can make their own decisions and might have more interest in having a say as they might feel the impact of government decisions more so have better understanding on what they are voting for.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that the voting age should be raised to 18 as this is the age of adulthood in the UK. In a different group, the participants were asked to come up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
