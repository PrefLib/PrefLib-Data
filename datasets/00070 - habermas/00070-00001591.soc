# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the UK's NHS is better than in other countries. The NHS is free at the point of use, and this is a good model for health care. However, the NHS is currently underfunded, and this is having a negative impact on the quality of care that can be provided. Therefore, it is only better than in other countries because of the model that it is built on, rather than the quality of care that it provides. This is because the NHS is underfunded compared to other countries, which have insurance based systems. However, these systems have their own issues with access to care.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: In general, the UK's NHS is better than in other countries. The NHS is free at the point of use, and this is a good model for health care. However, the NHS is currently underfunded, and this is having a negative impact on the quality of care that can be provided. Therefore, it is only better than in other countries because of the model that it is built on, rather than the quality of care that it provides. OBSERVATIONS: I think this was a very good and balanced consensus opinion. The opinions in the original responses are all very different, and had conflicting (and sometimes unsupported) views on the quality of the NHS and comparison to health care in other countries. However, through careful listening and consideration of each other's opinions, the group were able to reach a balanced view that was positive in many ways, but at the same time acknowledged the current problems faced by the NHS and that these are only partly political. I was very pleased with how the debate went and think the consensus answer was very well thought out. The group were then asked to break up into groups based on their opinions (views), and to discuss each other's opinions
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is better than in other countries, because the NHS is free at the point of use, and this is a good model for health care. However, the NHS is currently underfunded, and this is having a negative impact on the quality of care that can be provided. Therefore, it is only better than in other countries because of the model that it is built on, rather than the quality of care that it provides. Even though the NHS is built on a good model, the lack of funding is having a negative impact on the quality of care, and so the NHS is only better than in other countries because of the model that it is built on, rather than the quality of care that it provides.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK's NHS is better than in other countries. However, it is not necessarily better in terms of outcomes, because of austerity and underfunding. It is only better in terms of its model, and in particular the fact that it is free at the point of use.
