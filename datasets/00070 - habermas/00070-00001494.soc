# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, parents should not be allowed to opt out of sex education classes for their children. This is because all children should be educated on this, otherwise parents will start opting out of all lessons as they choose to which would be chaos for schools. It is also important that all children are aware of the risks and consequences of sex, and how to protect themselves. If parents do not want their children to be educated on this, they should not have had children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of sex education classes being mandatory. The group felt that it was important for children to be educated on the topic, and that it was the responsibility of the school to ensure that children were educated on the topic. The group felt that the school would be able to provide a more comprehensive education on the topic than parents would be able to. The group felt that if children were not educated on the topic, it could lead to children being put in dangerous situations, or lead to teenage pregnancies. The group did acknowledge that in some cases it may be appropriate for parents to opt out of the classes. This may be in cases where the parents are teaching the children themselves, or in cases where the parents do not agree with the content of the sex education classes. The group felt that in these cases, the parents should be allowed to opt out, but that they should be required to provide the school with an alternative means of educating their child on the topic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “We don’t believe parents should be allowed to opt out of sex education for their children. Whilst we can understand the reasons for doing so, for example religious beliefs or wanting to teach their child themselves, the child’s needs come first. If a child does not receive the sex education at school, they will not know how to protect themselves and their bodies. This could have a massive impact on their mental health in later life. All children should have the right to be educated about sex in order to protect themselves and their health. Children should also be allowed to opt in to the classes if they want to, but it should be mandatory for them to be taught about it. If a child wishes to opt out of the classes, their parents must understand that the child will miss out on vital information.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - After a good debate, the group of participants came to the following consensus view:
1: 3,2,1,4
1: 1,2,3,4
1: 2,3,1,4
1: 4,3,2,1
1: 2,1,3,4
