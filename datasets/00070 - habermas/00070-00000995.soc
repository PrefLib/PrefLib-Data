# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was against the idea of a forced military service. Most of the participants thought that it would not be necessary to change the current model and that it was working fine as it was. A few participants thought that the military should be funded more and that there should be more of a presence in the world. However, the group in general thought that the current model of military service was fine and should not be changed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the UK's model of military service is fine and does not need to be changed. The current model allows people to join voluntarily and does not force anyone to join. The UK's military is a good thing and does a lot of good work in the world, cooperating with other countries. The UK military is also a strong presence in the world and has a good reputation. Forcing people to join the military would be a bad idea and would likely change peoples views of the military to a negative one.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK should not adopt a different model of military service. The UK's current military service model seems to be working fine as it is and anyone who has an interesting in joining can do so. The UK's military still has a strong presence in the world and does a lot of vital work, cooperating with other countries. Introducing something like a forced military service would alienate a lot of the general public and change many peoples view of the military service to that of a negative one.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should not adopt a different model of military service. The current model seems to be working fine and is not in need of any changes. The UK's military still has a strong presence in the world and does a lot of vital work, cooperating with other countries. Introducing something like a forced military service would alienate a lot of the general public and change many peoples view of the military service to that of a negative one.
