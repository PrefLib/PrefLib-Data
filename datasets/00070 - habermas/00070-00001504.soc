# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the use of AI in the judicial system is unethical. AI is not advanced enough to understand complex social situations and is not able to make decisions which affect individuals. The use of AI in the judicial system would be unethical as it would not have any moral values and would not be able to make just outcomes. AI is not advanced enough to understand complex social situations and is not able to make decisions which affect individuals. AI can only repeat information like a parrot, but cannot be relied to then use that repeated information to make a just outcome. However, the use of AI in the judicial system would be ethical if it was used as a tool to help the judicial system, but not to make final decisions. AI can be useful in the judicial system to help gain clarity and perspective throughout the process. However, the final decisions should be made by humans, with the help of data from AI.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the use of AI in the judicial system is not ethical. However, the use of AI in the judicial system could be ethical in certain situations, for example, when a human is not available to make a decision, or when a human is not capable of making a decision.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the use of AI in the judicial system could be useful in some instances. However, there are a number of issues with using AI in the judicial system that should be addressed before this is put into practice. For example, AI is not yet advanced enough to make a sound judgement call on a complicated social situation. AI could also be prone to bias depending on who is programming it. Also, AI does not have any moral values and therefore cannot make decisions which may affect individuals. However, it could be useful for specific tasks such as recording or transcribing in the judicial system. There is also an ethical issue with the use of AI in the judicial system. It could be used as a way to justify decisions which would normally be unethical to make. This could cause problems with a sense of accountability, as a human would be making the decision but AI would be blamed for the outcome. As a result of this, the group of participants would not recommend the use of AI in the judicial system at the moment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is ethical to use AI in the judicial system.
