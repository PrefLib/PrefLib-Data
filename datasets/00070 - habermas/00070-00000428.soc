# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The group is in favour of imposing a tariff on imported goods, however we do not think it should be so high as to put off foreign countries from trading with us and that the tariff we would expect to be paid on our goods would also be fair.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group came to the consensus view that we should not impose tariffs on imported goods.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, tariffs on imported goods are not a good idea. The government should not impose tariffs as they can cause problems between countries as well as cause increased prices for consumers. The government should encourage businesses to use locally sourced products. The government could use tax breaks to support this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a small tariff on imported goods. However this should not be so high that it becomes a barrier to trade. A small tariff on imported goods would help to encourage businesses to use locally sourced goods, however there should be an import tariff on goods we sell into other countries. Conclusion: Even though there were a variety of opinions from the participants, through discussions and debates the participants were able to come to a consensus view. This was a result of the participants listening to and respecting the views of others and of the facilitation by the panel leader who encouraged the participants to debate and ask questions of others in order to fully understand the others point of view. The discussions and debates of the participants led to a better understanding of the different views and opinions. This is how the Delphi method works. The facilitator encourages the participants to discuss and debate in order to reach a consensus view.
