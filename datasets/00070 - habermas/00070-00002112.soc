# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the House of Lords is an important part of the political system in the UK.  It is important to have a second opinion on laws and bills that are passed by the House of Commons.  However, the current system is undemocratic and we believe that it is important to make the majority of the work of the House of Lords elected.  This will allow for a more democratic system and will also allow the House of Lords to be more in touch with the views of the general public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the House of Lords should be elected. The current system is out of date and undemocratic. The public should have a say in who is in the House of Lords, however, there should be a balance between the views of the public and the views of the House of Lords. The public should not be able to elect anyone they want, but rather people who are deemed to be the most suitable for the role.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that most of the work of the House of Lords should be elected. This will give more people a voice, which in turn is more democratic and representative of the views of the general public. It is undemocratic for positions of this calibre to be appointed by previous PMs. However, the number of elected Lords should not outweigh the appointed Lords as some level of control needs to be retained by the Government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final Statement: I believe that it is fundamentally wrong for the majority of the House of Lords to be unelected. In the modern age, and with the progression of civil rights in the UK, it is a political anomaly for people to be able to obtain such a powerful position without the majority support of the general public. This is not to say that the elected members of the house of commons are any less powerful, but it does place the general public in a position where they do not feel as though they are heard. A democracy should by definition be run by the majority of the people and so the way that the house of lords currently operates is not democratic. A system should be put in place to democratise the process and allow members of the public to vote on those in power.
