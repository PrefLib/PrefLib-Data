# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the UK does not need to spend a great deal more on infrastructure. There are, however, some issues that are causing a great deal of concern for the people of the UK. Firstly, the cost of living is very high, and this is causing a great deal of problems for people. It is important that the government makes a conscious effort to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, there is a shortage of homes, especially in big cities. This is causing a great deal of problems for people, as they are unable to find affordable accommodation. The government needs to make a conscious effort to provide more homes for people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that infrastructure is something the UK can improve on, however we don't think a huge amount of money should be put into it as there are more important areas that require attention. For example, a significant amount of the NHS is understaffed and require more employees to make sure that people get the treatment they need and deserve. We feel that the main focus of infrastructure should be to improve the state of inner cities. They have a lot of potential, however most people wouldn't want to visit them or even live in them. This is an issue that can be easily fixed by giving them some attention and improving the appearance of the streets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK should spend more on infrastructure as it would improve the quality of life for many people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: the UK should not spend more on infrastructure, as most of it is already in good condition, and there are more pressing issues that the UK should focus on.
