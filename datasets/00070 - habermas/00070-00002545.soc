# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Everyone should be entitled to have enough money to survive. This money should give food, shelter and clothing, that are basic in nature, for there is no reason that they should be embellished with delicacies or fine garments.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes there needs to be a basic level of wage that makes it possible for people to live, eat and pay their bills. It should not be more financially beneficial for people to stay at home and claim benefits, rather than go to work and contribute to society. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I think so yes, as everyone should have basic rights in terms of being able to buy the basics. People who cant afford food or to feed their kids, especially in a cost of living crisis, should have consistent help to afford the basic neccessities. This can also be used for utilities as well, which should always be affordable and people should have the finances to cover this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I believe we should be in favour of universal basic income. I believe this because there a lots of people in the UK who want to work, but physically or mentally can't. If there was no universal basic income these people would not be able to live independently. There are also lots of people in the UK who DO work but also have to have their income 'topped up' with universal basic income. If there was no universal basic income these hardworking people would not be able to make ends meat. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - to be honest i'm not sure what it would really mean for society and whether it would actually be achievable.
