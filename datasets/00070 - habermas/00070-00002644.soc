# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - If you are smoking in your breaks then yes it is ok. This is because it is your time and as long as you are smoking somewhere respectful to others around you it is your choice. However, if extra smoke breaks are needed then it is unfair to give extra time to some employees and not others. As well as this, there should not be a smoking culture in a workplace in which workers feel pressured to smoke. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I do not think it is okay to smoke on the job at all. Perhaps when you are on break but otherwise no. You are not being paid to smoke, and it has terrible disadvantages to health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I do not believe it is okay to smoke on the job in the same way that I do not believe it is okay to drink on the job. It is a disgusting, antisocial habit, and too many work places allow additional breaks for smokers which are not extended to non-smokers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Smoking is an incredibly unhealthy habit and should not be encouraged at all in the workplace, or on the grounds at all. You are paid to work, not smoke. If it is in a break and off site, then ok, but I feel we should be striving towards removing this destructive habit from society altogether.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I don't think so. By smoking on the job, you are taking time away from work and thereby taking time away from the hours your employer pays you for. It is also unfair to colleagues who don't smoke on the job, who end up spending more time working (because comparatively you are regularly away from your work station throughout the day), and likely picking up your slack. I also think its unsociable as even if you smoke outside in a well-ventilated area, doing so regularly will mean you smell strongly of cigarette smoke in your workplace.
