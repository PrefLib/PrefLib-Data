# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of not having an age limit on who can run for Prime Minister. The group felt that the party would appoint the appropriate leader based on their experience, views and future for the part and country, this will be reflected by their overall age and experience. With experience comes age, so the group did not feel this should be an issue. The group also felt that the skills and aptitude of the candidate should speak to the party and country and allow them to make a judgement as to who is best for the role. The group felt that concerns relating to old age and whether someone is fit to do the role will be taken into account by people who are voting. The group felt that it should be left to the people to decide.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the age of a person should not be a barrier to them becoming Prime Minister. The role of Prime Minister is an important one and it is therefore important that the person who holds this position is experienced and knowledgeable. This means that there should be a minimum age for a person to be eligible to become Prime Minister. However, there should be no maximum age limit. This is because there are many examples of people who have been successful in their chosen field at a very young age. If a young person has the necessary skills and qualities, then there is no reason why they should not be able to become Prime Minister.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of not having an age limit for the role of Prime Minister. The group felt that the role of the Prime Minister was a very important one, and as such, a person of any age should be able to run for the role if they felt they were capable. The group felt that the role of the Prime Minister was not one that required a great deal of physical strength, and as such, it was not an issue if a person was old. The group did, however, feel that the role of the Prime Minister was one that required a great deal of experience, and as such, the role should only be open to people who were of a certain age. The group felt that a person of the age of 40 should be able to run for the role of Prime Minister, and as such, a person of any age above this should be able to run for the role.
