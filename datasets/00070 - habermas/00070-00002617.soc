# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The only thing I can consider about this topic is to upgrade the voting ballot system to electronical system like they are doing in the US. Other than that I believe current voting system is good to preserve democracy while I'm also not very experienced and have deep knowledge about those  topics so I'm really keen to read your responses for this question and many thanks for everyone for sharing their opinions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - i havent voted previously as i dont see a positive part of any one looking for votes but i do think it is flawed in its current state so i am neutral.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I don't know too much about politics so it's a little hard for me to give an opinion on this topic but as far as I can see there always seems to be one party in charge that can do pretty much what they want. I think we should have two or three parties in charge who then have to work together to try and come up with compromises and solutions that work for everyone to ensure we don't end up with decisions that are too radical. It would help to keep the overall balance in the centre.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I believe the voting system in the UK is fair.  I do feel, however, that giving the vote to 16 year olds is fool hardy as they are not equipped mentally or have enough knowledge or experience to make an informed vote. I feel people should be encourage more to vote and political parties should be made to explain their policies in a clear and concise way that everyone can understand. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - This is definitely tricky because I am unsure how it could be improved to make it fair, except maybe some kind of little test for everyone to show we understand what we are voting for and why. We are always lied to by politicians and more so for the lead up to the elections, and then people get swayed to vote based on one or two small bits of information and don't realise the repurcussions - take Brexit for example. I definitely say it needs to be kept at 18+, as 16 is too young to vote or to really know what you want or agree with.
