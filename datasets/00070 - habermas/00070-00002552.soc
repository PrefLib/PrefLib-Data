# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although originally fossil fuels were seen as one of the greatest natural resources available to man, we have come to realise that they are both finite and harmful to the environment.  The environment would benefit hugely if we all reduced our reliance on fossil fuels and modern technology is allowing us to do so, allowing us to move forward into a brighter future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes we would be much better off as use of fossil fuels causes air pollution which contributes to climate change. Also, fossil fuels can only last so long so once they are gone, they will be good for good.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: our dependence on fossil fuels has already caused serious environmental and climate damage, it poses a health hazard by creating pollution and has  provoked serious social and geopolitical consequences
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It would be better for society if we reduced our use of fossil fuels. The negative effects of the use of fossil fuels have been well documented, whether this is their impact upon climate change, or the potential for negatively effecting peoples health. There is also the consideration that fossil fuels are a finite product and continuing to use them at the current rate, may deplete them before adequate alternatives have been generated and implemented across society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Yes, the excessive use of fossil fuels is without doubt causing climate change and damaging the eco system. Switching to clean energy alternatives will eventually lead to cheaper energy, less pollution and more energy security for countries around the world.
