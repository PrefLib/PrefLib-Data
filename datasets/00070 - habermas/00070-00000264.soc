# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, people who do not have UK citizenship should not be allowed to vote in UK elections. But, this is a complicated issue. For example, if a person is only living in the UK for a short period of time they would not know as much about the country and its issues as a person who was born and raised here. On the other hand, a person who is born and raised in the UK would not be as affected by a policy change as a person who will live here for a long period of time. A person who is living in the UK but will only be living here for a short period of time should not be able to vote, but people who live here for longer periods of time and have been here since their birth should have the right to vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The law should remain unchanged. However, those who have lived in the UK for a long time should be given the right to vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People who do not have UK citizenship should be allowed to vote in UK elections. The issue of citizenship is a highly politicised one and could lead to a substantial amount of controversy in UK society. The suggestion that people who are not citizens of the UK should be allowed to vote in UK elections would be seen by some as an erosion of British values and national identity. However, it is important to understand that Britain is made up of many cultures and ethnicities and as such, people from all over the world have contributed to its rich and diverse culture and have made Britain what it is today. Therefore, people from other countries should be allowed to vote in UK elections, given that they will also be affected by the outcome of elections.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People living in the UK should be able to vote after a certain amount of time living in the UK, and if they can demonstrate that they are well-informed about the issues, so that they can make a well-informed vote. - Group 2
