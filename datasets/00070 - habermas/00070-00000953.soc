# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the voting age should not be raised to 21. This is because, at 18, young people are old enough to make important decisions about their future, and are old enough to understand the voting process. Therefore, they should be allowed to have a say in how the country is run, as the decisions of politicians and law makers will directly affect them, for example: decisions about taxes, employment and such. If you raise the voting age to 21 then you miss out on a large demographic having a say on matters that mean the most to them. You risk disenfranchising them and alienating young people this way. Politics could also sway in a direction which doesn't support young people at all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, the voting age should not be raised to 21. This is because, young people are more likely to be affected by the decisions of the politicians and law makers. Therefore, they should be allowed to have a say in how the country is run. The current voting age is 18 and at this age a person can leave school and compulsory education and can start working. Therefore, they should be allowed to have a say in how the country is run, as the decisions of politicians and law makers will directly affect them, for example: decisions about taxes, employment and such. If you raise the voting age to 21 then you miss out on a large demographic having a say on matters that mean the most to them. You risk disenfranchising them and alienating young people this way.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, the voting age should not be raised to 21. The voting age should remain at 18 as this is the age that a person can start working, paying taxes and contributing to society. The voting age should not be raised as it would mean that a large range of people would be excluded from having a say in the way the country is run. The current voting age is 18 and at this age a person can leave school and compulsory education and can start working.
