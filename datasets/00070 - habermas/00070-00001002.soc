# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the current drug laws are ineffective and should be replaced by a system of regulation and taxation. This would allow for better education on the risks of drug use, as well as reducing the power of criminal organisations. The current laws are also unfair, as they disproportionately affect ethnic minorities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of decriminalising drugs, but in the context of this question, it was felt that drugs that are illegal should remain so. There was a lot of debate around whether drugs that are not a health risk should be legalised, and in general the group felt that it would be difficult to determine what drugs were not a health risk. There was also a feeling that there is a difference between prosecuting someone who is using drugs for personal use, and someone who is dealing drugs. In the former case, it was felt that prosecution should not be pursued.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of prosecuting people who use drugs that are not considered a health risk, but are not legal. The group thought that the law should be upheld, and that drugs should not be legalised. However, the group also thought that there was a distinction between prosecution and punishment. The group thought that people who are caught using drugs should be prosecuted, but that the punishment should be a small fine rather than prison time. The group also thought that the law should be changed to allow the use of medicinal cannabis, and that the current law on the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes should be relaxed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of decriminalising drugs that are not considered a health risk. The group felt that prosecuting people for using drugs that are not considered a health risk is a waste of resources, and that the law is outdated. The group felt that there should be more research into the effects of drugs, and that the law should be changed to reflect the latest findings. The group felt that the law should reflect the risks to health posed by drugs, and that it should be up to the individual to decide whether they want to take the risk.
