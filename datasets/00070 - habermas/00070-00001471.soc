# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of abolishing private schools.  It was felt that the current system is unfair and that the quality of education is not necessarily better in private schools.  However, it was also felt that private schools do provide a valuable service for those who can afford them.  Therefore, it was felt that the current system should be maintained but that private schools should be taxed to provide funding for public schools.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that the private education system should not be abolished, we understand that the current system is unfair, however, we do not believe that the abolition of private education is the way to solve this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, private schools should not be abolished. They are an important part of history and have developed some great individuals throughout the years. They are often quality and are therefore money well spent, provided you can afford them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: While the privatisation of schools does give unfair advantages to the wealthy, it is an essential part of society. There are some high quality private schools which produce some great students, as well as many average schools. It also ensures that the economy is stimulated through increased spending on education, allowing people to spend their money where they wish.
