# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - A company's board of directors should have the same demographic make up as the company's average workforce. This is because the board of directors is the most senior leadership team in the company and as such, they should be representative of the workforce as a whole. This will ensure that all employees are represented and that their needs and concerns are addressed. This will also ensure that the board of directors have a good understanding of the issues and concerns of the workforce and will be able to make informed decisions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “No, however it is beneficial to the business if a board has the same demographic make up as the average workforce and should be considered during the process of hiring board members.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, a company's board of directors should not have the same demographic make up as the company's average workforce. This is because the board of directors would be comprised of experienced middle-aged people and the company's average workforce may be formed by people who are younger than them. Moreover, the company's average workforce may be comprised of people who are not highly educated and have no experience in the business world. The group believes that the board of directors should be comprised of people who have experience and expertise in the business world and who can make the best decisions for the company.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Diversity within a company is always beneficial, whether in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation or religious beliefs. If the demographics of a company's board of directors do not reflect the demographics of the company's average workforce, there is a greater risk that problems within the company may not be noticed, and that initiatives that could help the company may be overlooked. On the other hand, it is important to recognise that it is not necessary for the board of directors to be made up of people who look like the average workers, but rather of people who can bring their own unique and diverse perspectives to the table, and who have the expertise and knowledge necessary to do their job well.
