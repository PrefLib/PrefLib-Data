# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the UK should not build a moon base. The UK is facing the biggest cost of living crisis in a generation. We do not need to waste money on frivolous ventures that have little positive impact to the greater population. There are much more important things that need investment such as housing, the NHS, and transport infrastructure.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, the UK should not build a moon base. There are more important issues that need to be addressed in the UK. The UK should not waste money on this when there are more important issues that need to be addressed. The UK should instead use its resources to help those in need in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the UK should not build a base on the moon. This would use resources which would be better utilised on environmental issues which would negate the need for a base on the moon. If the Government were to pay for this to be done, it would be a waste of taxpayers money as it would not be able to be used by all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the UK should not build a base on the moon.  This would use resources which would be better utilised on environmental issues which would negate the need for a base on the moon.  If the Government were to pay for this to be done, it would be a waste of taxpayers money as it would not be able to be used by all.  The UK does not need to build its own moon base. Money should instead be devoted to more urgent services, such as health care (the NHS) and welfare. In the future, the UK will be able to use the moon bases of its allies, such as those of the United States.
