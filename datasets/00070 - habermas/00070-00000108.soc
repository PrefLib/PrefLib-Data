# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Humans have an innate ability to be moral. Religion may have helped develop this sense of morality but it is not necessary to be moral.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Humans have the innate ability to be moral. We can distinguish between right and wrong and we don’t need to be told.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that humans have an innate sense of morality. Even though morality has been developed over time, the seeds of morality were sown into humans from the start. We came to the conclusion that people are born with an innate sense of morality because this would help a community to survive and prosper.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “I believe that we are all born with an innate sense of morality, because as soon as a child is born they can distinguish right from wrong. This innate sense is developed throughout life by watching those around them, especially their parents. They also learn from society in general, by listening to the news, watching tv and learning from their peers at school. I believe that some people are more morally aware than others, which makes them more likely to engage in good deeds and help those in need.”
