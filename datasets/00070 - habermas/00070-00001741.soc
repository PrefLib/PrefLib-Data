# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, for-profit corporations should not be allowed to run state schools. This is because we believe that the focus of schools should be on providing the best education possible for students, and not on making a profit. This could lead to a postcode lottery on school places and there may be a huge difference in teaching throughout the country. We also believe that the education sector should be funded by the government, and that this is the best way to ensure that all students, regardless of their background, receive a good education. We also feel that this is the best way to ensure that all children, regardless of their background, are given the same opportunities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, for-profit corporations should not be allowed to run state schools, in order to prevent a worsened postcode lottery on school places. However, this would require an increase in funding of state schools by the government, because a for-profit education sector would lead to more money being invested in students' education.

This is because we believe that the focus of schools should be on providing the best education possible for students, and not on making a profit. This could lead to a postcode lottery on school places and there may be a huge difference in teaching throughout the country. This would also lead to a sort of US style education system, whereby families have to move to wealthy areas to access better state schools. We also believe that the education sector should be funded by the government, and that this is the best way to ensure that all students, regardless of their background, receive a good education. We also believe that the education sector should be run in a more efficient manner and this could improve the quality of the education system if funded properly by the government.
