# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, I think poorer people should have access to a certain number of meals per week/month and that this should be subsidized by the state. This should be means-tested, i.e. depending on circumstances. No one should have to go hungry. Funding for this should be pooled from additional taxes on extreme wealth and corporations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No I do not think free meals should be given to people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The reason I think this way is because disadvantaged backgrounds is a very broad spectrum and people come from those backgrounds for all kinds of reasons. People need encouragement to fend for themselves in this life. It’s all to easy to do nothing whilst the basics in life are provided for you.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I think that all people should have access to food and it should be considered a basic human right. Those who are disadvantaged and don't have access to food should be entitled to a basic amount of food. In schools all children should be entitled to free school meals from disadvantaged low income backgrounds. To aid in this there should be some form of means testing to see if people are entitled to free food by checking thier income and household cost to ensuer that people are not taking advantage of the system for their own gain when they don't need free food.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think this is a very complex issue.  It comes down to the definition of a disadvantaged background.  In order to ensure that no children is without food, i would whole-heartedly agree that we should ensure that there is food provision for them, and would have to look at the families economic background the the opportunities are for the family. it depeneds on working history and also employment benefits,  it is a very complex matter
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - In schools? Absolutely, it may be the only time some children are able to eat nutritious meals. I'm not sure in other senses how the best way to do this? Until recently food was very cheap in this country and food banks and homelessness was quiet rare, so it's tough to know what kind of funding and infrastructure we would need.
