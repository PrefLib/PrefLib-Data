# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be an incentive system for recycling correctly. For example, vouchers for certain food/drink outlets and tax rebates. This is an easy way to make people recycle, so there is less waste produced. It would be expensive for the government, however, in the long run it would be beneficial for the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It was thought that the government should pay people to recycle, however, there should be more of an incentive for the recycling to be recycled correctly rather than be thrown away in the bin, such as vouchers for buying food or drinks which have recyclable products, or even a discount on council tax. This will help people recycle more correctly and in turn will increase the amount of people that recycle as they can see the benefit from it, which in turn will decrease the amount of waste that is created. Overall, it was thought that if people are being paid by the government to recycle correctly, it will increase the amount of people recycling, which in turn will decrease the amount of waste produced. However, this will take a long time to come into effect, as people are so set in their ways and aren't likely to change what they do easily. This is why it was thought that an incentive such as the above should be used to encourage more people to recycle.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Paying the public to recycle correctly will have good effects and negative effects. This will only be the case if it is done correctly as it will take a long time to implement, so if it is done wrong it could cause negative effects for it. It could also cost a large amount of money, for example if everyone in the country recycles correctly, it could cost a large amount of money for the government to buy the recyclable materials, this is why it was thought that if you recycled correctly you were given a voucher which was said above in the draft consensus statement, this voucher could help to get you some money off your shopping, or bills such as council tax. This would help to increase the rate of people recycling and would help to lower the amount of waste produced. This is what the team of participants agreed on, after giving the consensus statement some time to be thought about, they realized that there could be many cons to it. There is also a high chance that it would work well as it will give people an incentive to recycle, rather than not caring about what they recycle or if it is even being recycled correctly.
