# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I don't think its right that all people in the UK need to wear a face covering. I believe it has been shown in data studies that wearing face coverings or not has not had the effect of reducing the spread of CovID .  I believe it should be down to the individual concerned as to whether they want to wear one if it makes them feel more comfortably covered in their own minds.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: At the moment in the UK there is no need to make people wear a face mask. Covid is now under control and the use of face masks should be totally optional. Should there be another outbreak of a disease then I wouldn't be opposed to making people wear them if the science backed up their use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, I think it is invasive and not needed.  We are no longer in a pandemic therefore it is no longer required.  Everyone got vaccinated for a reason.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: This feels like an outdated question. Of course during the prominent period of Covid, this was required by the government in an attempt to reduce the virus. However we are in a different place now and the threat has reduced significantly. And to be honest whilst I am not dismissing that Covid is a real thing, it does appear that everything has been bundled into one (colds, flu etc along with Covid) that there is no clear distinguishment. I do not believe there is any reason to require the population of the UK to wear a face mask. There are also a lot of concerns that came alongside wearing the mask itself along with other measures. I think like with anything, an extreme black and white solution is not the way. You have to look at the individual, everyone is different with different requirements, and not one way of doing thing is correct for all. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: No. During COVID there were a lot of unknowns about how the virus behaves and it's severity. I think most people now would say that COVID is not particularly dangerous to the majority of the population but is a definite inconvenience. People should be able to wear masks if they would like, in particular if they feel they have a cold, but i don't feel this should be mandatory. Wearing a mask all day is particularly challenging for people who work in customer facing roles for long shifts and other groups of people such as hard of hearing or deaf people who rely on lip reading.
