# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that our planet is overpopulated, we have reached our optimum population capacity. There is a wide range of reasons for this, including the increase in lifespan, the decrease in deaths, the increase in birth rate, immigration, etc. All of this results in an overpopulation problem, and it is only getting worse. This will cause huge problems for the planet, including increased poverty, a decrease in non-renewable resources, pollution, and so on. The current situation cannot continue. The overpopulation problem must be dealt with. It is difficult to do so, because there are a lot of people, and it is difficult to control the birth rate, as well as immigration. It is a very difficult problem to deal with, and it is not one that can be dealt with easily, or in the short term.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, the world is becoming overpopulated. This is causing issues for poverty, global warming and housing especially, and puts a strain on non-renewable resources. The fact that the NHS is so over worked is just one evidence that we are over-populated. The amount of traffic and pollution is further evidence that we are not coping with the current population size. The world has a finite amount of resources and that infinite growth is not possible. This means that with the ever-increasing population we are putting a huge strain on ecosystems and we are putting humanity in a difficult position in which a solid quality of life for all humans will simply not be possible. With over population, it will be difficult to find a balance where everyone can have access to the things they need to survive. Also, there might be a concern about energy usage as well and habitats being destroyed for the growing population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The world is overpopulated and this is causing issues for poverty, global warming and housing especially, and puts a strain on non-renewable resources. This is a very difficult issue to tackle, however, because it is due to positive things such as better healthcare and longer life-spans.
