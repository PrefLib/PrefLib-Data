# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The house of lords is a good idea in theory. It provides checks and balances on the government and ensures that legislation is not rushed through parliament. However, the current make-up of the house of lords is undemocratic. It should be elected by the people and not appointed by the government. The current system is open to abuse by the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the idea of having a second chamber is a good idea. It is important to have a system of checks and balances in place to ensure that the government is held accountable for its actions. However, it is important that this second chamber is elected by the people, and is not made up of unelected members. This is because the unelected members will have their own personal interests at heart, rather than the interests of the people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The House of Lords should be reformed so that it consists of a democratically elected second chamber, and the powers of this chamber should be reformed so that they cannot block, but only delay, legislation. The group were able to discuss the pros and cons of each person's view, and come to a decision that everyone in the group could agree on.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The House of Lords has a number of advantages in the UK. It gives an opportunity for people who are not politicians to enter the political world. It provides a counter-balance to the House of Commons and acts as a way of checking the powers of the Government. However, the way the House of Lords currently works needs to be overhauled. The members should be elected by the public, rather than being appointed by the Government of the day, in order to reflect the will of the people. It is not necessarily the structure of the House of Lords which is the problem but rather how it is currently used and how it is composed. It needs to be improved to reflect the values of the people it represents and is intended to represent.
