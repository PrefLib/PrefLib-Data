# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The smoking ban in pubs, bars, and restaurants is a good thing. It has contributed to a significant reduction in smoking prevalence and represents one of the biggest public health initiatives in recent times. It will have encouraged thousands of smokers to quit and saved bar and restaurant workers from the dangers of passive smoke. It has made smokers feel increasingly isolated and confined to the cold outside. While non-smokers no longer need to wash their clothes after visiting a bar or restaurant.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the smoking ban is a good thing. It protects people from the dangers of passive smoking and makes bars and restaurants a much more pleasant place to be. The ban is also an important step in encouraging people to give up smoking. There are however some important issues that need to be considered. The ban is very recent and there is some evidence to suggest that it may be leading to an increase in alcohol consumption. This is because smokers who may have previously had a cigarette with their drink are now drinking more as they are unable to smoke in the bar or restaurant. Also, the ban has been implemented at a time when there is a recession and people are less likely to go out and spend money. This means that bars and restaurants are suffering and some have had to close. The ban has also led to some pubs and bars turning into nightclubs and this is leading to a rise in binge drinking and alcohol related crime in the early hours of the morning.
