# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “In general, the group was in favour of immigration, however there was a need for some sort of control on the numbers of immigrants coming into the country.

There should be checks in place, to prevent uncontrolled immigration. Such controls should be focused on ensuring only those who could bring skill-sets which would benefit the economy are allowed into the country. Such skill-sets should be ones that the economy is lacking in. It was also felt that people should be able to work in areas that the local population would be unwilling to do.
