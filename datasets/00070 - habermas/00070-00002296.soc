# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should not encourage people to go into higher education. Whilst it can be a great opportunity to learn new skills and can be key in landing certain jobs it also comes with downsides like the large amounts of debt you rack up. For many people alternatives like apprenticeships where they can learn practical skills on the job and start earning straight out of college are the better option. It should be the governments job to present the full spectrum of post GCSE and A-level options so that individuals can choose the option which fits them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should encourage people to go into higher education, but not solely. The government should also promote vocational training and apprenticeships as these can be just as beneficial to the individual and the country as a whole. The government should also ensure that there is an adequate support network in place for people that do go into higher education. This can include financial support, but also support networks for mental health and wellbeing. The government should also ensure that there is a wide variety of higher education courses available, so that people can find the course that is right for them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the government should not encourage people to go into higher education. Many young people go into higher education because they believe that they have to, and many do not enjoy the experience. There are many opportunities for young people in the world of work, and many careers do not require a degree. The government should also encourage young people to consider apprenticeships and vocational training, which can be just as valuable as higher education. The government should not encourage young people to go into higher education, but should present the full spectrum of options available to them, so that they can make an informed choice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should not solely encourage people to go into higher education. Whilst higher education can be a great opportunity to learn new skills and can be key in landing certain jobs it also comes with downsides like the large amounts of debt you rack up. For many people alternatives like apprenticeships where they can learn practical skills on the job and start earning straight out of college are the better option.
