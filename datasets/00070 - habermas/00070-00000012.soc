# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should continue to license the radio frequency spectrum. Licensing the radio frequency spectrum ensures that the radio frequency spectrum is not monopolised by large businesses and it ensures that there is a variety of programmes on the radio which allows for different groups to have their views expressed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should continue to license the radio frequency spectrum as this ensures that there is a fair system for people to access the radio frequency spectrum and it prevents an unfair situation where a few businesses take control of the radio frequency spectrum. It also ensures that there are a variety of programmes on the radio which will allow for different groups to have their views expressed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should continue to license the radio frequency spectrum. The licence fee ensures that the public are provided with a wide variety of programmes. The licence fee also helps to ensure that large businesses do not control all of the radio frequency spectrum and that small businesses and the public have a fair chance to use the radio frequency spectrum.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should continue to license the radio frequency spectrum. Licensing ensures that there is a fair system for people to access the radio frequency spectrum and it prevents an unfair situation where a few businesses take control of the radio frequency spectrum. It also ensures that there are a variety of programmes on the radio which will allow for different groups to have their views expressed. However, a review should be undertaken of how the licensing is currently managed and whether it meets the needs of the general public.
