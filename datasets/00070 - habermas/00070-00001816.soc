# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should be allowed to buy land and give it to the poor. This is because the poor could grow their own crops and be able to be independent in the future. They would not have to rely on the government as much for aid which would save the government money. However, the government would have to be very careful in selecting the land to buy and the people to give it to. They would have to make sure that it would not impact anyone negatively and there would be no repercussions. The poor could use the land to grow their own crops and use it to benefit the economy and provide more food for others. Specific land would be able to be used so that it is not harmful to anyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should be allowed to buy land and give it to the poor so long as it is a situation where the people receiving it will use the land productively and not negatively impact anyone else (through more homelessness, destroying nature, or anything else). Further, the participants that work productively should be encouraged by the government to do more of what they are doing and rewarded more for doing so. Conclusions: After reaching a consensus, the participants had a discussion about how the software worked, what its limitations were, and whether there were any features missing. Below is some of what was expressed by the group. Conclusion 1: It definitely works great, this could be used easily in schools and it could also be used if you wanted to do something very specific, for example, you have to agree on an exact piece of land etc. Conclusion 2: It was quite good to use this tool and see how it works, it was quite easy. It would've been good to have it not just on paper but maybe a virtual world where everyone can see what's going on with the other Conclusion 3: I feel this tool is very useful if you need to sort through different opinions in an informal environment such as friends. But it
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should be allowed to buy land and give it to the poor. This is because the poor could grow their own crops and be able to be independent in the future. They would not have to rely on the government as much for aid which would save the government money. However, the government would have to be very careful in selecting the land to buy and the people to give it to. They would have to make sure that it would not impact anyone negatively and there would be no repercussions. The poor would need to show that they are working hard and trying to be independent so that they are not just relying on the government to give them land. This would also show that the land is not being wasted and is being used productively.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should be allowed to buy land and give it to the poor, if the poor agree to grow crops to provide the people with food. Feedback is welcomed!
