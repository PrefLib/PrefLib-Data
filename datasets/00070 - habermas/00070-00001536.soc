# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should not collect personal data regarding its citizens as this will allow the government to use this data to their own advantage. This can be seen in the past where governments have used data to lie to the people and use the data to their own advantage. This is not in the interest of the people and will not help in the development of a country. The government should only collect data on the citizens if it is completely anonymous and will not allow the government to gain any personal information about the people. If the data collected is anonymous, it will not allow the government to build fake statistics based on 'real' information which doesn't exist. This will help the government to remain truthful to the people and to help build a stronger relationship between the government and the people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the collection of personal data by the government is not wrong, but it is important that the data is used in a responsible way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is not wrong for the government to collect personal data about its citizens. However, we would like to see the following principles:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group was in agreement that it is wrong for the government to collect personal data about its citizens without prior knowledge. There are some forms of personal data that are important for the government to have, but they should be collected and stored in an anonymous way. The data should be collected, stored and destroyed after a reasonable period of time unless it is needed to help guide the government in some way. If the government decides to use the data to help guide decisions, then they should make this clear to the citizens, explaining exactly how the data will be used and why.
