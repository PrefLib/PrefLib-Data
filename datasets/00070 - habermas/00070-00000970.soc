# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the government should not spend less money on education and more on prisons.  The government needs to invest in education, and ensure that every child in the country receives the best education possible.  This will ensure that the country has a strong future workforce, and that people have the skills needed to get a good job.  It will also mean that people are less likely to find themselves in a situation where they commit a crime and end up in prison.  Whilst prisons need to be maintained and the staff need to be paid, this should not be done at the expense of the education system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, the government should not spend less money on education and more on prisons.  Education is a fundamental right for everybody and should be treated as such.  Prisons should not be treated as a holiday camp, but people who commit crimes should not be treated inhumanely either.  People in prison should be given the opportunity to work and contribute to society, and the money they earn should be spent on improving their own facilities.  This is a win-win situation for everybody.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of more money being spent on education.  Education is important for all members of society and can help to reduce the number of people who end up in prison.  However, the group also acknowledged that there are certain situations where the prison system is in need of reform and that in these situations, it is necessary to spend more money on prisons.  The group felt that the money spent on prisons should be used to ensure that the prison system is humane and rehabilitating, and that it should not be used to create a luxurious environment for prisoners.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, the government should not spend less money on education and more on prisons.  Education is a fundamental right for all and is something that all people need.  Spending less money on education would lead to a poorer quality of education for all, which would have negative consequences for the future of the country.  People in prison have been put there for a reason, and so their basic needs should be provided for, but prisons should not be places of comfort.  Education is the key to a brighter future for all.
