# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We do not think the voting age should be reduced to 12. 12 year olds do not have an informed opinion about politics. This means that they will not know who to vote for or why they are voting for them. We believe that 12 year olds are not ready to vote for their political leaders.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should not reduce the voting age to 12. 12 year olds do not have a well-informed opinion about politics and therefore would not know who to vote for or why they are voting for them. We believe that 12 year olds are not ready to vote for their political leaders and should be allowed to be children and enjoy their youth.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 12 year olds should not be allowed to vote. Children of this age are too young to vote for their political leaders. A 12 year old child is not well-informed about political issues and is not ready to make any political decisions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children should not be allowed to vote at 12 as they do not have a well-informed opinion on the important political issues of the day. 12 year olds are too young to decide on these matters and it would be better for them to be left to enjoy their youth and not worry about politics. We should not reduce the voting age to 12 as they do not have the right level of understanding to be able to make such a decision.
