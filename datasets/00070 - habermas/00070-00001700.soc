# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should use public funds to develop AI, this is because it will give a voice to the public, people will be able to decide how and when AI should be used.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of using public funds to develop AI.  This is because it is likely to lead to many economic and social advantages.  The group was also of the opinion that public funds should be used to support this as it is currently being developed by a monopoly of tech giants.  If public funding were to be given, it is likely to have a positive impact on the morality and ethics applied to AI development, something which is really lacking in the AI world at present.  Afterall, an algorithm is bias written in code and therefore it can only be fair and inclusive if more people are included in that coding phase.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that public funds should be used to develop artificial intelligence (AI) as it is likely to have a positive impact on the morality and ethics applied to AI development, something which is really lacking in the AI world at present.  This is because an algorithm is bias written in code and therefore it can only be fair and inclusive if more people are included in that coding phase.  We also feel it is important for countries such as the UK to keep up with progress of AI as not doing so will put us at a disadvantage compared to other countries that are making investments in this.  However, it is important to ensure that people from all backgrounds have the opportunity to be involved in the development of AI as we feel that diversity is a key factor in making sure that the final product is unbiased.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should use public funds to develop AI as it is going to be a big part of the future and will be very important. If we do not use public funds to develop AI then we will fall behind other countries and not be able to compete.
