# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The United Kingdom should be a member of the European Union. Since leaving the Union, Britain's economy, world standing and international reputation have plummeted. We have seen that the reasons given for Brexit - to take back control, to reduce immigration, to cut back red tape etc - have amounted to nothing - we are several years post Brexit and still have massive unchecked migration, our economy is in tatters as more paperwork has been put into place, not less, and any control we did have is marginal. Whilst a member of the EU, we had the ability to change the system from the outside. From the outside we don't have that ability - we are stuck, isolated on our lonely little island. The threats to the Good Friday peace agreement from trade on the Northern Ireland border and the issues with trade agreements non-withstanding (Yes we can buy tariff free beef from Japan, but that doesn't make up for the lowest economic forecast in the G20 - one that is worse than Russia's)
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the United Kingdom would be better off as a member of the European Union.  The United Kingdom is a trading nation and the EU is the largest single market in the world.  Leaving the EU has caused many problems for the UK, including a lower economic forecast, a lower world standing, and the threat of a hard border in Northern Ireland.  However, the United Kingdom is a democracy and people are entitled to vote as they see fit.  The United Kingdom is not a member of the European Union and will not be in the near future.
