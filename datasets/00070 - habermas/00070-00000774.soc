# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of giving all adults a monthly allowance. However, they recognised that it was not currently feasible and that there were many issues with it. The group discussed how this would be very expensive and that this would need to be funded by taxes, which would be unpopular. They also discussed that the rich would be able to save this money and get richer, while the poor would need to spend it on necessities. The group also discussed that people would not be motivated to work and that this would affect the economy. However, the group thought that in an ideal world this would be a good idea and that it should be something that we should aim for in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of a monthly allowance being given to all adults, although with some caveats. The amount of the allowance should be fixed and not depend on income. It should be enough to cover basic living costs, but not so much that it would cause people to stop working. It should be made clear that this allowance is not a replacement for welfare benefits, and that those who are already receiving welfare benefits will continue to do so. The allowance should be given to all adults, including those in full-time education, and the elderly. The group felt that there would be some issues with this system, for example with the allowance being taken advantage of by family members or carers, but that the benefits outweighed the costs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of giving all adults a monthly allowance, but with some restrictions. For example, we would like to see the allowance given to adults who are currently unemployed and/or in financial hardship. We also discussed the idea of having the allowance given to those who are in the care system and who are currently not employed, but we felt that this may not be the best idea as it could lead to some people becoming dependent on the allowance. We also felt that if the allowance is given to all adults, it would be very difficult to monitor how the allowance is being spent. Therefore, we would like to see the allowance given to people who are currently unemployed and in financial hardship.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of giving all adults a monthly allowance by the government. However, there were a number of concerns raised. For example, some people may be taken advantage of by family members and others. The group was also concerned about how the allowance would be funded. Some people thought that it would be funded by increasing taxes, which could be unfair. The group also thought that it would be important to have some kind of regulation to ensure that the allowance was used appropriately.
