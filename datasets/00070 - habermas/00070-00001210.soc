# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The concept of a basic income scheme is an excellent one. There are so many who live in extreme poverty. A basic income scheme would be an invaluable resource in helping those individuals to access basic necessities such as food and shelter. It would provide a stable foundation for those with the desire to improve their circumstances, by increasing the prospect of obtaining employment in the future. However, it is also important to consider the concept of a basic income scheme from a business point of view. If all employees were entitled to a basic income scheme, and all of those employees worked for the same employer, the costs for that employer would be huge. It would affect businesses large and small, and if the impact was to be huge, this could have a devastating effect on businesses. It would affect job security, and result in many people losing their jobs as employers were no longer able to afford their employees, having to lay off workers in order to survive. However, with careful consideration of the issues around a basic income scheme, a solution could be found to make it a viable option, for the benefit of many people.
