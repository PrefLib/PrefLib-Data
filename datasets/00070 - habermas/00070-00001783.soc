# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a balance between the number of people coming into the country and the number of people leaving the country. There should be an upper limit on the number of people coming into the country. The government should take into account the needs of the country and the impact that the people coming into the country will have on the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We think we should allow people from other countries to come and work in the UK. We think that the work done by immigrants from other countries enriches our culture, and provides the UK with a wealth of experiences and knowledge. We also feel that immigrants make important contributions to the economy, providing the expertise and innovation to enhance the competitiveness of the UK. There are concerns that immigrants might take jobs from local people, or put downward pressure on wages, or strain public services. However, we believe that we should still allow people to come and work here, as long as we carefully consider all the above factors and have a well-regulated and fair immigration system that balances the benefits of immigration with the needs and interests of the country and its citizens. We also think that the government should put effort into training and retaining people so we don't have to rely on immigrants for these services. We think that the government should also ensure that unemployment isn't a problem in the country, so that people don't feel they have to go and find jobs elsewhere.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the UK should allow people from other countries to come and work in the UK. The country has a shortage of labour in many areas and needs to be able to draw on expertise from around the world. The UK has a long history of welcoming immigrants and this has contributed to the cultural diversity of the country. However, concerns about potential job competition, wage pressures, and strain on public services should be carefully considered. Policymakers must strive for a well-regulated and fair immigration system that balances the benefits of immigration with the needs and interests of the country and its citizens. Data-driven policies, public consultation, and humane considerations are vital for making informed decisions on this matter.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK needs to allow people from other countries to come and work in the UK because of the shortage of skilled workers, however, we need to ensure that jobs for UK citizens are not taken by the immigrants.
