# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should not be any limits on how much you can earn. If you work hard you should be able to get paid what you deserve for the work that you put in. It is also important to note that if a person is earning a lot of money, that they also pay their fair share of tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, there should not be a limit on how much you can earn. If you work hard, you should be allowed to earn as much as you want as the fruits of your labour. However, there should also be fair taxation to all tiers of income. Billionaires have access to certain financial products regular people don't which means they don't pay their fair share. As long as this is equal, they can earn as much as they want. Also, if people were capped on earning potential it would stifle creativity and hard work once someone reaches their earning ceiling. This would not be great for society.

It is also important to note that if a person is very successful, it also means that they are creating more jobs for people who work under them, so capping the income of a person like that is really taking away their incentive to create new jobs.
