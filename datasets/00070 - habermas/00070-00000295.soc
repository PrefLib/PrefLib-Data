# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, fracking for gas raises concerns about environmental impacts and public health risks. Although it can be seen as an efficient and cost-effective process of extracting oil, which is a "cleaner" alternative to coal, the drawbacks and impact on the environment and the public outweigh any positives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Fracking for gas is a dirty process, but it is a necessary one. The current threat of climate change on all of humanity should be our main focus. However, it is unlikely that we will be able to tackle this issue without developing and investing in more sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, fracking for gas raises concerns about environmental impacts and public health risks. Instead we should be looking for better alternatives for fuel.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although fracking can be seen as an efficient and cost-effective process of extracting oil, which is a "cleaner" alternative to coal, there are concerning drawbacks which persuades us to go against the idea. Due to the current monumental threat of climate change on all of humanity, the focus of all power industries should shift to developing and investing in more sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions.
