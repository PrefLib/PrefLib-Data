# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While the science of cannabis is still relatively new, and requires further study, there is a strong case for the use of cannabis to be legalised on both medical and recreational grounds. Cannabis use should be legalised but only for medical use, until the drug is proven safe, however it should be widely available to those who wish to use it in a recreational manner. Those using the drug recreationally should not be subjected to heavy fines, but should have their driving licenses revoked if they are found to be under the influence of cannabis whilst operating a vehicle. We believe that cannabis is not addictive, and so should not be classed as a harmful drug. If cannabis is proven to be addictive, it should be treated as a harmful drug and should be regulated by the state, in the same way that cigarettes and alcohol are currently.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Cannabis for medicinal use is important. The legal status of cannabis use is very important also. Driving under the influence of cannabis should be treated like drink-driving.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Final consensus statement: While the science of cannabis is still relatively new, and requires further study, there is a strong case for the use of cannabis to be legalised on both medical and recreational grounds. It is important that the medicinal benefits of the drug are encouraged, and that users have the right to engage in recreational activities on their own terms, so long as this doesn't interfere with the safety of others. Those driving a vehicle while under the influence of the drug should have their driving license revoked. Cannabis should be legally classified as a light drug and so only light punishments should be applied to users and sellers alike. We believe that if cannabis is proven to be addictive, it should be treated as a harmful drug and should be regulated by the state, in the same way that cigarettes and alcohol are currently.
