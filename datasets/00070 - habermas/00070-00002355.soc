# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the decision that disadvantaged groups should be given priority when it comes to university admissions. The reason for this is because we feel that people who are in a disadvantaged group are not given the same opportunities as those who are not. For example, people who are in a disadvantaged group may not have had the same education as those who are not and therefore will not have the same grades. We also feel that people who are in a disadvantaged group are not given the same opportunities when it comes to finding a job and so may not have the same experience as those who are not. We feel that this is unfair and so feel that disadvantaged groups should be given priority when it comes to university admissions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of giving disadvantaged groups admission priority to universities. However, it was also agreed that this should not be at the expense of those who have achieved the required grades for university, and that the disadvantaged groups should also meet the required grades. It was also agreed that the universities should also be careful not to discriminate against those who are not in a disadvantaged group, and that they should also be given equal consideration.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “We have come to the conclusion that Universities should not give admission priority to disadvantaged groups. We feel that this is because we all agree that the best person for the job should get the job. This means that people should be selected based on their academic achievements, and not on their social status. We feel that people should be given equal opportunities, and that disadvantaged groups should be given the same opportunities as everyone else, and not more. We feel that if people are disadvantaged, then they should be given extra support to help them achieve their goals, but not given an advantage over others. We feel that the best person for the job should get the job, and that people should be selected based on their academic achievements, and not on their social status.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of giving priority to disadvantaged groups in university admissions. The participants felt that if an individual was able to achieve the grades required to get into university, then they should be able to do so regardless of their background. It was felt that if universities did give priority to disadvantaged groups, then this would be unfair on those who did not fit into this category. However, the group did agree that universities should consider all applications equally and that further consideration should be given to those who are disadvantaged. The group felt that universities should be aware that those who are disadvantaged may not have had the same opportunities as others and that this should be taken into account.
