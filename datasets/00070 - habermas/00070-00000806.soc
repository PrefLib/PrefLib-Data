# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, we don't think that a ban on all advertising of fast food is a good idea. We don't think it would be effective in reducing the consumption of fast food as it would be very difficult to implement and enforce. We do think that advertising to children should be more closely monitored and controlled.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that advertising of fast food on the internet and social media should be reduced but not banned. The internet is a global system and it is difficult to control who is exposed to what advertising. Therefore, we should not ban advertising completely as this will lead to an increase in black market advertising and people finding ways to get around the ban. However, we should limit the exposure of advertising to children and vulnerable people who may be more easily influenced by the advertising.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, we don't think we should ban all advertising of fast food on the internet and social media. The internet is a global system, and it would be impossible to ban all advertising. Instead, we should focus on the adverts that target children, and use technology to restrict children from seeing these adverts. We should also consider putting money into subsidizing the purchase of fresh fruit and vegetables to encourage people to buy and consume healthier food.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We don't think that it's a good idea to ban all advertising of fast food on the internet and social media. People have the right to choose what they eat, and should be free to make informed decisions based on their own research. Banning adverts is the wrong approach, and would be very difficult to implement in practice. Instead, we should increase the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables at affordable prices, and invest in the education of people to make them aware of the dangers of eating too much fast food.
