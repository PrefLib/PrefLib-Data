# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Space travel is an important and necessary thing for humanity. It is an important scientific pursuit, but also could be vital for the survival of our species. With a growing population and climate change, we may need to look to other planets for resources or to move to. Therefore I believe the government should support research into space travel, but also encourage private sector companies to get involved and invest their own money. It is also important to invest in the technologies needed to travel in space, such as rockets, so that we can have an independent space programme and not have to rely on other countries for support.”

With a growing population and climate change, we may need to look to other planets for resources or to move to. Therefore I believe the government should support research into space travel, but also encourage private sector companies to get involved and invest their own money. It is important to note that this research may not be able to be completed without government investment, and private sector investment alone is not enough.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Space travel is an important and necessary thing for humanity. It is an important scientific pursuit, but also could be vital for the survival of our species. With a growing population and climate change, we may need to look to other planets for resources or to move to. Therefore I believe the government should support research into space travel, but also encourage private sector companies to get involved and invest their own money. However the government should not be the only ones spending money on it, and we should be looking to help people in this country that are struggling to get by, and trying to tackle the problems we have in the here and now.”
