# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of moving to a form of direct democracy. This is because people should have their say on issues that directly impact their lives. This would also make politicians more accountable for their actions. However, it was recognised that it would slow down the democratic process and that there is a danger that people would not be as informed as they should be on the issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should move to a form of direct democracy as it would allow people to have their say on important issues going on in the UK. It may also encourage people to take more of an interest in politics and current issues and make people feel more involved. It would also make people more actively engaged in politics, so you would hope that they care more about issues that affect everyone. Furthermore,  people would hopefully become more educated about topics and would want to make positive changes for all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Overall the group believe that we should move to a form of direct democracy as it is important that people have their say on important issues going on in the UK. It may also encourage people to take more of an interest in politics and current issues and make people feel more involved. However, it is very important that people are adequately educated on the issues and that the electorate are not swayed by the media to vote in a certain way. The key point here is that people would become more educated on issues. Politicians would also be kept in check and be held more accountable. It is also important that people do not get carried away with direct democracy and that it is used in moderation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although direct democracy is a good idea in theory, it would be extremely impractical in practice. Politicians are elected to make decisions for the electorate and therefore they should be able to do so. It would also slow down the democratic process and adds an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy to an already bloated system.
