# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should remove statues of racist historical figures from public places. This should be done immediately. There should never have been such statues erected in the first place and the fact that they are still in place is atrocious. Some people affected by these figures have to walk past them on a daily basis and feel the pain of their ancestors.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the statues of racist historical figures should be removed from public places. We also believe that a plaque should be placed in their place to inform people of what these historical figures did and to ensure that the history is not forgotten. The plaque should be worded in a way that is not offensive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should remove statues of racist historical figures from public places. This should be done immediately. There should never have been such statues erected in the first place and the fact that they are still in place is atrocious. Some people affected by these figures have to walk past them on a daily basis and feel the pain of their ancestors. The removal of such statues will send an important message that the actions, beliefs and crimes committed by these individuals are abhorrent and intolerable. There is also an argument that the removal of these statues will not erase history and it is important that the people who suffered at their hands are remembered and we need to recognise what happened as they are the facts of human history whether we like it or not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be no statues of racist historical figures in public places. These statues serve as a constant reminder of the oppression and abuse that people of colour have suffered and continue to suffer. We should not be celebrating the achievements of people who committed atrocities and were involved in crimes against humanity.
