# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the idea of making all citizens complete a community service requirement for a set number of hours per year is a good one. It would be beneficial for society as a whole and would help to create a more cohesive society. However, in practice, it would not be possible to implement this. There are too many people who are already working full time jobs, looking after their families, or have other commitments. In addition, it would be unfair to force people to do this who do not want to. Therefore, we do not think that this is a good idea in practice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We don't think that all citizens should be required to complete community service every year. This would be a very difficult thing to enforce and would be very unfair on those who are already working full time, have children or have other commitments. This is something that should be left up to the individual and their own conscience. If they feel they want to help out in the community, they should be free to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be no requirement for ALL citizens to complete community service but there is a strong argument for those individuals who are seeking work to provide this service to the community. This would definitely act as an incentive for the job seekers who are maybe not that keen to work to be more proactive in seeking out a meaning role for themselves.  This in no way implies that all job seekers are lazy and not looking for work and for those who are this would really be seen as a positive to them and any future employer that they are will to work outside their skill set to benefit others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the idea of requiring all citizens to complete community service is not a good idea as it is very unlikely to be workable and is unfair to require citizens who have not committed a crime to do this. However, there is a strong argument for those individuals who are seeking work to provide this service to the community. This would definitely act as an incentive for the job seekers who are maybe not that keen to work to be more proactive in seeking out a meaningful role for themselves.  This in no way implies that all job seekers are lazy and not looking for work and for those who are this would really be seen as a positive to them and any future employer that they are willing to work outside their skill set to benefit others.
