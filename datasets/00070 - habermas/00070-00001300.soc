# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Liverpool and Manchester United are both great football teams. In terms of the ability of their players and the success they have had in recent years, they are very similar. They are also very similar in terms of the quality of their fans and the passion they bring to the game. Liverpool fans are known to be the most passionate fans in the world and Manchester united fans are not far behind. Therefore, we think that it is very difficult to say which team is better. We think that the two teams are very similar and it is very difficult to pick one over the other.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Manchester United are the better team. They have a more rounded team, with world class players in every position. Liverpool have a few world class players but are not as strong across the whole team. Therefore, Manchester United are the better team.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is Manchester United who are a better football team than Liverpool. This is because Manchester United have had more recent success and are more renowned for success in modern times. They have also reached the final of the champions league on more occasions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We agree that Manchester united are the better team, and have been the better team over the last 5 years. We don't think that Liverpool are in a place to challenge Manchester united for the league at the moment. The main reason is that Liverpool are a little weaker defensively and have less depth in their squad than Manchester united. They do have some top quality players and a fantastic manager, but they don't have a team which can challenge Manchester united across the pitch.
