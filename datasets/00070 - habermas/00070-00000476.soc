# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, there should be a law against bullying. It is very difficult to put a law in place but a good system should be put in place where it's reported to the teachers or parents of the child that is being bullied. The bully should then be put into isolation and the parents should be informed of the situation. If the situation persists then it should then be dealt with by a higher authority. The parents should be held responsible for their children's actions, not the teachers. This should be taken off of the teachers and put on the parents where it belongs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, there should be a law against bullying. It is not easy to put a law in place but the right systems should be in place for it to be reported to the teachers or parents of the child that is being bullied. The bully should then be isolated and the parents should be informed. If the bullying continues, it should be dealt with by a higher authority.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, there should not be a law against bullying.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a law against bullying in school. A system should be put in place where the bully is taken out of the classroom and talked to about what they have done. The bully's parents should be made aware of the problem and should try to resolve it. If the problem persists then it should be dealt with by a higher authority.
