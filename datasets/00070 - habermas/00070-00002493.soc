# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, fluoride is beneficial for dental health. However, we feel that it should be up to the individual whether they want fluoride in their water or not. If they want fluoride, they should be able to get it from their dentist. If they don't want fluoride, they should be able to avoid it. We feel that it is the responsibility of the individual and the healthcare system to take care of dental hygiene, and it shouldn't be imposed on everyone without their consent. High levels of fluoride can be dangerous, plus we must consider potential allergies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, fluoride is beneficial for dental health. However, we feel that it should be up to the individual whether they want fluoride in their water or not. If they want fluoride, they should be able to get it from their dentist. If they don't want fluoride, they should be able to avoid it. We feel that it is the responsibility of the individual and the healthcare system to take care of dental hygiene, and it shouldn't be imposed on everyone without their consent. High levels of fluoride can be dangerous, plus we must consider potential allergies. In summary, the final consensus statement is that fluoride is beneficial to dental health, but should be a matter of individual choice. It is the responsibility of the individual and the healthcare system to take care of dental hygiene, and fluoride shouldn't be imposed on everyone without their consent. High levels of fluoride can be dangerous, plus we must consider potential allergies. The participants made the following recommendations: we recommend that people are made more aware of the benefits of fluoride, but also of potential risks and allergies. People should also be made more aware that they can get fluoride from their dentist.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, fluoride has many benefits for dental health and should be added to tap water, however we must be mindful of the potential risks of fluoride toxicity, and should find ways to ensure that people are not drinking too much fluoride. We must also be mindful of people's freedom of choice, and we must be clear about the risks and benefits of fluoride so that people can make their own informed decision.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, fluoride added to water has a positive effect on dental hygiene. However, it is important to consider the potential for negative effects in some individuals due to allergies and/or over-consumption. The issue of consent is also an important factor, and must be addressed to ensure that fluoride is only added to water after public consultation.
