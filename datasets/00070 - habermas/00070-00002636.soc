# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes I think we should. Providing everyone with basic income means we level out the opportunities and provide people with the time, money and opportunity to be happier and create a sustainable income/job and have better health.. I believe it gives everyone the chance including parents, the homes-less, low income families more options and stops people being pushed so hard they are struggling or worse. There is evidence to show in other countries this has worked very successfully. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Basic income schemes have been trialed in several cities and in Finland. In 2023 there is no excuse for people to be living in poverty, especially considering the rise in cost of living. Everyone is entitled to the basic human rights of food, water, and basic accommodations, and a basic income would ideally, if set at an appropriate level, enable most people (if not all) to afford those things. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I believe that we should definitely implement a basic income scheme. I believe that everyone should have the right to food and shelter.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I'm not 100% sure I understand this statement; however if it relates to minimum wage being a reasonable living wage, and benefits being reworked so that they cannot be abused, I am for it. Everyone should be able to afford to live on their income, afford housing, food and transport without having it subsidised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I believe that different careers add different value to society. Should we remove the idea of aiming to be competitive in our jobs it may result in people losing ambition to strive forward in their careers. Also the idea of having a basic income does sound very communist.
