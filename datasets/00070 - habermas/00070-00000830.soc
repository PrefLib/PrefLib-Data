# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group of participants was opposed to the idea of funding coal-fired power stations. They believe that coal is a dirty fuel that has a lot of negative impacts on the environment and human health. The participants all agreed that coal-fired power stations should be replaced by more environmentally friendly power generation methods, such as wind and solar power. However, the participants also agreed that coal-fired power stations should not be replaced immediately. They agreed that coal-fired power stations should be replaced as soon as more environmentally friendly power generation methods are developed and ready to take over. The participants believe that this is the best way to ensure that public charges remain low. The participants agreed that funding should be given to research and development of more environmentally friendly power generation methods. The group also agreed that the money spent on coal-fired power stations should be used to develop more environmentally friendly power generation methods.
