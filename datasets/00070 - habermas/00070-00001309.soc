# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We think that it is crucial for government websites to be accessible to blind people. This is a very important issue that should be addressed as soon as possible. Blind people are not the only people who need to be considered when making websites accessible. In fact, it is much more important to make the internet accessible for people with more severe disabilities. In the UK, we are not doing well in this regard. Therefore, we must ensure that government websites are made accessible, as well as other websites that may become inaccessible in the future. Websites should be accessible to blind people because it is their right to access information. If we do not make these websites accessible, then we are denying them their right. If we make it more difficult for the blind to access information, we are taking their liberty away. It is the government's responsibility to help its citizens, and to exclude them from accessing information would be doing the opposite. Blind people should be able to use the internet to do the same things that we can.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that government websites should be made accessible to people who are blind. This is because it would not be fair to exclude them and deny their rights as citizens. It is crucial that they are able to access information just like anyone else. This would also lead to greater equality, because the blind people are currently disadvantaged compared to other citizens. For these reasons we believe that it is crucial that all government websites are accessible to the blind.

In conclusion, it is the government's responsibility to make the internet accessible to all. If they do not, then they are not fulfilling their job. This means that people with disabilities are excluded. The government should be doing more to help disabled people, and this
