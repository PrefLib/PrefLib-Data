# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Most companies do not have any kind of policy regarding social media, however, I believe a zero-tolerance policy is the way forward provided it is explained to staff exactly how it works ie if they mention they work at company z in any social media correspondence then they will be subject to the full force of the law in the event of making hateful or defamatory statements
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It depends for what kind of job. If we are talking being on your phone whilst important work is meant to be done then yes there should be no tolerance. If say it was something like a barber shop, social media could be used when interacting with clients to help advertise perhaps. for the most part there should be zero tolerance
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It very much depends on what social media is being used & for what reason. For example, if an employee is using snapchat as their way of communicating with their friends/family then that should be allowed as there is no real harm done there. If it was a case of the employee using Facebook, for example, to talk badly about the business or sharing inappropriate things that reflects upon the business as a whole, then it would be understandable to ban the usage of that specific app during work. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, I do not believe that companies should have the ability to insist on an all-out ban on the use of social media by their employees, although I do agree that a company has the right to insist that social media is not used during standard working hours.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I don't think so. Social media is a part of our daily lives and it can have its benefits. Companies should establish guidelines and rules for responsible use. This allows employees to use social media without affecting productivity or confidentiality.
