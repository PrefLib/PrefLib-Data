# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: if by smoking on the job you mean taking a cigarette break in a designated area then yes i think its fine, aslong as it not affecting your workload and you are not taking advantage of those who dont smoke. smoke breaks should come out of your allocated break time though as its unfair on the non-smokers and all workers should be treated the same.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, its a disgusting bad habit and should be banned during the working hours, fine if you want to have it on your unpaid lunchbreak. Allowances for smoking during the working hours should be forbidden, its time wasting and inefficient use of time. Smoking is not a medical condition its a personal choice to smoke and smokers should not be able to just smoke when they feel like it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think that it is a personal choice whether someone smokes or not, however it is not my personal choice to be around people who smoke. If you want to smoke a cigarrette at work then you need to go outside to a designated smoking area where you wont affect anybody else, and non-smokers will know not to go near that area if they dont want to be around cigarette smoke. You should also not get extra time for smoke breaks that people who don't smoke are not able to access. Everyone shouldbe able to have the same amount of time away from their desk.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: As long as you're smoking outside, away from any other non-smokers, I feel that taking 2 minutes to smoke isn't the end of the world. It's something that would never affect me as a non smoker, but if I were an employer, as long as that employee got his/her work done in time, I would have no problem them taking little breaks
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Sure if you go outside and away from the place of work or too a dedicated smoking spot then why not, so long as it's on your break do what you want, If your bothering others by being careless then not so much.
