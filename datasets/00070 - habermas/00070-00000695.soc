# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People should be allowed to use the measurement system they are most comfortable with. However for the purpose of trade and communication between countries, a single system should be used to allow for easy communication.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should be allowed to use the measurement system they find most convenient, but where two systems or areas need to talk to each other, a system should be selected to allow compatability and standard.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, we should not all be using the metric system. Whilst the metric system has many advantages such as it being easier to do calculations because it is based on multiples of 10 rather than the fractions of the imperial system, many people find imperial units more convenient because they just fit better in everyday life. Also many older people have grown up with imperial and are used to using it. Older people find it harder to learn new things so forcing them to switch to metric would make their lives harder and cause them difficulties for no good reason. People should be allowed to use the measurements they want to and not be forced to change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the imperial system of measurement is more suited to everyday life. However, where imperial and metric need to be used in conjunction with each other, the metric system is more convenient.
