# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Social networks are a very nuanced area. In general, the effect of social networks on society is considered negative. However, it is important to recognise that this is a very nuanced area with different social media having different effects. The negative aspects of social networks include: the creation of a society of people in which people spend large amounts of time comparing themselves to others, leading to feelings of depression and a loss of self-esteem. Also, social media can create a forum for people to behave in ways they would not normally, leading to an increase in bullying and abuse online. This can cause psychological damage to people. There are positive aspects of social media: they allow people to reconnect with people they have lost touch with, and create a way of seeing what people around the world are doing, even people you do not know.
