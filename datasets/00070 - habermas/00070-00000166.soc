# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the NHS should not be privatised.  It is very important to the well being of the nation and privatisation would put profit before care and create other problems that are not currently experienced.  The NHS is not ideally run at the moment but it can recover as a public service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The NHS should not be privatised. The NHS should not be privatised. There are major issues with the NHS, but this should not be a reason to make it private.  We feel that by making the NHS private, it will result in people who cannot afford treatment going without. The NHS was founded as a public service for the people and therefore it should remain as such.   There are many ways to improve the NHS and make it more efficient, however privatisation will only make the NHS worse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The NHS should not be privatised. The aim of privatisation is to make profit. Medical care should not be about profit and be available to all. The NHS could be run more efficiently without privatisation and it would also need significantly more funding. The funding could be increased by taxes. The UK has always had a public health service and privatising it would be a disaster.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The NHS should not be privatised as it provides healthcare to all who need it regardless of their income. Privatisation of the NHS could make medical care unaffordable for the lower income and lead to a two-tier system. The NHS does need more funding, however this would result in more jobs and is necessary for the future of the NHS.
