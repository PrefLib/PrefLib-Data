# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although the world is making good progress in increasing the use of renewable energy, we have not yet increased it enough to tangibly benefit the environment.  This is because, although renewable energy is good for the environment, the production of the technology needed to harness the renewable energy can be very damaging to the environment.  In addition, the production of renewable energy is not yet reliable enough to replace fossil fuels.  We will need to increase the use of renewable energy even more, and make it more reliable, before we will see any tangible benefits to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have not increased our use of renewable energy enough to tangibly benefit the environment. This is because although renewable energy sources have increased in popularity, the majority of countries are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels.  This is particularly true for the heavy industrialised nations.  In addition, although renewable energy sources may be beneficial to the environment, the production of the technology to produce renewable energy may cause environmental pollution.  For example, wind farms may involve the mining of precious metals for computer chips.  Finally, the technology isn't reliable because wind and sea energy is variable and scientists haven't yet come up with a way to regulate it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although the use of renewable energy has increased in recent years, it is still not enough to tangibly benefit the environment. The heavy industrialised nations are still using fossil fuels extensively and the world is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for energy. The heavy pollution and toxic gases being released into the atmosphere is still overwhelming the benefits of renewable energy use. We will not see these benefits until harmful emissions are ceased.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have increased our use of renewable energy, however, this has not been enough to tangibly benefit the environment.  We have taken some steps in the right direction, but the steps we have taken are massively negatively impacted by the things that are damaging the environment.  Therefore, more needs to be done to improve the already implemented methods.  The continuous outpouring of pollution, CO2 and toxic gases into the air completely overwhelms any of the benefits seen through green energy initiatives.  We will not see these benefits until harmful emissions are ceased.  Renewable energy use is still limited compared to our overall requirement for energy.  It has a minimal impact on the environment and will not make a huge difference until all countries around the world are fully geared up for renewables use.  The heavy industrialised nations are still using fossil fuel extensively.  Renewable energy may benefit the environment but producing the technology may cause environmental pollution.  Technology such as wind farms, for example, may involve the mining of precious metals for computer chips.  In addition, the technology isn't reliable because wind and sea energy is variable and scientists haven't yet come up with a way to regulate it.
