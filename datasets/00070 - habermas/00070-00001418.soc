# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the legalisation of drugs is a bad idea as it would lead to higher levels of crime and addiction.  However, we would support the legalisation of some drugs for medical use in a controlled way.  We would also support the legalisation of some drugs for recreational use, but only in small quantities and only to people without any criminal records or mental health issues.  The NHS should dispense it so that they can use the revenue for our Healthcare.  This will free up the police to focus on actual crime and more serious issues.

In particular, we would support the legalisation of some drugs for recreational use for people with some mental health issues, like depression or anxiety, who want to use these drugs to help them cope with their issues.

However, we would support the legalisation of some drugs for medical use in a controlled way.  We would also support the legalisation of some drugs for recreational use, but only in small quantities to people without any criminal records or mental health issues.  This would require tighter control over the supply of those drugs.  The NHS should dispense it so that they can use the revenue for our Healthcare.
