# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the police should be allowed to use stop and search powers where they deem it necessary.  They should be trained to use the power with due care and consideration.  Their power must not be abused and should be penalised if it is shown to be so.  However, the use of stop and search should be regulated and police officers should be required to justify the reason why they are executing a stop and search.  There should also be a system where members of the public can challenge the police use of these powers in front of an independent arbiter.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the police should have the power to stop and search people if they have reasonable grounds to do so.  This power should not be abused and should be penalised if it is shown to be so.  This power is an important one in keeping the public safe.  The police are there to protect the public and they need to have the power to stop people if they think they look suspicious.  Unfortunately in this day and age with bombs being planted and people being mowed down in the street the police need to be on a high alert for suspicious people.  The police should be trained to use their power with due care and consideration.  The police should be required to justify the reason why they are executing a stop and search.  There should also be a system where members of the public can challenge the police use of these powers in front of an independent arbiter.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the police should be able to use stop and search powers. However, this power should be used with care and consideration. The police should be trained to use their power with due care and consideration. Their power must not be abused and should be penalised if it is shown to be so. The police should be required to justify the reason why they are executing a stop and search. There should also be a system where members of the public can challenge the police use of these powers in front of an independent arbiter.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although the police have been shown to abuse their powers of stop and search, it is also important to remember that the police are there to protect the public. We believe that stop and search is a very important power that the police have and it is important that they are able to use this power to protect the public. We believe that the police should be able to use this power as they see fit, however they should be required to justify their use of this power to an independent arbiter. We also believe that the police should be trained to use this power with due care and consideration and should be penalised if it is shown that they have abused this power.
