# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, Theresa May was not a good prime minister. She was indecisive and did not have the support of her party. This meant that she struggled to get support for her Brexit deal, which lead to significant delays and uncertainty. Additionally, her government faced criticism for its handling of key social issues, such as healthcare and education. Lastly, her leadership was weak and indecisive, which even led to internal conflicts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Theresa May was not a good Prime Minister. The group felt that she was indecisive and made too many mistakes, which caused the UK a lot of problems.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that May was a poor Prime Minister. While her passion and dedication to the position of Prime Minister was admirable, her time as PM had significant consequences which have affected the UK as a whole. She failed to produce a Brexit deal which could get through Parliament, resulting in a longer period of uncertainty which has affected UK businesses and people living in the UK. Additionally, her poor leadership caused significant infighting within the Conservative Party which undermined the government’s authority. Overall, we believe that May was a poor Prime Minister, whose legacy has had a significant negative impact on the UK.
