# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We believe that immigration is a good thing for the UK as it leads to economic growth and cultural growth. We believe that there should be rules on who is let in, but we should try and take a positive approach to the issue. We also need to do our duty as a stable country and try to provide a safe haven for those less fortunate and provide a place that can give immigrants a chance to improve their lives.”
