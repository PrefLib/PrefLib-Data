# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “I am absolutely in favour of extending life by 50 years. I think we should always advance science and medicine, and life is the most sacred gift creatures have. Whilst I accept it will create other challenges with regards to healthcare and services, these are problems that can be addressed over time. Life and health should always come first in any society. It is the ultimate priority.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although life extension by 50 years would solve many problems by extending human life, the fact that human quality of life decreases as we get older means this will ultimately lead to increased human suffering, so life extension should not be implemented.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be research into prolonging life as it can increase the quality of life of individuals and potentially reduce medical costs. However, any plan to increase the life of individuals must be balanced with the long term impact on the quality of life of the individual, their family and society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of extending the human life span but expressed concerns about the sustainability of resources to pay for an increase in life expectancy. In order to mitigate this concern, we recommended that the extension of life be made possible by using funding from charities and non-governmental organisations.
