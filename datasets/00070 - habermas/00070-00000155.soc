# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Income is something that is very important to everyone in society. The way we allot income is very important to the function of society. We have different ideas of how this should work and what we would like it to do. The consensus is that there should be a basic income provided to all UK citizens by the government. It should be enough to live on. But if you work you should be able to earn more. This should replace the benefits system. Everyone would then be able to work and contribute to the economy, or choose not to and live on the basic income.  There is a cost to the government in implementing this. This will be borne by taxing the rich more. The costs are likely to be recouped by an increase in the GDP. A basic income should be given to all citizens of the UK and it should be enough to live on. If people choose to work they should be able to earn more than the basic income. This will replace the benefits system and all those who are able should work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: A universal basic income is a start to a more fair society. It is a necessary measure to keep a workforce and to ensure that everyone is working towards a goal. It also provides a basic income to people who can then use this to improve their standard of living by working. There are downsides, in that some people will take advantage of the system and not work and some people will abuse the system to improve their own income. The current system of benefits can be improved to ensure that this basic income is not abused.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be a universal basic income in the UK. It is a very hard subject to approach. The people of the UK are very used to their benefits and would be very resistant to change. However the benefits system is broken. It doesn't help people move into work. By having a universal basic income it would remove the benefits system and force people to look for work and get paid a fairer wage. There are many advantages to this. Such as people having a better quality of life, the crime rate will decrease, people would feel more independent, people would have more money and are likely to spend it which in turn will help the economy. There is also a lot of disadvantages to this. People may stop looking for work as the basic income is enough to survive on. It will cost a lot of money to introduce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a universal basic income in the UK. This would replace all benefits and allow for more people to get jobs. There should be an element of this that could be reduced if a person was earning money from a job.
