# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Police should be allowed to stop and search people for drugs if they are in an area known for drug dealing, but only if they are displaying suspicious behaviour.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We think that the police should be allowed to stop and search people for drugs if they are in an area known for drug dealing. We think that it is important for the police to be able to control the crime rate and to make the country a safer place to live. However, we also think that the police should be careful to only stop people who they believe are carrying drugs and not just anyone who is in the area. We also think that people who are stopped and searched should have the right to speak to the police in private, so that no one can hear what they are saying and make assumptions about them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Police should be allowed to stop and search people for drugs even if they are in an area known for drug dealing. This is because even if you have a record, they should be allowed to stop you as you can be arrested and they will have evidence to put you in prison.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the police should be allowed to stop and search people for drugs if they are in an area known for drug dealing. However, it is important that the police have good reason to suspect that the person they are stopping is involved in drug dealing. It is also important that the police are trained to use the power of stop and search appropriately, and that they are able to explain the reasons for the stop and search to the person being searched.
