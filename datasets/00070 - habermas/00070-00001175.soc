# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should not be an age limit above which people cannot get married. If two people want to get married, they should be allowed to do so. It makes no difference if they are 94 years old, if they are in love and want to get married, they should be allowed to do so. The issue of marriage is a private matter and should be left up to the individuals involved. Even if a 85 year old wants to get married to a 25 year old, it is their own private matter and it has nothing to do with anyone else. However, the older person should seek counsel and advice on their decision to marry someone so much younger, to ensure that they are making the right decision.

It makes no difference if they are 94 years old, if they are in love and want to get married, they should be allowed to do so. The issue of marriage is a private matter and should be left up to the individuals involved. Everybody has a right to love no matter their age. We don't interfere in the private lives of couples when they are marrying at a young age, so there is no reason to interfere when they are marrying at an old age.

The issue of marriage is a private matter and should be left up to the individuals involved. Everyone has the right to love no matter their age. We don't condone forced marriages, but we should never stop anyone from making their own decisions in life, including people who are in their old age and who want to get married.

The issue of marriage is a private matter and should be left up to the individuals involved. Even if a 85 year old wants to get married to a 25 year old, it is their own private matter and it has nothing to do with anyone else. We also believe that the issue of marriage should be left to the individuals involved, and that it is no business of the state to set an upper age limit for marriage.
