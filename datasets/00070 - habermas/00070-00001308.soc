# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Businesses should allow workers to take more holidays. However, this should be subject to the agreement of both the employer and employee. This is because it is important that the business is not adversely affected by the increase in holidays. It is also important that employees are not put in a difficult position if they are not able to take the additional holidays.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, businesses should allow workers to take more holidays. It is very clear that workers need more time off. Some workers may not be able to go on holiday because they are saving up or have other commitments such as caring for an elderly relative. But some workers who are able to go on holiday might choose to work in order to earn a little bit more money and this is fine as well. The important thing is to have a holiday and get a break from work to return to it with renewed enthusiasm.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that workers should be allowed to take more holidays. This is because the current work culture is not very conducive to a good work-life balance. There are many different factors that contribute to this, such as the increasing use of technology to stay connected to work. This can lead to people feeling as if they are constantly at work. This can lead to stress, anxiety and other mental health problems. This is not only bad for the workers themselves, but also for their families and their employers. It is in everyone's best interest to have a good work-life balance and we believe that this can be achieved by allowing workers to take more holidays.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We think that businesses should allow workers to take more holidays. If employees are unhappy at work then the business will not be successful and if workers are allowed to take more holidays then they will be happier and this will increase productivity and employee satisfaction.
