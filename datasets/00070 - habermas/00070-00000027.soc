# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that we should stop producing nuclear power. The reasons behind this is the fact that it is not a clean source of energy and is an expensive method of producing energy. It is also a difficult and dangerous method to dispose of nuclear waste. There are other ways that energy can be produced that are clean, efficient and can be easily disposed of.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “I am not in favour of stopping nuclear power production in the UK because we rely too heavily on it and don't have any other options. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to limit the use of nuclear power as much as possible in the future by investing in renewable energy technology.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of stopping the production of nuclear power. We had different opinions on when to stop, and what to replace it with. In order to replace it with renewable energy, we would have to drastically increase the number of wind turbines in the UK, and this would impact on the landscape. It would also take a while for this renewable energy to produce the same power output as the nuclear power plants do now. If nuclear power is stopped now, then it would be necessary to invest in green energy options. This would mean an increased use of solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal and hydroelectric power. This would mean more reliance on technology which could be problematic, and would mean that there would be an increase in the number of people using these methods of power, which would also increase the risk of them being stolen. A transition from nuclear to renewable energy would also need to be carried out over a longer period of time to allow the nation to adjust to the changes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should continue producing nuclear power in the UK. However, we should be using this power for medical reasons rather than just the power supply of homes.
