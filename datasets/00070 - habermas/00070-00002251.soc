# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, children should not be automatically registered with a religion. Children should be free to develop their own thoughts and feelings about religion rather than being forced to adopt one which may contradict their future beliefs. The group felt that it is imperative that everyone has a choice, children can be brought up around a particular religion but they have the right to change their minds when older. The group felt that it is fine for children to practice a religion with their family or in their homes. However, they should not be registered until this is a decision they can make for themselves. They may grow up to form different opinions from their family which would be made more difficult if their family had officially registered them as a certain religion.
