# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The minimum wage should be increased to £15 per hour. We live in a society where the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. We believe that the minimum wage should be increased to £15 per hour as this would help the low income families and would allow them to live a better life. The rise in minimum wage would help the low income families be able to afford the basics such as food and heating in their homes. By increasing the minimum wage this would also encourage a greater number of people to join the workforce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The minimum wage should be raised to £15 per hour. This will ensure that people who work hard to support themselves and their families can live comfortably and will also improve the economy as more people will be able to afford goods and services.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the minimum wage should be increased to £15 per hour, as this will increase the quality of life of the people, increase the economy, and improve the labour market.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of raising the minimum wage to £15 per hour. However, they recognised that it was a difficult question and that there were many complexities and nuances to the question. The group agreed that a rise in minimum wage would be a positive step for society. It would help lift people out of poverty and improve the quality of life for many people. It would also help reduce the wage gap between the rich and the poor in society. The group also discussed the impact on small businesses and agreed that the government should provide support to small businesses to ensure they are able to survive and thrive with a rise in minimum wage.
