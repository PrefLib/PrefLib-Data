# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We are facing a climate emergency. The evidence for man-made climate change is overwhelming from numerous research studies conducted by global experts. If we fail to treat this as an emergency then the effects will be devastating as we will miss opportunities to reverse the damage we are causing to the planet. The issue is getting worse, as an idea exists that we should just leave it to the next generation. The issue is also caused by large corporations, and governments therefore need to crack down on how they act. We should be making more efforts to prevent the climate getting worse but we are instead maintaining the status quo which means that not only is the climate going to continue changing in drastic ways, but it will change at an increasingly fast rate. Absolutely, average worldwide temperatures are higher than ever. This is causing a huge amount of damage to humans, animals, and habitats. We are at a crucial point where urgent action is needed, otherwise we could make our planet an inhospitable place to live.
