# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the government should not require all people to pay for some form of private health insurance. The NHS is a vital part of British life, and many people are not in a position to pay for private health insurance. The NHS is already stretched and underfunded, and requiring people to pay for private health insurance would not necessarily improve the situation. There are some people who abuse the system, but it would be better to find a way to stop this abuse rather than requiring everyone to pay for private health insurance. The consensus was strongly in favour of this opinion. Participants 3 and 5 strongly agreed with this, and participants 1 and 4 agreed, although participants 1 and 4 said that they would personally be open to some forms of health insurance being chargeable, e.g. hospital visits. The group opinion does not rule out charges for things like hospital visits as an option for reducing the burden on the NHS, but says that we should find a way of stopping people who abuse the NHS before taking such steps. The focus group gave an insight into how to come to a consensus, i.e. how to draw out the arguments from different points of view and highlight what is common between different opinions, then use this common ground
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, the government should not require all people to pay for some form of private health insurance. The NHS is a vital part of British life and already struggles to serve everyone adequately. Some people may try to abuse the system, but a better solution would be to find a way to stop this abuse, rather than requiring everyone to pay for private health insurance. One example of a way to deal with abuse is by having a penalty for wasting the time of frontline NHS workers when it is clear there is no urgent medical need. We feel this would be more efficient and fairer than requiring everyone to pay for private insurance.

There are some people who abuse the system, but it would be better to find a way to stop this abuse rather than requiring everyone to pay for private health insurance. We would like to see the NHS funded properly, and have adequate resources to be able to meet all of the needs of the population. We think that the government should be looking at ways to stop people abusing the system, and should not require people to pay for private health insurance on top of the taxes that they already pay.

The government should focus on improving the NHS, rather than requiring people to pay for private health insurance.
