# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of tax-free shopping but thought that it should be limited to once a year per customer, rather than once a month as it is at the moment. Conclusion In conclusion, the results of this research showed that people in Ireland support tax-free shopping.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Tax free shopping is a good thing for the economy, and gives the traveller an opportunity to buy certain goods that the government of the country tax sometimes excessively. Banning it will lead to a lot of angry people and should be avoided.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should ban tax-free shopping, as it encourages people to buy more than they need. Taxes are already too high. We should not make this easier for the government. The government should live within its means.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, tax free shopping should not be banned, for the following reasons: - It is a perk of international travel - It is difficult to exploit - It is a bit of a boon for the average person travelling - It gives the traveller an opportunity to buy certain goods that the government of the country tax sometimes excessively - I have slight reservations as to it being banned as i feel my own government take enough money in taxes as it is - It saves me money - I would miss it should it be taken away
