# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the government should provide a basic income to all citizens, and that this income should be provided on a sliding scale based on a number of different factors, including age, employment status, income levels, and skills. It is our view that a basic income could work in this country, and that it would help to drive the economy by creating a basic level of security for all citizens. It would allow people to make better decisions about their future, to spend money on things that are important to them, and to use their skills and talents to add to their basic income, in order to gain greater benefits and financial freedom. It would be fair and allow all citizens to have a more equal playing field, where people can be judged on the value of their skills and knowledge rather than by their economic status.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that a basic income should be provided by the government to all citizens. Every individual will receive the same basic income, which would allow for a basic standard of living to be provided to all regardless of race, creed, sexual orientation, disability, age, employment status or skill level. It is our view that a basic income would work in this country, and that it would help to drive the economy by creating a basic level of security for all citizens. It would allow people to make better decisions about their future, to spend money on things that are important to them, and to use their skills and talents to add to their basic income, in order to gain greater benefits and financial freedom. It would be fair and allow all citizens to have a more equal playing field, where people can be judged on the value of their ideas, personalities, and characters rather than by their economic status.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final
