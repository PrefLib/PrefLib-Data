# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Sex education is an important part of a child's education. It is important that children are taught about the importance of consent, and the legal age of consent. Children should also be taught about the importance of using contraception and protection, and the risks of unprotected sex. Children should be taught about the different forms of contraception available, and how to access them. Children should also be taught about different sexually transmitted diseases, and how to prevent them. Children should also be taught about periods, and the importance of menstrual hygiene. Children should also be taught about the different forms of gender and sexuality, and that it is ok to be who you are. Children should also be taught about the different forms of relationships, and that there is no right or wrong way to be in a relationship.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Schools should teach sex education but only to children over the age of 14. This should be taught by both male and female teachers and in an inclusive way to make sure everyone is comfortable. Children should be educated on safe sex and their rights around sex.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Sex education is very important in schools. We feel that the current sex education is very outdated and does not reflect the current society. We feel that it is important that sex education is taught in schools to allow children to be informed and make their own decisions. We feel that sex education should be taught in primary schools to allow children to be aware of their bodies and the changes that are happening. We also feel that sex education should be taught in secondary schools to allow children to be aware of the dangers and how to protect themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We think that sex education should be taught in all secondary schools and that it should be part of the school curriculum. This is because it would help young people make more informed decisions in life, and it would give them the opportunity to explore different sexualities and talk about topics which can be uncomfortable. It is also important that they know how to use protection so that they can avoid pregnancy and STDs. It is important that young people understand that they should not feel pressured into having sex with someone else and that they know how to act appropriately around others. It would also give children the opportunity to talk about subjects which can be hard to talk about and which they do not feel comfortable talking to their parents about.
