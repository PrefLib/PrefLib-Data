# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “In general, the group was in favour of a ban on the sale of all non-electric cars. However, it was recognised that this would not be possible immediately. The group also recognised that many people would not be able to afford an electric car, and that this would be unfair. Therefore, the group came to the following consensus opinion: In the long term, the sale of all non-electric cars should be banned. The group agrees that there is not enough infrastructure in place to do this now. In the short term, we suggest the following: the sale of diesel cars should be banned, as these vehicles produce the most toxic emissions. The sale of petrol cars should also be reduced, but not banned. The government should provide more electric car charging points, and make it easier for people to install them in their homes. The government should also provide more financial support for people who want to buy electric cars, but cannot afford them. Finally, the government should provide financial support for people who want to convert their existing cars to electric, as this would also reduce the number of non-electric cars on the road.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “In general, the group was in favour of a ban on the sale of non-electric cars.
