# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Our current immigration policy is not perfect, but could be a lot worse. We accept that there needs to be restrictions, but feel that a great deal more respect needs to be shown to immigrants and refugees. We think that, in the majority of cases, refugees have made the decision to risk everything to come here out of desperation and, to a degree, that desperation must be respected. However, we also feel that our current government is a little too accepting of the large numbers of immigrants we have in the UK, particularly from Europe, and would like to see these numbers reduced to give a more equal distribution of employment opportunities for all. We think that immigrants are made to feel as if they are a burden, rather than an asset to our society and that more can be done to help them integrate and contribute. In particular, we would like to see our government make more of an effort to remove people who are in the country illegally. We think that the financial burden on our health service, schools and police force is getting too great and that more can be done to remove those who are not entitled to stay.
