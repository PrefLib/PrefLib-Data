# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although wild animals have been bred in captivity, it is still unfair to the animal to be kept as a pet, they should be in an area similar to the wild and away from human contact. These animals are dangerous to humans and it would not be fair to the animal to keep it as a pet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No wild animal should be kept as a pet, even if bred in captivity. A wild animal, even if semi domesticated will still have the instincts of its natural behaviours which presents a danger to any human. It is also cruel to keep a wild animal as a pet. The animal is taken away from its natural habitat and is forced to live in a home where it is not suited to. The animal may also become aggressive and lash out at its owners or anyone who comes into contact with it. This could result in injury or death. The animal may also become depressed and stressed as it is not living in its natural habitat. This could also result in injury or death.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that it is wrong to keep a wild animal as a pet. Animals such as a wildcat should not be kept in an environment where it does not have the freedom to roam, and they should not be treated as a pet because that is not their nature. The keeping of wild animals as pets is wrong for a number of reasons. It is cruel to the animal, as well as the owner. An animal such as a tiger should not be confined to the small space of a house or a garden. The tiger should be in a large enclosure where it can roam freely. Even if a wild animal is bred in captivity, it is cruel to keep it in such a small space. It is also dangerous to keep a wild animal in a house as it is not safe to the owner or the animal itself. Wild animals such as tigers and leopards can be unpredictable and could easily attack someone in the house, which would be extremely dangerous. It is also dangerous to the animal. There have been cases of pet owners who have shot their pet lions, as well as bears, as they were scared of the animal. An animal such as a tiger is not suitable to be kept as a pet, and I
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, it is not okay to keep a wild animal as a pet, even if it has been bred in captivity. This is because it is not fair on the animal to be kept as a pet and it will always have its natural instincts which could result in human harm. We understand the need for sanctuaries and zoos where these animals may not survive in the wild but here they are still kept away from close human interaction because they are still dangerous. It just isn't fair to the animal to be kept as a pet usually in a small home.
