# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think that it is important for inclusivity of everybody that all websites the government run are accessible to the blind. Blind people have just as much right to access information as anybody else, and also government websites usually have important information, or services on them such as benefits, passports etc which blind people should not be restricted to access. It is also very easy in todays modern age to make websites accessible to blind people with text readers or AI integrated chatbots to help people navigate the website. It is not important to me personally as I am not blind (or non of my family) but I could be made blind at any time by an accident and would want to be able to access websites easily if that happened.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Government information websites need to be accessible by all in different formats that can be consumed. We all have the right to this information.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think government websites should be made accessible to everyone, not just the blind. Blind people are still people who are affected by government decisions, therefore they and everyone else, have a right to access what should always be public information.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes it's only right to let all people no matter what disability they may have the same access to the right information. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: yes, but not just government websites, all websites should be made accessible to the blind. in this day and age with all the modern technology everything should be accessible.
