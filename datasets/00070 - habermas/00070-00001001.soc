# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the age for leaving school should not be reduced to 16. Education is a vital part of everyone's development. It teaches you great skills and once one becomes 18, s/he can choose whether they want to continue their education or start working. Sixteen is a bit too early to leave school and make life-changing decisions. If students remain in education until 18, they have more time to learn, to mature, to be able to make sound decisions. However, the age for leaving school should be altered based on achievement and careers advice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the conclusion that the age for leaving school should not be reduced from 18 to 16. The reasons for this are as follows: 16 is too young to make such an important decision as to whether you want to continue in education or start working. It is very likely that at 16 years old, a child is not mature enough to make such a decision and will not have the life experience to be able to make a sound decision. If the leaving age is reduced to 16, this will result in higher numbers of children out of education and out of employment as they simply will not know what to do with their lives.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, the age for leaving school should not be reduced from 18 to 16. There are many reasons for this. Firstly, 16 is too young to be making important life-changing decisions. At this age, one may not be mature enough to know what they want to do with their life and if they do know, they may change their mind in a few years time. Also, education is a vital part of everyone's development. It teaches you great skills and once one becomes 18, s/he can choose whether they want to continue their education or start working. Another point is that by keeping children in school until 18 years old we are encouraging good education and helping them get ready for adult life. Also, by keeping children in school until 18 years old we are helping them to make sound decisions and to be able to make a living.
