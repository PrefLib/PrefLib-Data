# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A multi-party government is the best option for a society.  This is because all groups in society will be represented, and this means that the government is more likely to reflect the views of society as a whole.  It also means that a party can not get carried away with what they feel is appropriate for the whole of society.  However, it is important to remember that a multi-party government is also more likely to take a long time to make decisions, as all parties need to agree.  This can cause issues if a quick decision is needed.
