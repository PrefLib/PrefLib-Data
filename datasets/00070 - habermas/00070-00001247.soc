# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We are facing a climate emergency. The evidence for man-made climate change is overwhelming from numerous research studies conducted by global experts. If we fail to treat this an as emergency then the effects will be devastating as we will miss opportunities to reverse the damage we are causing to the planet. The issue is also getting worse, with a stigma rising that we should just leave it to the next generation. The issue is also caused by large corporations, and governments therefore need to crack down on how they act. We should be making more efforts to prevent the climate getting worse but we are instead maintaining the status quo which means that not only is the climate going to continue changing in drastic ways, but it will change at an increasingly fast rate. Absolutely, average worldwide temperatures are higher than ever. This is causing a huge amount of damage to humans, animals, and habitats. We are at a crucial point where urgent action is needed, otherwise we could make our planet an inhospitable place to live.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Climate change is the most important challenge facing humanity and we need to make more effort now to prevent it. We are facing a climate emergency and need to take more rapid action now to ensure the future survival of life on the planet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Climate change is the most important challenge facing humanity and we need to take more rapid action now to ensure the future survival of life on the planet. The evidence for man-made climate change is overwhelming from numerous research studies conducted by global experts. If we fail to treat this as an emergency then the effects will be devastating as we will miss opportunities to reverse the damage we are causing to the planet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In my opinion, we are facing a climate emergency. The consequences of not taking action are too great to risk. We are already seeing some of the effects of climate change on our weather and this is only going to get worse. The consensus among the scientific community is that climate change is man-made. This means that the burden of responsibility falls on us to take action. While there are challenges, there are also solutions that can be implemented and are being implemented. These solutions need to be more ambitious, as well as being more widely implemented. The risks are too great to sit back and do nothing.
