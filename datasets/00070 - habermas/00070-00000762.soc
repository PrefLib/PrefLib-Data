# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should have access to a computer, but it is not necessary for them to have their own.  They should have access to a computer in order to keep up with the modern world and for educational purposes.  Having a computer can be a privilege but there are also risks that come with it.  The parents or guardians of the children should be the ones who regulate what content they are exposed to.  Children should be taught how to use a computer properly and how to stay safe on the internet.  It is important for children to learn how to use a computer because it is a skill that will be useful in their future careers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Children should have access to a computer from an early age, but it is up to the individual parent or guardian to decide whether their child should have their own computer. This is because children can be exposed to harmful content and it is up to the parent or guardian to regulate this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should have access to a computer, but the decision to own one should be up to the individual parent or guardian.  This is because there are many risks associated with owning a computer, including being exposed to harmful content, and children should not be exposed to this unless their parents or guardians are comfortable with it.  Children should have access to a computer in order to access educational resources and other beneficial content, but should not be forced to own one.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, children should have access to a computer. However, it is important that they are protected from harmful content and that they do not become addicted to the computer. Therefore, parents and guardians should be responsible for the safety of their children, and the government should provide assistance to those who cannot afford to provide a computer for their children.
