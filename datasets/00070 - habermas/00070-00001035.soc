# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should ban plastic bags as they are damaging to the environment. Businesses should be required to provide an alternative that is renewable. This could be paper or compostable carrier bags. People need to be encouraged to remember to bring their own bags when they go shopping. A small charge for the bags provided at the till could be used to encourage this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of banning plastic bags. However, we felt that this would be a difficult thing to enforce. Therefore, we believe that the best way to tackle this problem would be to increase the price of plastic bags. This would make people think twice about whether they really need one, and hopefully reduce the number of bags that are used. The revenue from this tax could be used to fund research into more environmentally friendly alternatives to plastic bags.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of banning plastic bags. However, there were concerns that a ban would not be effective if a renewable alternative was not provided. There was also concern that if bags for life were made available, people would just buy them every time they went shopping, and so would not be a solution to the problem. Therefore, the group came to the consensus that plastic bags should be banned, but with the proviso that renewable alternatives are provided.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should ban plastic bags. They are a major source of pollution and do untold damage to the environment. They are also dangerous to wildlife. There are plenty of alternatives including paper, cloth, cardboard and biodegradable bags. We should also be encouraging people to use reusable bags.
