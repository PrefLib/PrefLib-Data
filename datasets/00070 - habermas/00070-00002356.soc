# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the government funding a high-speed rail line from London to Birmingham. The group believed that it would be beneficial for the people of England, and would be a good way to improve infrastructure in the country. However, the group also believed that the government should not fund the project if it meant that other, more important, areas of public spending would have to be cut. The group believed that the NHS was a higher priority than the rail line, and so should not be cut to fund the project. The group also believed that the rail line should be built in a way that meant that it would be cost-effective to run, and so that it would not be a burden on the taxpayer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the government funding the high speed rail line. The reasons for this were that it would benefit a lot of people, would be more ecological than travelling by car, would be useful for commuters, and would be a good alternative to driving. The group was also in favour of the government funding this because it would be a good investment for the future, as the line would be useful for many years to come. However, the group was also in favour of the government funding other things as well, such as the NHS, and was concerned about the cost of the line and how this would be paid for. The group was also concerned about the effect of the line on the local environment, and whether this would be detrimental.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the government should fund a high-speed rail line from London to Birmingham. The reason for this is that it would benefit a large number of people, especially those who commute to London for work. It would also be more environmentally friendly than travelling by car. However, we also think that the government should make sure that the costs of running the rail line are low, so that it is cheaper to travel by train than by car. We also think that the government should make sure that the costs of building the rail line are not too high, and that they are not passed on to the general public in the form of higher taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that the government should fund a high-speed rail line from London to Birmingham. The reason for this is that it would benefit a large number of people who commute to Birmingham for work, and would also be more environmentally friendly than driving. However, we think that it is important to ensure that the costs are kept as low as possible, so that it is affordable for people to use the service. We also think that it is important to ensure that the line is built in the most efficient way possible, to avoid any unnecessary delays or cost overruns.
