# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The NHS is in the public's mind at the moment and is always thought of as underfunded, which it is. However, it is equally important to give people the tools to lead happy and fulfilling lives and this can be achieved through education. Education and health are intertwined; the more educated a person is, the more likely they are to understand and take care of their own health. The current state of the NHS is down to a lack of money, which means a lack of qualified staff and up to date technology. It is imperative that the government ensures that this lack of money does not extend to schools. Teachers are currently having to spend money out of their own pockets in order to provide the children with the materials they need to learn effectively. This is not sustainable. The money given to schools does not reflect how important education is. The government need to provide the schools with the money they need to run effectively, the same way the government needs to provide the NHS with the money it needs to run effectively.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “The government should spend more money on healthcare because it is a fundamental right that people should be able to access healthcare and the NHS is in crisis.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should spend more on healthcare.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of more money being spent on health care. This is because education is something that can be accessed by everyone, and if someone really wants to be educated, they can make it happen for themselves. However, health care is something that is essential for everyone, and the government has a duty to provide it. The NHS is currently struggling, and if more money is not spent on it, the quality of health care will continue to decrease. This is something that cannot be allowed to happen. The NHS is a vital part of British society, and it is something that everyone should have access to. The NHS is also something that is unique to Britain, and so it is something that should be protected and supported.
