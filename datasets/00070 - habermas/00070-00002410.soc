# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, this will allow a way for drugs to enter the community in a legal way and people can be abuse the system.  I don't think we should allow doctors to precribe illegal drugs such as heorion to addicts.  Why?  because I think in the long run there will be too much of a profit motive and this actually will be a way for the privasation of a part of the NHS via the back door.  Absolutely not as why should they have the power to do that as it could be abused and also some doctors may write out prescriptions for so called friends . Illegal drugs are illegal for a reason and can be very dangerous so no person should be able to make that decision. I definitely would not trust doctors to be be able to give these types of prescriptions.
