# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There are benefits to eating meat, but there are also benefits to not eating meat. Meat provides important nutrients that are essential for our health, but there are also alternative sources for these. Meat can be harmful to the environment, but it is also an important part of the economy and culture of many countries. There are arguments for not eating meat, but I think these are too restrictive and ultimately harmful for humans. I think we should reduce our meat consumption, but not eliminate it completely. I think we should consume good quality meat, but not too much of it. I think we should be more aware of where our meat comes from and how it is produced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of eating meat. However, we all agreed that we eat too much meat, and that this needs to be reduced. We also agreed that we should eat more sustainable meat, and that we should reduce the amount of meat we eat that comes from factory farming. We all agreed that eating meat is an important part of a balanced diet, and that we should continue to eat meat, but in moderation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It was agreed that the group are all animal lovers and it was noted that there is an ethical argument for not eating meat. We also acknowledge that a huge amount of meat is wasted and the amount of animals slaughtered to provide the amount of meat that is eaten is very high. We would all like to see less meat being wasted and more ethical farming and slaughtering practices. It was also noted that meat provides many vital nutrients and cutting it out of a diet completely would leave many people unhealthily malnourished. We agreed that eating too much meat is bad for your health and it can be difficult to find a healthy balance. In terms of sustainability, there was disagreement about whether or not it was possible to continue eating meat sustainably, and that some would like to reduce their meat consumption and some would not. It was noted that meat is a huge part of many people’s diet, particularly in poorer communities, and therefore cutting out meat altogether could cause problems in those communities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that we should be eating meat. We recognise that meat can provide us with important nutrients and that without meat, we would be at risk of deficiencies in certain key nutrients. However, we feel that it is important to moderate our meat consumption. Too much meat can lead to health problems such as heart disease and high blood pressure. Moreover, excessive meat consumption is bad for the environment, with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions from the production and processing of meat. We also feel that if you choose to eat meat, you should eat the best quality meat that you can, choosing organic or ethically-sourced meat where possible.
