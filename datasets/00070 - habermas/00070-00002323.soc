# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the government spending more on improving the railway network. We thought that it was necessary to do this to encourage more people to use trains as a form of transport and in doing so reduce the amount of pollution being emitted by other forms of transport such as cars and planes. We also thought that this would be beneficial for the economy as it would improve the efficiency of the network and reduce the amount of time it takes to travel to certain places. We felt that the current system was run down and not particularly efficient. However, we did acknowledge that this was not the most important issue that the government is facing at the moment and that it should not be prioritised over other more important issues such as immigration and healthcare.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the government spending more on improving the railway network. The group felt that the current network is inefficient and in need of updating. A better network would mean that using the rail system would be more attractive to passengers and increase train usage. This would have environmental benefits. However, the group felt that the government should prioritise other issues first such as inflation, healthcare and immigration. They felt that improvements to the railway network are necessary to encourage the public to take trains and feel they are getting their money's worth out of this service. In doing so people will also be encouraged to consider more environmentally friendly ways of moving around the country as trains emit fewer emissions than cars or planes. Currently, there is a lack of incentive to do so in the UK as train journeys are expensive and illogical compared to other methods of transport. Poor infrastructure can mean long routes when trying to reach certain parts of the country. Schemes such as railcard reduce fares but even with the discount journeys are still too expensive compared to for example flights.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the railway network in the UK is in a poor state and in desperate need of updating. This is especially true in comparison with other countries. The network needs to be improved in order to encourage passengers to use it. A better system would be more attractive to passengers and increase train usage. This would have environmental benefits. The government should prioritise other issues such as inflation, healthcare and immigration.
