# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It should not be legal for under 18's to buy e-cigarettes because they are not proven to be less harmful than traditional cigarettes, and there are too many unknowns about their long term use. The debate demonstrated how a discussion can lead to a different view to that originally held by the participants.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the safety of e-cigarettes is not known and their use should be limited until their long-term effects are known. However, if a person is smoking tobacco cigarettes, e-cigarettes are known to be less dangerous than tobacco cigarettes and should be promoted. The issue is complicated and should be discussed in more detail.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should treat e-cigarettes as we do with tobacco and cigarettes and make it illegal for people under 18 to purchase them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We do not feel that e-cigarettes should be available to under 18s. We are aware of many e-cigarettes containing nicotine and that these have not been properly regulated. There is also no proof that they are safe and we do not know of the long term effects of e-cigarettes on health. Therefore we feel it is the duty of the government to protect young people from the potential harm that could be caused from e-cigarettes.
