# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, we believe that there should be greater controls over the use of pesticides as they can be dangerous and detrimental to the environment and our health. Pesticides can also have a negative impact on wildlife. However, there should be no outright ban on the use of pesticides as we can see that in some circumstances, their use can be advantageous. Pesticides can be very useful in that they can improve crop yield and increase the longevity of crops which can be beneficial to developing countries and improve the food security of the population. Therefore, it is important to come up with an appropriate balance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Pesticides have a detrimental impact on the environment. They can cause cancer in humans and kill birds, insects and other animals. To solve this problem we need greater controls over the use of pesticides and should make it a punishable offence to use them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Greater controls should be implemented on the use of pesticides, particularly with regard to those that have been proven to cause damage to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be greater controls over the use of pesticides. Pesticides can often kill parts of wildlife that are not harmful such as insects that are eaten by other animals that don't actually harm crops, thereby uprooting the entire local food chain. Also thinking of DDT from the 1970s, some pesticides can cause birth defects and cancer in children which is even more problematic than damage to local wildlife.
