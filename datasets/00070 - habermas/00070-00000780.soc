# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the idea of providing free electricity to every UK citizen is not a good idea. This is because, firstly, the country is already in a lot of debt. Secondly, it will likely result in an unfair taxation system. Thirdly, it will encourage some to waste electricity since there would be no financial consequences to not being careful with energy use since you are not paying for it causing more global warming and cost. Fourthly, it would likely bankrupt the country since it would have to be funded somehow and the country is already in a massive amount of post covid debt. Fifthly, it would be a politicians nightmare to create tax system to pay for everyone's electricity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of providing free electricity for every UK citizen. However, there were concerns that such a policy would lead to the government going into more debt, which would have a negative impact on the economy in the long term. The group also agreed that providing free electricity for every UK citizen would be a very difficult policy to implement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the idea of free electricity for everyone is a good idea, however, there are some practicalities to consider. One is that it would be difficult to implement in practice, as it is not clear how the scheme would be funded and also how it would be implemented. Secondly, it is not clear how free electricity would be provided for everyone. There are some people in the UK who live in very rural areas and therefore it would be difficult to provide electricity to them. Also, some people are not responsible with electricity and would waste it if it was free, which would not be good for the environment. However, the group was in favour of free electricity for those in fuel poverty, as they would benefit the most.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that we do not think it is a good idea to provide every UK citizen with free electricity for their homes. Although it may be a very tempting idea, there are many factors that would make this idea difficult to implement. One of these factors is that there would be an increase in energy use, especially in households that are not energy efficient. If everyone in the UK was provided with free electricity, it would be very difficult to control the amount of energy being used. Another factor is that the UK would be bankrupt. This is because there would be no way to pay for the electricity that everyone is using. This is because the cost of electricity would be astronomical. Also, the UK is already in a lot of debt, so it would be very difficult to provide free electricity. In conclusion, we do not think that it is a good idea to provide every UK citizen with free electricity for their homes.
