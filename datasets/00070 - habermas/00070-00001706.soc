# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We do not believe that overseas companies should be banned from bidding on infrastructure projects. We believe that the free market should be allowed to operate and that the best bid should win the contract. We do however believe that there should be some regulation in place to ensure that British companies are prioritised. This is to help boost the income of British companies, keep money in the British economy and also give employment to British people. We also believe that there are times where overseas companies will be important to British infrastructure, for example when they perform a specialist service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “I feel that the UK should not ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. More important priorities for me are ensuring that a winning bid will make best use of taxpayer money and will safely deliver new infrastructure that will last for a long time.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “We feel that the UK should not ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. However, the government should place a priority on ensuring that winning bids are from companies who have the greatest technical capacity to deliver. Furthermore, to ensure that UK companies are given a fair opportunity to win the contracts, all projects should be listed in the public sector and all relevant documentation should be made publicly available. This would allow companies to enter a more competitive market place and make the bidding process more efficient. Moreover, it would also encourage the development of new technology in the UK which could also be exported to other countries and boost the economy.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Opinion from Group: We feel that overseas companies should be banned from bidding on infrastructure projects, as this would boost the British economy and enable employment opportunities for the British population.
