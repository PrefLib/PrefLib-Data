# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I don't have a strong opinion either way. Although I was a student years ago. I'm not sure what current students are facing, whether is enough support already or if it is needed. There are some issues that cause pressures on students such as cost of living and inflation, and covid causing a dip in education, so may err on the side of for. But it doesn't matter to me either way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I think so. I really do not think that accessing the mental health support is very easy nor confidential for students. As a student myself I feel judged when trying to access any support for my mental health and I think this is wrong.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I believe there should be money for mental health and a support system in place for everyone not just students but I believe the universities or education sites should take some responsibility for their students also not just the govt. ploughing extra funding in. There should be a system of access, support and help from the place of education as a first point of call funded by them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Students are under a lot of pressure to perform. There are insufficient resources available at schools, colleges and universities, although they do their best. More money needs to be spent to ensure that there is a safety net for students. Many university students are away from home and may not have support networks in place.
