# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a higher minimum wage. The current minimum wage is not sufficient for a good quality of life, and with increasing costs of living and the cost of living crisis, we need to ensure people have enough money to consume and purchase goods and services, helping out the economy. What people get paid right now is not sufficient for a good quality of life, but also to ensure we do not enter recession. Disposable income is shrinking and these are the people that work and then spend everything they have with little savings to fall back on and that does help out the economy but now these people have less to spend and if they continue they are likely to fall into debt with interest rates rising sharply and it would help with growth and to prevent a worse recession which would only make the situation worse for the poorest workers and will see wages going in the wrong direction and will make inequality even worse and we will be going backwards rather than forwards so the minimum wage should be increased at least in line with inflation otherwise they will be getting poorer in real terms.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a higher minimum wage. The current minimum wage is not sufficient for a good quality of life, and with increasing costs of living and the cost of living crisis, we need to ensure people have enough money to consume and purchase goods and services, helping out the economy. The benefits that people on minimum wage receive should not be restricted; it is the government supporting job creation. If all of our bills can be raised by inflation once a year then the minimum wage and the minimum income being paid to the poorest workers should do the same because otherwise the poorest workers in our society will continue to get poorer and poorer and inequality will only continue to get worse and then clearly work wouldn't be paying and we would be going backwards rather than forwards.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be a higher minimum wage, as the current minimum wage is not sufficient for a good quality of life. In the face of the rising costs of living and the cost of living crisis, we need to ensure people have enough money to consume and purchase goods and services, helping out the economy. Even though some people on the minimum wage may receive benefits as well, those benefits should not be restricted as it is supporting job creation. What people get paid right now is not sufficient for a good quality of life, but also to ensure we do not enter recession. If all of our bills can be raised by inflation once a year then the minimum wage and the minimum income being paid to the poorest workers should do the same because otherwise the poorest workers in our society will continue to get poorer and poorer and inequality will only continue to get worse and then clearly work wouldn't be paying and we would be going backwards rather than forwards.

The current minimum wage is not sufficient for a good quality of life, and with increasing costs of living and the cost of living crisis, we need to ensure people have enough money to consume and purchase goods and services, helping out the economy. What people get paid right now is not sufficient for a good quality of life, but also to ensure we do not enter recession.

This would require people to either pay more for the same output as before, or to get rid of some of their workers or pay their remaining workers more. Also, there are those on benefits that currently help increase spending in the economy, they cannot work themselves and will therefore only get poorer with higher inflation.
