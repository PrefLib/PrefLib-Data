# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that single use plastics, polystyrene, and other items of that kind should be banned as soon as possible. However, this ban should be more focused on companies and the commercial use of single use items, and not as much on the end consumer. This is because we feel that the consumer has a greater responsibility to ensure they dispose of single use items in the correct way. The public sector should be enforcing the ban on the companies using these single use items, and publicising the best ways to use alternatives to single use items. This will hopefully discourage businesses from using single use items and, in turn, consumers will have to pay more for them if they want to continue using them. This will also discourage consumers from buying single use items in the first place, and instead force them to look for alternative products. We also believe that there should be a government incentive for companies and the public to use alternatives to single use items, such as a tax break or reduced business rates.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a ban on all single use plates and cutlery that are made from non-recyclable or non-biodegradable materials. This would ensure that the items that are banned are those that are the most harmful to the environment. The ban should be enforced by the government, and the use of such plates and cutlery should be made illegal. The ban should be rolled out in stages, to allow businesses to adapt and find alternative products to use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although some single use plates and cutlery are produced sustainably, there is a huge volume of the items produced unsustainably and as such a ban on the unsustainable items should be imposed. This would help prevent these items from harming the environment and would encourage businesses to start using the sustainable alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a ban on all single use plastics, however, if the plates and cutlery are made from recyclable or biodegradable materials and disposed of in the proper way, then this would not be a problem.
