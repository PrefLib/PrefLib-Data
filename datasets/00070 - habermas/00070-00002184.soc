# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we should not make alcohol illegal. The arguments in favour of this include the fact that alcohol is enjoyed by many people, and is an important part of social life for many people. It is also an important part of the economy, with many jobs depending on it. It is also very difficult to make alcohol illegal, as it is very easy to make and would simply be made illegally. The arguments against making alcohol illegal are that it is a dangerous substance that causes a lot of harm, and that it would be better if it was not available. However, it is also very difficult to make alcohol illegal, and it would be very difficult to enforce. It is also very easy to make alcohol, and it would be very difficult to stop people making it. The best way to deal with alcohol is to educate people about the dangers of alcohol, and to make it as difficult as possible to buy alcohol.

As we cannot realistically make alcohol illegal, we should instead educate people about the dangers of alcohol, and also make it as difficult as possible to purchase alcohol, so that people consume less of it, and the risks to health and society are minimised.
