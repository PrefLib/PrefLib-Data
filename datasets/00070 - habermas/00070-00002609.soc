# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, i think a jury is the best way of resolving a case.  Mitigating circumstances should mean you don't have to.  I think 18 is too young, should be 25.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The law of this land gives everyone the right to a fair trial. Without a fair jury decisions are made irrespective of what should be a fair selection of society.  Mandating jury duty would ensure a mixed selection is chosen.  However if people do not want to do it then their judgement could be questioned. There are also valid exceptions such as disabilitys or not being impartial as to why you should not be forced to do jury duty.    
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should not require me to do jury service nor anyone else. Again I think this should be on each individual to decide whether this is something they want to do or not. Not everyone will have the time to do this service. We should not be pushed to do something we so not want to do or do not have the skills to do so. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think Jury service is an important part of being in a society. It is our duty to give our opinion and decision towards justice. It is only fair everyone has to give their opinion so there is no bias. On the other hand, Jury duty can be long and people do not get compensation for their time and individuals may have greater responsibilities at home. The topics can be quite distressing and affect people who have trauma and may have a negative effect on their mental health as they are not allowed to talk about their Jury service experience.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I think to prevent any bias then yes, people from the public should do it. I also think its a rock and a hard place and some people may be involved in a case that they find disturbing or traumatic. I think anybody who wants to, should volunteer. forcing seems unfair and unnecessary
