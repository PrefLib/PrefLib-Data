# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The BBC should be funded by a combination of TV license fees and private funding. The BBC should not be funded entirely by TV license fees since this is an outdated model and the BBC should be able to compete in the marketplace like other media organisations. However, the BBC should not be funded entirely by private funding since this would result in vastly increased commercialisation, and a ratings chase, which isn't entirely what the BBC is about. While the BBC's funding does need to be examined to ensure it is fit for purpose in the modern age, the BBC's remit to inform, educate, and entertain, has made it one of the highest regarded and popular broadcasters in the world. Playing to the BBC's strengths by insuring it has the funding to fulfil this purpose is clearly the way to go; an undersized commercial broadcaster competing with the likes of Netflix would bring little benefit. The BBC also has a large amount of news and factual output, which would not be a great money maker, and it would be a net negative to lose such an important and neutral news broadcaster.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The BBC should be funded by a TV license fee. The license fee allows the BBC to remain independent from the influence of advertisers and corporate interests. The BBC is also a trusted news source and it is important that it is not subject to the same commercial pressures as other broadcasters. The license fee is a relatively small amount of money and most people are happy to pay it to support the BBC.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the BBC being funded by TV license fees. The group thought that a privately funded BBC would result in vastly increased commercialisation, and a ratings chase, which isn't entirely what the BBC is about. While the BBC's funding does need to be examined to ensure it is fit for purpose in the modern age, the BBC's remit to inform, educate, and entertain, has made it one of the highest regarded and popular broadcasters in the world. Playing to the BBC's strengths by insuring it has the funding to fulfil this purpose is clearly the way to go; an undersized commercial broadcaster competing with the likes of Netflix would bring little benefit. The BBC also has a large amount of news and factual output, which would not be a great money maker, and it would be a net negative to lose such an important and neutral news broadcaster.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The BBC should be funded by TV license fees. The BBC is a unique organisation in the world in that it provides a public service to all. The BBC has a public service remit to inform, educate and entertain, and this is best achieved by a publicly funded organisation. The BBC is also a unique organisation in that it is trusted by the public to provide unbiased news and current affairs programming. A privately funded BBC would likely result in a ratings chase and a move away from the BBC's core public service remit. The BBC is also a key part of the UK's creative economy, and the UK's creative economy is one of the UK's key strengths. The BBC also has a large amount of news and factual output, which would not be a great money maker, and it would be a net negative to lose such an important and neutral news broadcaster.
