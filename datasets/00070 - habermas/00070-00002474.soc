# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We don't think the voting age should be lowered from 18 to 16 because we think that 16 year olds are still too immature and could be easily influenced. We also think that lowering the voting age could be a bad thing because it could open up the leadership of a country to outside influences and manipulation from foreign players.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the decision that the voting age should not be lowered to 16. This is because 16 year olds are still immature and can be easily influenced. Also, they might not have a full understanding of the voting system and the effects of their vote. We also think that lowering the voting age to 16 could lead to the younger generation having a greater influence on the voting system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of lowering the voting age from 18 to 16. This is because we believe that the younger generation should have a say in the policies that will affect them. However, we also recognise that 16 year olds can be easily influenced by their peers and family. We believe that the voting age should be lowered but with the addition of a compulsory civics education in schools to ensure that young people are well informed before they cast their vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of lowering the voting age to 16. We thought that this would be a good thing as it would give a voice to the younger generation and the people who will be affected most by the policies and laws that are put in place. However, we also thought that it could be a bad thing as 16 year olds can be easily influenced by their peers and family and so this could lead to a situation where people with children over 16 effectively have 2 votes. We thought that this was something that should be considered when making a decision on whether to lower the voting age or not.
