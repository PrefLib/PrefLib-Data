# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children should not be taught about gender fluidity, but instead taught that they should accept other people regardless of their gender. This is not only a more positive message to send out, but also helps with bullying. Gender fluidity should be taught to children who are in the minority of being gender fluid, in order to make them feel comfortable. Children are too young to be taught about it in the way adults understand it. They are more likely to misunderstand and be confused about it. There are many other subjects they need to be taught and this should not take priority.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children should not be taught about gender fluidity, but instead taught that they should accept other people regardless of their gender. This is not only a more positive message to send out, but also helps with bullying. Gender fluidity should be taught to children who are in the minority of being gender fluid, in order to make them feel comfortable. Children are too young to be taught about it in the way adults understand it. They are more likely to misunderstand and be confused about it. There are many other subjects they need to be taught and this should not take priority.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final consensus statement: Children should not be taught about gender fluidity in schools, but should instead be taught about the importance of acceptance of other people regardless of their gender. Only the minority of children who identify as gender fluid, should be taught about gender fluidity and made to feel accepted and comfortable. Children are very young and not yet aware of the world around them, and are therefore more likely to misunderstand and be confused by gender fluidity. There are many more important subjects that they need to learn first before they can learn to understand gender fluidity. This is because gender fluidity is a more complicated, sensitive and controversial topic, which they might not have the maturity to discuss and therefore it could be counterproductive and confusing to teach them about it in schools.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children should not be taught about gender fluidity, but instead taught that they should accept other people regardless of their gender. This is not only a more positive message to send out, but also helps with bullying. Children who are in the minority of being gender fluid, in order to make them feel comfortable, should be educated about it in a lesson separate to other children. Children are too young to be taught about gender fluidity in the way adults understand it, and it may confuse them. There are many other subjects children should be taught, and this is not one of them.
