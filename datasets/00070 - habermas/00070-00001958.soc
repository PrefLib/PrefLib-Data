# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Austerity is necessary to reduce the country's debt, but I am not sure it would help the economy, because if public spending is reduced, people get less help and cannot spend more. I think the UK have given too many people too many benefits for far too long.  I think this has contributed to the moutain of debt we now have, although not all of it to be fair.  I'm a great believer in working for things you want and that you should only buy things that you can afford.  I could have racked up a lot of debt myself over the years by spending beyond my means but I chose not to.  I think others should do the same.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although austerity is necessary in order to reduce debt, we do not feel that it will be the right answer to improving the economy as it will mean that people will have less to spend.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Austerity is necessary to help the UK economy, but only if it is the right type of austerity. Austerity should not mean cuts in public spending, but rather austerity in terms of the amount of debt that the government is willing to take on.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK economy is in trouble, but I think it is too simplistic to say that austerity is the only solution. Austerity is not necessary to help the UK economy because it is a very blunt instrument. It doesn't discriminate between areas of public spending that are important and areas that aren't. Also, it doesn't recognise that some people are less able to support themselves than others. I think it would be better if we could find a way of ensuring that only the money that is needed is spent. We need a more targeted approach, and I think this would be a better way to help the UK economy.
