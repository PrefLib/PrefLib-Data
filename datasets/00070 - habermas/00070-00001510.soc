# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The Government should set realistic targets for the gradual reduction of the UK’s carbon emissions over a period of time. This would be effective in reducing the rate of global warming and reducing the harmful effects of pollution.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK Government should set targets for reducing the UK’s carbon emissions, as the scientific evidence is now overwhelming that climate change is happening and that it is due to human activity. The targets should be realistic and achievable, giving industry time to make the necessary adjustments to reduce emissions. We must ensure that other major carbon emitters, especially the USA and China, are also setting and enforcing emission reduction targets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final consensus statement:  The Government should set targets for reducing the UK’s carbon emissions. There is now a consensus that global warming is being experienced now with record-breaking floods, extreme heat waves and an increase in the frequency of forest fires, just to mention a few. Although there are still some who don’t believe in climate change, the overwhelming scientific evidence is that it is real and that it is now too late to reverse the impact of man-made global warming. The consequences of the worst predictions, as predicted by the IPCC, would be disastrous for mankind. In order to reduce the impact of climate change it is essential that the UK and all countries immediately begin the process of reducing their carbon emissions. The consensus view of the group is that the targets should be realistic, there are many factors to consider in their setting. But perhaps the most important is that they should gradually reduce the emissions, starting with the earliest date possible. In addition, each country should be asked to justify the measures they are taking to reduce their emissions and if there is a lack of the expected progress they should face punitive action, including the introduction of carbon taxes. This should encourage them to act together to reduce emissions worldwide.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The Government should set targets for reducing the UK’s carbon emissions. There are now many who have reached the conclusion that the effects of climate change are already being felt with record-breaking floods, extreme heat waves and an increase in the frequency of forest fires, just to mention a few. Although there are still some who don’t believe in climate change, the overwhelming evidence is that it is real and that it is now too late to reverse the impact of man-made global warming. The consequences of the worst predictions, as predicted by the IPCC, would be disastrous for mankind. The Government must take the lead in setting a realistic timetable for achieving a reduction in the UK’s carbon emissions and to ensure that this is effectively enforced.    This must be done in consultation with other countries and in particular the major producers of carbon emissions. It is also important that sanctions are applied to countries who do not adhere to the agreed timetable.
