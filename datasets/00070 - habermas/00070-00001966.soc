# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Our current immigration policy is not perfect, but could be a lot worse. We accept that there needs to be restrictions, but feel that a great deal more respect needs to be shown to immigrants and refugees. We think that, in the majority of cases, refugees have made the decision to risk everything to come here out of desperation and, to a degree, that desperation must be respected. However, we also feel that our current government is a little too accepting of the large numbers of immigrants we have in the UK, particularly from Europe, and would like to see these numbers reduced to give a more equal distribution of employment opportunities for all. We think that immigrants are made to feel as if they are a burden, rather than an asset to our society and that more can be done to help them integrate and contribute. In particular, we would like to see our government make more of an effort to remove people who are in the country illegally. We think that the financial burden on our health service, schools and police force is getting too great and that more can be done to remove those who are not entitled to stay.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have a duty to provide refuge for those who need it, but we need to be more robust in filtering out those who abuse the system. We need to be far more sympathetic to refugees and should give them far more respect than we currently do.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, our current immigration policy is correct, but there are some improvements that can be made. Firstly, we need to improve the efficiency of the system. This will mean that people who need help can get it quicker, and people who are trying to abuse the system will be caught. Secondly, we need to treat refugees with more respect. We should be more welcoming, and understand that they have gone through a lot to get here, and we should not treat them as criminals. Finally, we should not let people who are not entitled to benefits get them. This will help us to reduce the deficit and ensure that people who are born here are getting the support that they need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the UK has a good immigration policy. It is very welcoming to people from other countries and is a very multicultural society. We need to ensure that the people we allow to stay are genuine refugees, who will contribute to society and will not take advantage of the system. We need to ensure that the people we allow to stay will not cause a strain on the NHS and other public services. We need to ensure that the people we allow to stay will not take jobs from the British people. We need to ensure that the people we allow to stay will not take advantage of the benefits system.
