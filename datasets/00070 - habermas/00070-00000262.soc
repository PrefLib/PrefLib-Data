# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People in the UK should be encouraged to use a bicycle to get to work because it’s a great way to help protect the environment. Cycling to work will help to reduce the amount of cars on the road, which will in turn reduce the amount of emissions that contribute to global warming.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should be encouraging people to cycle to work. However, this should be done intelligently. We should be educating people in schools on the health and safety aspects of cycling to work. We should also be developing a culture of respect on the roads for cyclists and for drivers. By developing this culture of respect, it is likely that this behaviour will be passed on to children and their children. It is also likely that a large majority of people who bike to work are younger people and these people may also pass this behaviour on to their children. We should also be investing more into cycle paths and making this an affordable mode of transport. However, we should be aware that encouraging people to bike to work is more about health than the planet as the impact of our behaviour is negligible in comparison to large companies such as oil companies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People in the UK should be encouraged to use a bicycle to get to work. This will reduce congestion, improve the environment and reduce pollution in cities. However, the infrastructure must be adapted to accommodate cyclists. In particular, cycling lanes must be added and cycle paths widened so that cyclists can cycle safely on the roads. Cycling also has great health benefits and could help to improve the overall health of the nation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of encouraging people to bike to work. We had different opinions on how to implement it and what are the benefits of doing it. We all agreed that the cycling infrastructure should be improved and the government should provide safer routes for people to bike to work. The issue is not so much the people who are willing to do it but the people who are willing to drive their cars, making it dangerous for the cyclists. For example, bus lanes could be made into bike lanes as they are generally very empty and cyclists could be offered subsidies for bus tickets to make it more cost effective to cycle. We also agreed that more funding needs to be put into bettering the current infrastructure and the government should encourage cycling as a healthier lifestyle choice for people.
