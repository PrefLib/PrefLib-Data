# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A universal basic income would not be a good idea in the UK at the moment. There are too many things that would need to be worked out to ensure it is a success, and the current economy would not support it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In principle, the concept of a universal basic income is a good idea. The current benefit system is very complex and difficult to navigate. A universal basic income would simplify the system and be fairer for everyone. However, the idea of a universal basic income is currently impractical and would require a large amount of money to implement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be a universal basic income, as it will increase the quality of life of all people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In principle, we support the idea of a universal basic income. However, we believe that a universal basic income should be trialled on a smaller scale before it is rolled out across the whole of the UK.
