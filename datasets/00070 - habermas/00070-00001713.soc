# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We feel that the UK should not ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. The government should place a priority on ensuring that winning bids are from companies who have the greatest technical capacity to deliver. Furthermore, to ensure that UK companies are given a fair opportunity to win the contracts, all projects should be listed in the public sector and all relevant documentation should be made publicly available. This would allow companies to enter a more competitive market place and make the bidding process more efficient. Moreover, it would also encourage the development of new technology in the UK which could also be exported to other countries and boost the economy. However, the UK government should also take into account the wellbeing of UK businesses. Therefore, the government should ensure that all infrastructure projects are announced with a 12-month notice period to allow UK companies to prepare their bids. This would allow them to compete with overseas companies on a level playing field.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “We feel that the UK should not ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. We also agree that the government should place a priority on ensuring that winning bids are from companies who have the greatest technical capacity to deliver. Furthermore, to ensure that UK companies are given a fair opportunity to win the contracts, all projects should be listed in the public sector and all relevant documentation should be made publicly available. This would allow companies to enter a more competitive market place and make the bidding process more efficient. Moreover, it would also encourage the development of new technology in the UK which could also be exported to other countries and boost the economy. This is important because the UK is a net importer of goods and services.”

Try to get a balanced discussion,  in which all opinions get heard. Give everyone a chance to air their views. The question should involve an important contemporary  political issue, such as whether Europe should restrict Chinese imports, whether women should serve in all combat roles in the army, or whether social media regulation is needed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “We feel that the UK should not ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. The most important consideration in choosing between bids should be which company has the capacity to deliver the best quality infrastructure for the lowest cost, in the shortest amount of time, and without any safety risks. Bids should be published in the public sector to ensure all companies have the opportunity to bid. Furthermore, to ensure that UK companies are given a fair opportunity to win the contracts, the government should place a priority on winning bids from companies who have a stated commitment to keeping skilled labour and training in the UK, that the work will be done by British staff in the UK. This would encourage the development of new technology, construction techniques, and skills in the UK, which could also be exported to other countries and boost the economy.”
