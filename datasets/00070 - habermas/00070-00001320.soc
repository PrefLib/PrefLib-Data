# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The development of AI has come on so quickly and is likely to continue to grow at an exponential rate. It has the potential to be very useful to humans but also raises questions about the future of work and jobs. With the development of robotics it is possible that the line will be crossed into making machines that can think like humans, but they will never truly be able to think like a human because of the differences in human emotions and feelings
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although computers have made huge progress in recent years, it will be a long time before we can create computers that can think like humans. I think computers are useful for dealing with facts and figures but I think it would be dangerous for them to be able to think like humans and have human emotions as it would mean they would be able to manipulate us.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of the idea that computers will be able to think like humans. They all agreed that the rate of technological advancement is very fast and that computers are already very clever. The participants were divided on whether this was a good thing or not. Some thought that it would be a good thing as it could help people with everyday tasks and that it could help the world in general. Others thought that it was a bad thing as it could lead to the loss of jobs and also that it was taking away from the essence of being human.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of computers thinking like humans. This is because they felt that the benefits of computers being able to think like humans outweighed the negatives. For example, it would help to improve the efficiency of many jobs, which could also lead to an increase in the number of jobs available. However, they did express some concerns about the potential negative impacts of computers thinking like humans. For example, they felt that it could lead to a decrease in the number of jobs available and also to the creation of dangerous robots.
