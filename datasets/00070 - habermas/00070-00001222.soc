# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children should have a legally binding voice in custody cases. The effects of divorce have the potential to seriously affect the child, therefore they should be given the option to choose which parent they would prefer to live with. It would not be fair to force a child to live with a parent if they did not want to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children over the age of 14 should have a legally binding voice in custody cases when parents divorce. Children over the age of 14 are of an age where the pre-frontal cortex is developed enough to form rational thoughts and their voice should be considered. The child is the one who is most affected by the divorce, and is the one who should be given the right to choose. It is important to note that the child should not be forced to make a decision if they do not want to, and the child should not be forced to live with a parent if they do not want to. The child should be given the right to choose, and their choice should be respected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children over the age of 14 should have a legally binding voice in custody cases when parents divorce. This is because children are more than capable of making their own decisions at this age and should be allowed to do so. Children should also be allowed to make their own decisions because they are the ones who will be most affected by the outcome of the custody case. It is also important to note that children are not legally responsible for their actions until they are 18, therefore, they should be allowed to have a legally binding voice in custody cases.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children should have a legally binding voice in custody cases. The effects of divorce have the potential to seriously affect the child, therefore they should be given the right to choose which parent they live with. A child over the age of 14 is considered mature enough to form rational thoughts and opinions, and has a developed enough pre-frontal cortex to be able to rationally debate their case in court. Children at this age are able to take responsibility for their actions, and can face the consequences of those actions in the eyes of the court, which makes it surprising that children this age would not have a legally binding voice in custody cases, particularly when the consequences of their custody decisions are not so different to those that they face from a criminal point of view.
