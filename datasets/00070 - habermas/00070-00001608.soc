# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK's health service is the NHS providing world-leading healthcare. The NHS is accessible to all and is free at the point of use. It provides a good standard of healthcare in comparison to other countries, however, this is not necessarily world-leading. The NHS does provide some world-leading treatments, however, the cost of some treatments is too high for them to be approved for NHS use. The NHS does provide a world-leading model for healthcare, in the sense that it provides equal access to all. However, this model is not necessarily world-leading in terms of the actual standard of healthcare.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The NHS is a world-leading healthcare system in terms of accessibility, but not in terms of the actual healthcare provided.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK’s health service is providing world-leading healthcare, in the sense that it is accessible and free to all, which is not the case in many countries. However, in terms of the actual standard of healthcare, the NHS provides a good standard in comparison to third world countries and of equal comparison to western countries. However, we don't believe that it is world-leading in the sense that it is more advanced than other global healthcare.
