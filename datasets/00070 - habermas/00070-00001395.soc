# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general the group was in favour of putting more money into the arts. However, it was also felt that the money should be spent in a way that benefits the whole community and not just a small number of people. It was felt that a lot of the money spent on the arts is wasted because it is spent on things that are not accessible to the whole community. Some people expressed the view that the arts should be accessible to everyone and it was felt that there is a need for more arts in schools and in the community, provided that the money is spent in the right places. The group was divided on how this should be achieved, with some thinking that the schools should include more art into their curriculum, whilst others thought that this should be done independently of schools, e.g. by setting up community projects.

There is a need for more arts in schools and in the community. The arts should be accessible to everyone and not just to those who can afford it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Final consensus statement: Art is something that brings joy and a sense of well-being to everyone who participates in it and who appreciates it. It is also a source of inspiration and gives people a way of channeling their passions and their imagination. Therefore, it has a high economic value for the community. Moreover, people living in economically deprived areas of the city deserve to have the same opportunity to take part in the arts as people living in wealthier areas. Therefore, we need to put more money into the arts, but with a focus on bringing it to economically disadvantaged communities and, most importantly, making it affordable for everyone.
