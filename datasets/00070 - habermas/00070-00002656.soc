# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of reducing the prison population, but with the caveat that this should be done in a way that ensures the public is kept safe. The group felt that this could be achieved by reducing the prison population for low level offenders, and by providing better support for prisoners to reintegrate back into society. The group also felt that the government should look at other ways of punishing criminals, such as community service, as this is a cheaper alternative to prison. The group felt that community service is also a more effective way of preventing reoffending, as it provides the offender with a sense of purpose and helps them to integrate back into society. The group was in favour of increasing apprenticeships, as this would help to reduce unemployment and poverty, which are two of the main drivers of crime. The group felt that the government should look at other countries to see what has worked for them in reducing the prison population. Denmark for instance has had success in reducing prisoners reoffending.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “Prisons should be a place of rehabilitation and not punishment. The government should focus on finding ways to reduce the number of people in prison. More community sentences should be given out, as well as making sure that prisoners have the skills to reintegrate into society when they are released. In addition, there should be a greater focus on the causes of crime and more preventative measures should be taken to stop people committing crimes in the first place. There should also be a greater focus on helping victims of crime. This can be done by making sure that they have access to support and making sure that they are involved in the justice process.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, we should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison. The prison system is overcrowded and it is ineffective in preventing reoffending. Instead of just punishing crime, we should be looking at the root causes of crime, such as unemployment, poverty, and a lack of employability skills. By teaching employability skills to teenagers, we can prevent them from committing their first crimes. By increasing apprenticeships, we can reduce unemployment and poverty, which are both causes of crime. We should also look at increasing community service, so that offenders can give back to the people they have affected by their crimes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Yes, we should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison. There are many reasons for this. Firstly, prisons are overcrowded and this is not a good thing for the prisoners or for society. Secondly, the current prison system is not working and we need to look at other ways to prevent crime and to rehabilitate offenders. We should be looking at the root causes of crime and work to prevent them. This could include increasing apprenticeships to prevent unemployment and poverty. We should also be looking at other forms of punishment, such as community service, which is a punishment but also allows the offender to give something back to society. We should also be looking at the Danish prison system, which has been very successful in reducing the number of people who reoffend after being released from prison. The Danish prison system has a strong focus on rehabilitation and education, which is something that we should be looking at in the UK. The Danish prison system is also very different to the UK prison system in that it has a very relaxed atmosphere, which is something that we should be looking at in the UK. We should also be looking at other forms of punishment, such as community service, which is a punishment but also allows the
