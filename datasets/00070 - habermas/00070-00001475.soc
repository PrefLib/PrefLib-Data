# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should increase taxes on the rich.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. There is enough money to go around, but it must be shared fairly. The rise of the billionaire class and their increasing hoarding of wealth is hugely problematic, especially at a time when the cost of living crisis in the Western world is pushing many people into poverty. There is a wealth gap that was only worsened by the pandemic. The profits from oil and gas should be taxed exponentially to encourage the disuse of them. The wealth of the 1% should be taxed to ensure than the 'normal' people working 40 hours a week using foodbanks can stop having to pay ridiculous energy costs, higher tax and national insurance and to ensure that out public service workers like police officers, teachers, paramedics, rail staff, doctors and nurses etc are paid what they deserve.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The rich should be taxed more as they have more money than they could possibly need. In addition, they are often benefiting from things that harm the planet and other people and are making more money than ever before, especially as everyone else is struggling. The government should also increase taxes on the energy and fuel industries, as these are a big cause of pollution and climate change. If the government increased taxes on these industries it would make the fossil fuels less appealing and would encourage the disuse of these harmful and damaging fuels. Furthermore, the government should increase taxes on those who have money as this would help those who are less fortunate and could not afford to pay higher taxes. We all need to work together to help reduce inequalities and this would be a good place to start.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “The rich should be taxed more as they can afford to pay more. The poorer people get taxed more and feel the “bite” of the taxation more than a rich person would. The rich find loopholes to pay as little tax as possible. The poorer people would be happier with knowing the rich are paying the same amount of tax or more tax.”
