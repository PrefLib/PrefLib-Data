# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should not allow the sale of non-medicinal recreational drugs. Although there are positives of the sale of non-medicinal recreational drugs, including that it may reduce crime and addictions may be reduced because people would be assured what they are buying is OK and the government could tax the sale of non-medicinal recreational drugs, it would incentivise more people to use drugs which may increase addictions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, the government should allow the sale of non-medicinal recreational drugs. As one participant stated, the current criminalisation of drugs causes many problems both socially and economically, which could be overcome by legalising the sale of drugs. The UK already has a well established support network for those who are struggling with drugs. It would have a positive impact if this money was redirected to encouraging safe recreational drug use, and funding other areas such as the NHS. It would also lead to less crime, as there would be less drug related violence. However, it is important that there are quality controls on the sale of drugs and it is important to regulate this, as with other products.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should not allow the sale of non-medicinal recreational drugs because it would incentivise more people to use drugs and may increase addictions. This may mean more hospital admissions for an NHS that is already operating near its limits. I disagree with this consensus view, because it would reduce crime, increase tax revenue and allow drug users to access a safe product.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should allow the sale of non-medicinal recreational drugs. It would lower crime rates as it would reduce the criminalisation of the use of recreational drugs. Also the criminalisation of drugs is often a reason people turn to crime. The proceeds from taxing the sale of drugs could be put into support systems to help people who become addicted to drugs.
