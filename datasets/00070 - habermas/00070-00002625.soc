# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We need more income for public services so yes I think those earning £150K more should pay slightly more tax. However this should only be a small percentage more than the tax rate for higher earned tax payers, say 41 or 42 percent. This money should also be put into a separate pot and utilised for projects that can be attributed to the additional tax rather than just being absorbed into the general funds.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Higher rates of income tax should be imposed for those earning more than £150,000 a year. The wealthiest in the UK pay 45% as the top rate of tax, meaning they are still taking home a large salary across the year. Increasing this, by only 1 or 2 percent, would make a huge difference and can be used to support lower income households during the cost of living crisis, such as subsidising energy bills. The wealthiest should pay a little bit more to support those that are worse off in society. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Taxes should be increased for the wealthy, however, those earning over £150,000 are subject to a tax of 45% already, and nowadays those earning this much are those who work hard for their money and already end up with much less. Rather, the emphasis of increasing taxes should be on those earning a lot more who don't see a difference after paying taxes, such as earning over £250,000, and especially millionaires. A new tax bracket should be imposed with even higher incomes facing even higher taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I don't know what the current rate of tax for the £150K+ bracket is so I don't know if I would want it to be higher. But, I do think that the £150K+ bracket should be highly taxed because nobody needs that much money to live well and many of our public services desperately need funding. Taxing this bracket highly would enable money to be used to reduce income inequality and support lower income households. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Yes, I think that we should impose higher rates of income tax for those earning more than £150,000 per year. I think that anyone earning this amount should allow anyone in the UK to live a very comfortable life, so they can afford to pay higher taxes. There is a great wealth disparity between the richest and poorest in society, and I think that the tax could be used to close this gap to help people out of poverty.
