# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Austerity is necessary to help the UK economy, but only if it is the right type of austerity. Austerity should not mean cuts in public spending, but rather austerity in terms of the amount of debt that the government is willing to take on. Austerity should not mean that the quality of public services will be reduced, as this will only lead to people needing the services more. The money saved by reducing the amount of debt the government takes on can then be used to invest in the economy and stimulate growth.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Austerity is necessary to help the UK economy, but only if it is the right type of austerity. Austerity should not mean cuts in public spending, but rather austerity in terms of the amount of debt that the government is willing to take on. By reducing the amount of debt that the government is willing to take on, interest payments will be reduced, meaning more money will be available for investment in the economy and to pay off the existing debt.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Austerity in terms of the amount of debt the government is willing to take on is necessary to help the UK economy, but only if it is the right type of austerity. Unfortunately for the UK economy, the government is facing both the wrong type of austerity and the wrong type of deficit reduction. The wrong type of austerity occurs when government spending is cut, for example by cutting benefits that people rely on and cutting the services that public sector workers provide, like education, health care and policing. The wrong type of deficit reduction is one that reduces the deficit by reducing spending (rather than by raising taxes). As more funding cuts will be made to public services and benefits, and since tax rates are unlikely to be increased, the UK is currently facing the wrong type of both austerity and deficit reduction.
