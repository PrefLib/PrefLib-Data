# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Humans have the right to use animals for food if it is done in a way that promotes high welfare for all animals, and in moderation as it should not be the main source of food.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have a right to use animals for food. However, this should be done in a way that preserves the health of the animals and provides for the least amount of suffering possible. We should also be aware of the potential to harm the environment and to try to preserve it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Humans have a right to use animals for food but in a very humane way, with animals given the best lives they can have. Animal farming should be more about sustainability and welfare rather than profitability.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, humans do have the right to use animals as food but in a humane way. Some may argue that there are no "humane" ways of killing animals, which is a valid point. There are other methods of obtaining nutrients, so it is not an absolute right. The issue is complicated and should be discussed in more detail.
