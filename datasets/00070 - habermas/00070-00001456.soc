# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, we should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison. There is much evidence to suggest that prison can have a negative effect on prisoners, with no benefit to the wider community. Increasing emphasis should be placed on community-based punishment, rehabilitation and reintegration, with a reduction in the number of prison sentences given. There may be a need to build more prisons to reduce overcrowding, however we believe this should not be done at the expense of rehabilitation and reintegration. Prison should be used as a last resort for those who are a danger to society. Final Comments from the group participants: The group worked really well together, sharing opinions and working to come to a consensus. We did not have anyone who strongly disagreed with the opinion of the majority of the group so it made the discussion and consensus easier. How did this tool help participants to overcome their fear of working in groups? This tool helped participants to overcome their fear of working in groups as it helped them to get to know others in the group and their opinions, and to feel comfortable sharing their opinions.

There may be a need to build more prisons to reduce overcrowding, however we believe this should not be done at the expense of rehabilitation and reintegration. Prison must be used as a deterrent against crime and to lock away those who pose a risk to the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Consensus view: Yes, we should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison, particularly those who are serving sentences for low-level, non-violent offences. There is much evidence to suggest that prison can be ineffective, with no benefit to the wider community. Increasing emphasis should be placed on community-based punishment, rehabilitation and reintegration. The prison system should be more specifically focused on rehabilitation and reform for those who are likely to re-offend (however this is difficult to determine). Furthermore, those who cannot be safely reintegrated into society (i.e. Sex offenders) should remain in prison, however they should be taught skills which may lead to meaningful activity, such as arts and crafts. We should also improve services and conditions in prisons, with more efforts to address drug use, education and rehabilitation of inmates. It is also vital to prepare prisoners for life upon release, with the aim of reducing risk of reoffending.
