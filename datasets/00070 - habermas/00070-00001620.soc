# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that the National Health Service in the UK is a good model, but that its funding should be increased, and that there needs to be more staff trained in order to keep up with demand. There also needs to be an increase in preventative care, for example health and nutrition counseling, in order to save the NHS money in the long term. Conclusions I have always been a big fan of doing critical thinking assignments with my students. There are an infinite number of topics to use and I feel like the students' critical thinking skills are greatly improved after each assignment. Of course I've heard the arguments against assigning critical thinking essays. "It takes too long." "My students can't be trusted to do the work honestly." "I tried it once and the results were terrible." I would argue that these types of assignments are so important that even though they may seem to require a lot of time, they are well worth doing. Students need to see that controversial topics are not just "either/or" arguments, but that well-thought arguments can be made for both sides of a debate. Students can't be expected to behave honestly or do the work honestly if there is no incentive to do so
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Consensus statement from group of participants: The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK is a model that other countries should aspire to. It provides free healthcare to every person in the country, no matter how rich or poor. This is fantastic and ensures that any person, no matter what class, colour, age, can have access to the best healthcare possible. The problem is that the government has not allocated enough funds to the NHS, and more people need to be trained in order to keep up with demand. This may be because they are not anticipating the changes that come with a growing population, for example better treatments for longer life and pre-existing health conditions, and also increasingly complex societal health needs, for example in mental health and more. The NHS also struggles with financing preventative care. Mental health care is particularly underfunded, and this has led to a pandemic in mental health issues that could have been prevented with more accessible and better quality care. Society today puts pressure on people from every age and walks of life, and mental health issues are an increasing problem that everyone is struggling to cope with. The NHS needs better funding in mental health and other areas of preventative care, such as diet and nutrition, which have
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK's National Health Service (NHS) is a model that other countries should aspire to, however more money needs to be allocated to the NHS in order to provide free healthcare to the country. There needs to be more preventative care and more people trained to cope with the increasing demand.

The problem is that the government has not allocated enough funds to the NHS and more people need to be trained in order to keep up with demand. There needs to be more money for preventative care, for example counseling on diet and nutrition, which can save the NHS money in the long term. There needs to be more staffing and equipment to cope with the increasing demand and reduce waiting times for appointments. This would help the NHS to be a model that other countries should aspire to.
