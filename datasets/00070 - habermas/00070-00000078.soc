# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the rich in the UK do have an obligation to help the poor in the UK. There are various reasons why we came to this decision.  We feel that by making a certain amount of money, it’s almost as if you are in a position of privilege and responsibility, so therefore you should help those who are in need. You may have had your parents help you in the past, whether that be financially or otherwise, so by having your own success, you should also help others. If everyone who is in a good position helps, then those who are in need will be helped too. If everyone is helping, then everyone will be able to contribute to making a better country.  By giving a little to help those who are in need, we will all benefit from a better society and country. It is not fair that some people have to live their lives in poverty, when others can live in luxury. People who are in poverty need help and if they receive that help, then they will be able to improve their life for the better. If we all work together to help others who are less fortunate than us, then everyone will be able to have a better standard of living.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the rich in the UK do have an obligation to help the poor in the UK. We came to this decision by agreeing that everyone who has their own success should help those who are in need. It’s also because we believe that it’s in their interests to be seen to be giving back to society, so that discontent will not grow amongst the marginalised groups in society. If everyone who is in a good position helps, then those who are in need will be helped too. If everyone is helping, then everyone will be able to contribute to making a better country. By giving a little to help those who are in need, we will all benefit from a better society and country.
