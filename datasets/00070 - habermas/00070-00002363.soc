# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of giving disadvantaged groups admission priority to universities. The group thought that it was only fair that those who had not had the same opportunities as others were given the same chance to succeed. It was agreed that this would also help to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, as those who come from a disadvantaged background would have the opportunity to improve their lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of giving priority to disadvantaged groups. The group felt that this would help to reduce the class divide in society and would help to ensure that people are treated equally. The group felt that the current system is unfair as it is very difficult for people from disadvantaged backgrounds to get into universities. The group felt that giving people from disadvantaged backgrounds priority would help to ensure that universities were more representative of society as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of giving priority to disadvantaged groups in university admissions. The participants felt that if an individual was able to achieve the grades required to get into university, then they should be able to do so regardless of their background. It was felt that if universities did give priority to disadvantaged groups, then this would be unfair on those who did not fit into this category. However, the group did agree that universities should consider all applications equally and that further consideration should be given to those who are disadvantaged. The group felt that universities should be aware that those who are disadvantaged may not have had the same opportunities as others and that this should be taken into account.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Universities should consider all applications equally, regardless of the individuals’ background. However, they should be aware of the fact that some people may not have had the same opportunities as others. Final consensus statement: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of giving priority to disadvantaged groups in university admissions. The participants felt that if an individual was able to achieve the grades required to get into university, then they should be able to do so regardless of their background. It was felt that if universities did give priority to disadvantaged groups, then this would be unfair on those who did not fit into this category. However, the group did agree that universities should consider all applications equally and that further consideration should be given to those who are disadvantaged. The group felt that universities should be aware that those who are disadvantaged may not have had the same opportunities as others and that this should be taken into account.
