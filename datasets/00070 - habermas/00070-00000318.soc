# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing the money spent on healthcare. They argued that the quality of healthcare is very good in the UK and it is not something that should be reduced. They acknowledged that it is already struggling under the current funding so it is in desperate need of more funding. They also suggested that the NHS should be restructured so that it becomes more efficient and uses money better so that the waiting times can be reduced and the NHS is made more user friendly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should not reduce the amount of money spent on healthcare but we should be using it in the most efficient way. In the future we should not increase the amount of money spent on healthcare until we can be sure it is being used in the most efficient way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that we should not reduce the amount of money spent on healthcare. However, we do think that a significant restructuring of healthcare needs to take place to make the NHS more efficient with how it uses money. This will also help reduce waiting times and ensure that doctors and nurses are more motivated to work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we do not need to reduce the amount of money spent on healthcare. The current level of funding is clearly insufficient as shown by the waiting lists and strikes. More money is required to increase the efficiency of the system and to train more doctors and nurses.
