# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of raising taxes on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service. The group was of the opinion that the NHS is in dire need of more funding and that the government clearly does not have this money. The group was of the opinion that the wealthy should contribute more in taxes towards public services than the average person. The group was of the opinion that people earning more than $200,000 are in the top 10% of earners in the country and can therefore afford to contribute more. The group was of the opinion that people earning less than $200,000 are already struggling and inflation is taxing away their value. The group was of the opinion that the NHS is a vital service and needs to be funded. The group was of the opinion that the government should be smarter with spending to not require constant raising of taxes, but if a raise is to be made it should be covered more by higher earners.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, the UK should raise taxes on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK should raise taxes on people earning more than $200000 to help pay for the NHS. With the rising cost of health care and more people accessing healthcare, it is only right to raise taxes for those who can afford to pay. The UK has a fairly flat tax system, therefore it is not really fair for those earning under $200000 to continue to pay the same tax as someone earning a lot more than they are. The UK should ensure that the taxes they collect from these high earners are spent wisely. The additional funds raised should be used to improve the services offered by the NHS, reduce waiting times, improve access to care and increase the quality of care for patients.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should raise taxes on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the NHS. The NHS is in dire need of funding and so taxes need to be raised on those who can afford to contribute more. It is also only fair that the wealthy contribute more in taxes towards public services than the average person.
