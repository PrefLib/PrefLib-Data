# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While it is very important that social media is regulated, the government is not best placed to do so. The government have proven that they are not capable of being unbiased and cannot be trusted to work in the best interests of the public. The group decided that it is impossible for the government to remain unbiased, as there is always going to be a bias based on the members of the government, and it is always going to be impossible to control. The government may be capable of regulating social media, but they are not capable of regulating it to the benefit of all members of the public. The group decided that in order to regulate social media correctly, there must be a group of independent and unbiased individuals who have no ties to the government or any large social media corporations. They must have the best interests of the public in mind and not what would be best for their party, their interests, their family or anything else.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, the government is not best placed to regulate social media. This is because the government is not neutral, and is likely to use regulation to silence criticism of itself. The government is also not representative of the population, and is therefore not best placed to make decisions on behalf of the population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, the government is not best placed to regulate social media. The government is supposed to be an elected group of individuals that rightly and with correct morality guide, support and lead their population, with the populations best interests in mind. This is clearly not what the government is. It is instead a heavily biased, unwaveringly negating group of people who have no issue with bending the truth or outright lying. We therefore cannot trust the government to have a factual and rightly neutral, unbiased decision basis for social media regulation. This is the case no matter the issue or standpoint, as they would not hesitate to make decisions that are wrong by both supporter and opposer of the population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government is not best placed to regulate social media. They are too self serving to allow for neutral, factual, unbiased regulation and as such will take any opportunity they have to get rid of anything they see as a threat to their position of power.
