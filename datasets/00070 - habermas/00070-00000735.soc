# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Yes, more should be done to reduce greenhouse gases. This is one of the most pressing issues that we face as a civilization and could kill all of us. We need to speed things up and work much harder towards a solution.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that the targets we have set for ourselves in relation to greenhouse gases are not ambitious enough and that we should be doing more to reduce them. We should be working much harder to achieve these targets and be more ambitious in our approach.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the current targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases are reasonable. However, it is important to make every effort to reduce emissions as much as possible, as the issue is of great importance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should be more ambitious in meeting our targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases.
