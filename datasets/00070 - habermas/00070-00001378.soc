# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Most school exams are not too easy, but they could be more challenging. This is to allow students to fulfil their full potential, and also to help distinguish between students.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group felt that school exams vary greatly in difficulty. We agreed that most exams are suitable for the majority of students who work hard and have reasonable aspirations. However, we did agree that there is a worrying trend of dumbing down exams, especially in England, in an attempt to ensure students are not demoralised by failure. We felt that there are far too many top grades and this devalues them. In general, we felt that exams should be of a sufficiently high level to provide a challenge to even the most capable students.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Most school exams are adequately challenging. The level of challenge in exams is very dependent on the subject and grade level. Some exams may be too easy for the more advanced students, and other exams may be too difficult for students who are struggling. It is difficult to make a blanket statement that categorizes most school exams as universally too easy or too difficult. However, It is worth noting that opinions on the difficult of exams can vary from students, teachers, and educational experts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Most school exams are not too easy but they could be a lot more challenging. There are some people that would feel that they are not overly challenging, and some people that would feel that they are overly challenging. Some exam grades could be changed to show a wider gap between different grades. There is a big gap between the highest grades, but not as much of a gap between the lower grades.
