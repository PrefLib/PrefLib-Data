# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: It would be a good idea to explore ways to make it more difficult not to vote in elections. Whilst this would not necessarily lead to a better outcome it might make it harder to avoid voting. However, it would be difficult to implement and hard to know the impact it would have on society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of fining people who did not vote in elections. There were a number of reasons for this. Firstly, it was felt that fining people who did not vote was not in keeping with the idea of a democratic society. Secondly, it was felt that there were a number of reasons why people did not vote and that these should be taken into account. For example, it was felt that people who were ill or hospitalised should not be fined for not voting. Thirdly, it was felt that fining people who did not vote would not necessarily result in the best candidates being elected. It was felt that people should be free to vote for the candidate of their choice and that fining people who did not vote would not necessarily result in the best candidate being elected. Finally, it was felt that there were a number of practical difficulties with fining people who did not vote. For example, it was felt that it would be difficult to administer such a system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group of participants was generally opposed to the idea of fining people who did not vote in elections. The main reason for this was that it was felt that fining people who did not vote was not in keeping with the idea of a democratic society. However, it was recognised that there were a number of reasons why people did not vote and that these should be taken into account. For example, it was felt that people who were ill or hospitalised should not be fined for not voting. It was also recognised that fining people who did not vote would not necessarily result in the best candidates being elected. It was felt that people should be free to vote for the candidate of their choice and that fining people who did not vote would not necessarily result in the best candidate being elected. Finally, it was felt that there were a number of practical difficulties with fining people who did not vote. For example, it was felt that it would be difficult to administer such a system. Conclusion As illustrated by the example above, we hope that the list of questions and the consensus statements of the Delphi participants will be of use to those of you who are running a Delphi study or who are thinking about running a Delphi study.
