# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the UK should ban products that have been tested on animals. The benefits of testing on animals are not worth the suffering that the animals go through. There are alternatives such as computer modelling which could be used instead. The UK is a developed country and should not support such a cruel practice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although we have different opinions, we all agree that animal testing is not the best option. We would prefer that the UK ban products that have been tested on animals. However, we also understand that this is not the best option for humanity and so we have come to a compromise. We believe that the UK should ban products that have been tested on animals, but that they should allow some animal testing to continue, but in the most humane way possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the UK should ban products that have been tested on animals. However, there are some products that are essential to human health and wellbeing that could not be tested on humans. For these products, we believe that the benefits to humans outweigh the suffering of animals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that the UK should ban products that have been tested on animals because the suffering that the animals go through is not worth the benefits that humans gain from it. We also think that the animals have no choice in the matter and it is unfair to force them to go through this. We also believe that it is not necessary to test on animals as there are many alternatives to animal testing.
