# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not end the sale of all new internal combustion engines, but we should be working towards ending their sale.  We need to find an alternative that will meet the demand we currently have.  An alternative is costly and beyond the means of a lot of people.  We need to find a way to protect the environment and force innovation and improvement.  The best compromise would be subsidised electric engines and smaller more efficient combustion engines.  Larger engines such as tractors, heavy machinery and large vehicles, still have a big purpose in our society and we rely upon them alot.  Ending the sale of these engines without providing an adequate replacement will just be swapping one problem for another.  This change should be gradual and slow.  We need sound, systematic process that is slow, gradual and thorough.  There should be an end date to manufacturing new internal combustion engines, but it doesn't have to be soon, maybe in 20 years.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should not end the sale of all new internal combustion engines as there are some engines that are necessary. Any change should be gradual, giving people time to research and develop alternative solutions as well as allowing smaller businesses time to adjust. An end point for manufacturing engines should be set so that companies know the end goal and have the incentive to find a solution. Larger engines such as tractors, heavy machinery and large vehicles, still have a big purpose in our society and we rely upon them alot. Ending the sale of these engines without providing an adequate replacement will just be swapping one problem for another.  There needs to be a large increase in subsidies for alternatives to help encourage the change. There should be more research and focus on charging and battery technology, as these along with cost are the main issues that are hindering the uptake of electric engines. Research around hydrogen as a fuel for engines would also be beneficial.

Ending the sale of these engines without providing an adequate replacement will just be swapping one problem for another.  We should set a final date in the future to ban the sale of all new combustion engines, but not for a few decades.  This will allow us to research an alternative and give us time to deal with the social and economic issues.  I think this is a compromise that will allow the environment to recover but still keep the world ticking over.
