# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not require all public transport to be free. If it was not paid for by customers, the government would have to fund it using tax payer money. This would lead to increased taxes or lower spending in other more important areas. Whilst it would be beneficial to allow people to move around freely, we don't see how it would be practical. We should make it free for those who are vulnerable such as those with disabilities and chronic illnesses. Also, without income from fares the quality of the service might be compromised. However, we would all agree that making public transport free would greatly incentive people to use more the public transport and rely less on their own cars. This will lead to less congestion and should also reduce the carbon emissions. In order for this to be viable, the public network transport network should be extended.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should not require all public transport to be free. If it was not paid for by customers, the government would have to fund it using tax payer money. This would lead to increased taxes or lower spending in other more important areas. Whilst it would be beneficial to allow people to move around freely, it is important to bear in mind that it would also have significant downsides, for example for the quality of the service or for the budget if it were not funded through ticket sales. We should make it free for those who are vulnerable such as those with disabilities and chronic illnesses. Also, without income from fares the quality of the service might be compromised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should not require all public transport to be free. If it was not paid for by customers, the government would have to fund it using tax payer money. This would lead to increased taxes or lower spending in other more important areas. Whilst it would be beneficial to allow people to move around freely, it would be very hard to sustain. Public transport already requires improvement and, with rail workers striking over pay, it would put pressure and demand on a system which is already struggling to cope. We should make it free for those who are vulnerable such as those with disabilities and chronic illnesses. Also, without income from fares the quality of the service might be compromised.

We should make it free for those who are vulnerable such as those with disabilities and chronic illnesses. Also, without income from fares the quality of the service might be compromised. If it was to be made free for all, then a credible improvement in public transport would have to be implemented in order to make the increased usage of the service bearable for users. Also, people need to know that although the service would be free, tax payer money will be funding it so everyone should use public transport as efficiently as possible.
