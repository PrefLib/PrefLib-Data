# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the UK breaking up into four separate countries. The majority of the group felt that the UK is stronger together and that we should not break apart. However, it was also felt that the UK has many issues that need to be addressed and that these issues should be tackled by a more unified UK government. The group felt that a more unified government would be able to distribute resources more equally and fairly across the UK. The group also felt that the UK government should be more accountable to the people and that this could be achieved by making voting compulsory.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should not become independent countries. The nations are stronger together, with more influence on the world stage. The cost of living crisis in the UK is not caused by the nations being together, but by the Brexit vote. If the nations were to become independent, they would be extremely small countries, with very little financial security, which would mean that life for the average member of the public would be more difficult. As an example, just look at the cost of living crisis and the difficulties in trade etc, because of Brexit. This is the same principle, except the countries would be even smaller and have even less influence on global politics and issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is no compelling evidence for the countries of the UK to become independent. In general, the group was opposed to the idea of independence for the countries of the UK. The general feeling was that the countries are stronger together, and that there is no compelling reason for them to become independent. There was a feeling that the UK government is not fit for purpose, and that the distribution of resources and services is not equitable across the UK. However, it was felt that there is no evidence to suggest that the countries would be better off if they were independent. It was also felt that there would be an enormous cost and amount of time required to separate the countries politically, and that there is not enough of a compelling case to move forward with independence.
