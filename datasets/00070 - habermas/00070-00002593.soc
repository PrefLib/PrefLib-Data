# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No we shouldn't. The highest earners should shoulder the highest burden of tax. At a time when we have a large debt burden and cost of living crisis it is only right that people earning a salary that is many times over the median salary should contribute more in percentage terms.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No I do not agree that it should be lowered and in fact I think it is in fact the the tax for the lower rate of income that should be lowered. It should be the high earners we are taxing more (the millionaires, billionaires, the tax-dodging big corporations and Tory MPs in the UK) and who should be paying the highest tax levels to ensure that those who are lower earners are not suffering by having to pay so much tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, by reducing the income tax from 45% to 30% we are essentially taking money away from the economy and at the same time giving money back to the wealthiest families. For this reason I do not believe this would be a good move for the country and in some cases the tax should possibly be higher depending on industry and situation. If the tax rate was to change then the money gone would have to come out of a budget for something else which will most likely have an impact on the more working/middle class members of society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, in fact, I very much believe that we should increase it. As the cost of living crisis and the rising inflation are destroying millions of families across the country, rich people are continuing to increase their wealth without a care in the world about those suffering. We need to seriously strive for higher equality and make the workplace more fair where everyone gets their share of the profits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: No - the people that earn the top rate of income tax earn more than what is required to live a comfortable life. As such, they should continue to pay 45% tax, and in turn help those less fortunate than themselves and help fund public services which are already struggling with low funding. Furthermore, tax cuts for those in the top rate of income tax would surely result in tax rises for those in the lower income tax bands, which can be seen as unfair, as they may already be struggling to get by as it is.
