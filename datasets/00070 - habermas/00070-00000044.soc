# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: This group of participants was generally opposed to the eating of dogs, although this may be due to the strong emotional ties between people and dogs in most cultures. Some cultures do eat dogs, and in some of these cultures the emotional ties are not as strong. The issue is complicated by the range of definitions and applications of 'dogs' - for example some 'dogs' are actually wolf-hybrids and there is an ongoing debate as to whether this is acceptable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Most of the group did not want to eat dogs, and in fact, the group did not want anyone to eat dogs. This is based on the cultural closeness between people and dogs in many cultures. The closeness is largely due to the emotional bonds between people and dogs, which are clearly shown by the emotional expressions of dogs. However, in some Eastern cultures dogs are eaten, perhaps due to less emotional bonds between people and dogs. It is also due to the fact that other meats are less available to consume. Some people also question whether it is acceptable to eat wolf-hybrids.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to eating dogs. All agreed that dogs are special animals in most cultures, and there are close emotional ties between people and dogs. It is also acknowledged that some cultures do eat dogs, and the emotional ties and feelings of people about dogs are less strong. There is an ongoing debate as to whether it is acceptable to consume wolf-hybrids, but in general it is felt that eating dogs is not a desirable practice, and is unnecessary in most cases.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is a strong general opinion that dogs are special animals with strong emotional ties with humans, and that it is not generally considered acceptable to eat dogs in most cultures. However, it is acknowledged that in some cultures it is considered acceptable to eat dogs, although there are some people who do not wish to consume any animal products at all.
