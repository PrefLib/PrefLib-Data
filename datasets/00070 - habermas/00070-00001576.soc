# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We have debated the topic for a long time and come to the conclusion that it should be easier for asylum seekers to enter the country. We have noted the arguments for and against. We have also noted that the UK does not actually have a policy regarding this. We do not think the UK should have a policy because this is too draconian and it is unlikely to be followed, given the UK's colonial past. We feel it should be the responsibility of the UK government to do what is best in the interests of its people. In line with this, the UK should make it easier for asylum seekers to enter the country. This will also help the government to keep track of who is coming in, and the situation they are coming from.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK should change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country. This will reduce the number of people who are forced to make dangerous journeys to enter the country, and will also help the government to keep track of the number of people entering the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think that we should not change our asylum-seeking policy, because people will think that it is too easy to come to the UK and will take advantage of the system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country. The current system is very prohibitive and makes it very difficult for those in need to enter the country. The system is also very bureaucratic and slow, which is a problem for those who are in desperate need of help. The UK has a lot of resources and is a very wealthy country, and should be able to accommodate those in need. The UK has a lot to answer for in terms of foreign policy and its colonial past, and should be taking responsibility for the problems it has caused. The UK has a lot of skilled workers from other countries, and it would be beneficial for the UK to make it easier for asylum seekers to enter the country.
