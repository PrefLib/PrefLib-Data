# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People on lower incomes are already struggling as it is without adding even more stress onto them. The pandemic and Ukraine war have left people much poorer. Causing poverty is immoral. There is currently a big cost of living crisis therefore the UK should not raise taxes. People are struggling to afford everyday essentials so this will only make the cost of living crisis worse. The government should be looking at other ways to clear the national debt. The group of participants have come to the consensus view that the UK should not raise taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the UK should not raise taxes to reduce the size of the national debt. The pandemic and Ukraine war have left people much poorer. Causing poverty is immoral. There is currently a big cost of living crisis therefore the UK should not raise taxes. People are struggling to afford everyday essentials so this will only make the cost of living crisis worse. The government should be looking at other ways to clear the national debt. I agree with the principle of raising taxes to reduce the national debt but it needs to be done in the fairest possible way. Currently individuals in the UK are taxed at a very high level and that is increasing, however major corporations and the very wealthy are able to use methods to greatly minimise their tax liability so they do not pay their far share pro rata. If the tax burden for this was put on those people than it would be ok but not if it is to be put on the ordinary working public who are already over taxed in relation to corporations and very wealthy individuals. No it shouldn't. People on lower incomes are already struggling as it is without adding even more stress onto them. I didn't get the UK into the debt its in so why am I having to foot the bill for
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to raising taxes but did not feel that there should be a blanket ban on raising taxes. They felt that taxes should be raised on certain groups, but not on others. The participants felt that the wealthy should be taxed more but that this should not be at the expense of those on lower incomes. The participants felt that the wealthy would be able to afford a tax increase and that it would not have a significant impact on their quality of life. The participants felt that the tax increase would help to reduce the national debt.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to raising taxes to reduce the size of the national debt. They felt that the national debt was a political issue and should not be the concern of the general public. It was agreed that the current tax system was not fair, with people on lower incomes paying more than their fair share and the wealthy and corporations not paying enough. However, it was felt that this was a separate issue and that the current tax system should be reformed rather than people's taxes being raised. It was agreed that the people on lower incomes were already struggling and that raising their taxes would be immoral and cause more poverty.
