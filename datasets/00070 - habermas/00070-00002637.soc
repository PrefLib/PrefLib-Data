# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I do not particularly want to promote using cannabis for young people, however I feel it is wrong to blanket say no, when there are emerging medicinal uses that show significant benefit and impact.  In fact, I'm sure that cannabis has been used in past historic times and likely prehistoric times.  I think there is a distorting of the information we are being given as to it's potential benefits and safety.  Another issue is really about who controls it and makes money from it, it's something that big pharma would struggle to control, so I wonder if a lot of what we are being informed as fact is really simply the plan to control how we use or think on it so that it can be produced and marketed and profited from.  I would also need more information to identify the term 'young people' - are we talking of adults over 18 or young teenagers? 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Firstly, it depends how you define 'young'. Is this under 18, under 21 etc? I don't thing 'young' people, ie under 21, have the life experience to be experimenting with a drug such as cannabis. If it were to be legalised, it should only be accessible to over 21's.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There are vast amounts of evidence that suggest that cannabis does far more good than bad when ingested. It is used to treat various medical conditions including epilepsy and anxiety and should be available for medical consumption first and foremost. However, it would be ignorant of me not to comment on the recreational use of cannabis and similarly to its medicinal use, recreationally it poses no great risk to people, including young people who decide to partake. Overall, young people should be able to use cannabis in both medicinal and recreational settings.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: This is a difficult one. I think everything in moderation is ok. I think if a person is a light user than there isn't much risk but a heavy user could be at risk of health issues. i think it should be up to the individual to decide what they want to do as long as they are aware of the consequences.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I think cannabis can be used occasionally and infrequently by young people. Consideration needs to be given to what age 'young people' are classed as. I do have concerns about the risk of psychosis but there are also benefits to cannabis use such as decreased social anxiety and decreased pain in people suffering from chronic pain
