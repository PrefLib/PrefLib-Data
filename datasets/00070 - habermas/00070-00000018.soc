# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a requirement for all companies to publish data on the pay gap between men and women. The published data should not be in specific terms and should take into consideration factors such as hours worked. The published data would help to facilitate transparency and could contribute to future policies that may help to address gender inequality.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We agree that it would be useful to require companies to disclose general information on the pay gap between men and women.  We think that this information could lead to a more equal approach to salaries.  We do not think that it should be mandatory to publish individual's salaries, as this would be an unnecessary invasion of privacy.  We do not think that the definition of gender should be made clearer.  There are too many people who are neither male or female.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We do not think that companies should be required to publish data on the pay gap between men and women as there are many reasons why men are paid more than women (they often work more hours than women, for example).  A pay gap is not in itself proof that discrimination is taking place.  We believe that it is important to publish the overall number of men and women in each job category (such as administration, management, etc.) but not the actual salaries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a requirement for all companies to publish data on the pay gap between men and women.  There should be a breakdown of the figures for specific jobs.  However, the data should not include details of individual's salaries.  It is crucial that women are valued in the same way as men, and we think that this data would help towards that goal.
