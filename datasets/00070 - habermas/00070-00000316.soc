# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, our current electoral system works well. However, there is scope for minor improvements in the way that the system is operated, rather than changes to the actual system itself.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, the electoral system does not need to be changed, however, the voting age should be reduced to 16 years of age.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The electoral system should be changed to an alternative vote system (AVE) but the voting age should not be reduced to 16. We should not make this change until the next election to ensure that our government is representative of all views and that all views are taken into account in the creation of this new system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe the electoral system should be changed. We believe a fairer system would be better for all the parties, especially the smaller ones.
