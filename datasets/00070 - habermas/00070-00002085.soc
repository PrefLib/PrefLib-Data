# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the state is not doing enough to reduce violent crime. Violent crime is becoming an increasingly worrying problem in the UK, and the government is not doing enough to combat it. They are not taking enough action against knife crime, and are not providing enough support for the police to deal with the problem.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the state is not doing enough to reduce violent crime. The funding for the police is very low. There are also not enough laws and penalties to deter people from committing violent crimes. Criminals are also avoiding jail and reoffending time and time again. The police also do not have enough power to react against criminals and the whole situation is a mess. Teenagers are roaming around with knives acting like they are invincible. The state should also analyse the crime numbers and take action from there. They should also add more regulations to gun crimes to reduce the death toll.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, the group of participants have come to the consensus opinion that the state is not doing enough to reduce violent crime. They have argued that the state should analyse the crime numbers and take action from there. They should also add more regulations to gun crimes to reduce the death toll. The group of participants have also argued that the funding for the state is not enough. The punishment is also too low which means it does not deter people from committing violent crime. The group of participants have also argued that the police do not have enough power to react against criminals and the whole situation is a mess. Teenagers roam around with knifes acting like they are invincible. The group of participants have also argued that London especially is becoming notorious worldwide for being effectively a failed society - daylight robbery is commonplace, more campaigns are being started to raise attention to the existing knife crime problem, and even firearms are being illegally imported and put into dangerous hands at a higher rate than ever.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The state is not doing enough to reduce violent crime. They should start looking at what they are doing right and wrong, and should be looking at implementing more preventative measures and schemes, so that young people are not entering the world of crime.
