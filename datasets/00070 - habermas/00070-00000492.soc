# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I think we should maintain the amount of migrant workers in the UK. There is no consensus on this issue as there are many benefits and downsides to immigration. We do not believe that we should allow more or less as we feel that the number of immigrants in the UK is appropriate at the moment. We may change our view as more information is given.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the number of migrant workers allowed into the UK should be decreased, but there are some specific areas where there are gaps in our economy where we need more workers to help us to thrive. In particular, farming and caring roles have gaps in our workforce which we should be trying to fill with people who are willing to work hard and contribute to our society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should increase the number of migrant workers allowed into the UK, however this should be limited to certain industries where we are in great need of workers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe the number of migrant workers should be reduced by a significant amount. Unemployment in the UK is currently very low and this means that it will be easier for people in the UK to fill jobs. It would also help to reduce some of the issues that have arisen in some areas, such as the London housing crisis, overcrowding in cities and social cohesion.
