# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we should not lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers. The wealthiest taxpayers have more than enough money and should be paying more into the tax pot rather than less. The government needs to be able to fund all the things society needs like the NHS etc and high earners do pay into the community by buying lots of things so maybe they should be reduced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While it is an important goal for people to have an incentive to achieve the best they can, we cannot lower taxes for the wealthiest people. Our most important resource is people and if we are to achieve a good society, it is important that we provide the necessary services and support for people to be able to be healthy and make the most of their lives. If we reduce tax income from the wealthiest people, this will impact on our ability to provide these services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, we should not lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers. The wealthiest taxpayers have more than enough money and should be paying more into the tax pot rather than less. The wealthiest taxpayers are able to afford higher taxes and it would not discourage them from earning as much as they can. Lowering taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers would mean less money available to pay for vital services. The wealthiest taxpayers should be using their money to help others rather than keeping it all for themselves.
