# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Absolutely no tax on meat. I'm not usually a meat eater by choice, as I do sometimes if I fancy it. we may as well put taxes on all food as this is the way it's going to end up. Why would it be a reasonable thing to do on meat. Meat has been eaten since the beginning of time why would they? 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I can't see why. On the whole, I believe we are taxed too much already and some of these taxes are by stealth. I can't think of many taxes on foods or even things like tobacco and alcohol that have ever achieved what they aimed to do- unless the aim was to put more money in the government's coffers.  In my opinion taxes on meat (or any other food) are a cop-out from dealing with the issue of meat production head on and shows weak leadership and is simply an appeasing strategy and no more. I have never seen any evidence of food taxes being affective.  Instead, they (as often is the case) penalise the vulnerable and the least well-off in society, which is not on. I don't agree with this. Any food strategy must have meat and this doesn't!
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I'm not really sure what the need for this would be. Is it to stop cheap factory farmed meat from abroad? Is it to encourage more people to vegetarianism? I think most people are already having a tough time at the moment with the cost of living crisis so have probably already cut down on meat consumption.  I m a vegetarian myself and would love for more people to stop eating meat but I wouldn't force them to by overpricing it so it unaffordable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Again another tricky question. I do not believe that the way to try and make change involves taxing someone for making a decision. At the end of the day eating meat comes down to to the individual and it is their choice. I do not think that an increased tax is going to stop people from eating meat (if this is the goal) just by making it a little more expensive. It is too black and white. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I do not think there should be an increased tax on meat. While I agree that excessive human consumption of meat (meat produced through industrial farming, anyway) has negative impacts for people's health, animal rights, and for the planet in terms of increased carbon emissions, I do not think that introducing a 'meat tax' is necessarily the best way to solve these problems. During a cost of living crisis, a lot of people already struggle to buy healthy, protein-rich food to feed themselves. Meat can be a big part of a healthy diet. When it comes to solving the aforementioned questions, perhaps the best way to do that is via a tax on factory farms themselves. Higher welfare, smaller farms could be taxed less. Less supply = higher costs = less consumption
