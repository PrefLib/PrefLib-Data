# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The world is a shared resource, and it is everyone's responsibility to ensure it is not harmed by their own actions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There is a shared responsibility for ensuring that the environment is not harmed by individual actions. Everyone needs to be responsible for their own impact on the environment. Education on the impact of individual actions is essential, so that people are able to make informed decisions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There is a growing awareness of the impact we as humans have on the environment. Some changes in lifestyle can reduce this impact, and should be made. However, all people need to realise that there are limits to what individuals can do, and some of the bigger changes need to come from government policy and business operations.
