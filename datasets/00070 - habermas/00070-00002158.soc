# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Health is a human right. It is not a commodity. The right to be healthy as a human being should not rely on your ability to pay for care or drugs. If we want to have a strong economy, how can we expect people to work to their best when they cannot afford the healthcare to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The NHS is a key part of the fabric of our society and as such should be protected. It is designed to support everyone in the community equally and if we start to allow privatisation, there will be two tiers of healthcare, where only the wealthy will have access to top quality treatment. There is already a shortage of staff within the NHS. If we were to start to rely on private companies to provide a percentage of our healthcare, it is likely that even more NHS staff would leave for private jobs, as there is a higher level of pay and more scope for advancement. This would lead to an even more desperate shortage of staff and it is likely that waiting times for treatment would increase even more. There would be even more stress on our overstretched hospitals. If we have free healthcare in the UK, there is no incentive for people to have private healthcare, as they would be double paying for the same treatment. Therefore, we believe that it is in the best interests of the country to protect our current system of free healthcare and not allow privatisation to erode it further.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Healthcare should be free for all citizens and we should not privatise the industry as we don't want to lose the right to free healthcare at the point of use. It is immoral to deny someone healthcare just because they can't afford it. The NHS should remain as it is. We should also consider making health care free for visitors to the country as well as citizens. This is a very good way to showcase the best of the UK and also means that the government doesn't have to pay for healthcare for foreigners when they are here in this country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should nationalise the private health care industry. Health is a human right. It is not a commodity. The right to be healthy as a human being should not rely on your ability to pay for care or drugs. If we want to have a strong economy, how can we expect people to work to their best when they cannot afford the healthcare to do so. The situation in America is a good example of how a capitalist mentality is detrimental to a caring society. The welfare system in this country - of which the NHS is a part - is designed to provide shared community, a safety net for everyone and should be protected at all costs. It we insisted on charging for healthcare in this country through privatisation the country would pay more in the long run through poor health and lifestyles. It would be a false economy.
