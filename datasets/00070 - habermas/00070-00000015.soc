# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, smoking in public places should be banned. Smoking is not only harmful to the smoker, but is also an unethical health hazard to others nearby. The effects of smoking on the health of those nearby are immediate and long term. There is evidence to support this. Banning smoking in public places would significantly decrease the level of passive smoking by reducing exposure of non-smokers to toxic fumes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Question: Should we ban all smoking in public places?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should ban smoking in all public places.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Smoking should be banned in all public places. The health of everyone is more important than the rights of a few to damage the health of others by their habit.
