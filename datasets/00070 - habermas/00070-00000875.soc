# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be more taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. The health costs of both cigarettes and alcohol are significant, and are only getting worse. Taxing these products will increase the cost to the consumer, which will in turn discourage consumption of both. The additional revenue can be used to help people suffering from the effects of these substances, and to prevent people from starting to consume these substances. It can also be used to fund research into more efficient, and cost-effective methods of treating addiction and the diseases related to consumption of both products.

Taxing these products will increase the cost to the consumer, which will in turn discourage consumption of both. The additional revenue can be used to help people suffering from the effects of these substances, and to prevent people from starting to consume these substances. The additional revenue could be used to implement stricter tobacco and alcohol advertising regulations in order to keep these products out of the sight of children. The additional revenue could also be used to fund more awareness programs and seminars in schools in order to inform young people on the dangers of these substances, and also the importance of delaying or abstaining altogether from using these substances.

The additional revenue can be used to help people suffering from the effects of these substances, and to prevent people from starting to consume these substances. Also, the additional funding could go to improving our educational system and add public health awareness to the curriculum. The issues caused by cigarettes and alcohol are significantly detrimental to the country and by adding taxes, we are simultaneously educating our society and curtailing the problem.

The additional revenue can be used to help people suffering from the effects of these substances, and to prevent people from starting to consume these substances. More can also be done with the additional revenue. It can be used to fund a greater advertising presence discouraging the use of cigarettes and alcohol, and education programs regarding the risks of using these products. A bigger proportion of this advertising money should be targeted at a younger demographic, to discourage initiation of use. A more diversified range of targets could be used in adverts. Most campaigns use characters who people look up to, often people in TV. These should be combined with people who people would normally emulate but not for their virtues. This would show what cigarettes and alcohol really do to a person. Finally, some of the additional revenue can be used in helping communities where many members are already using the products, reducing consumption at the end of the harm curve.
