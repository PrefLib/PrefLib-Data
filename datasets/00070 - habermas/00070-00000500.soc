# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should legalise the cultivation and consumption of magic mushrooms as this would lead to a decrease in crime and people would be more aware of the health effects of these substances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the consensus that the legalization of magic mushrooms is the best solution for this issue. We believe that this will allow it to be better controlled by those who are authorized to do so. This will also allow for it to be better regulated in order to ensure that it is used properly for the purposes that it was intended for. This would also decrease the crime rates in the country as a whole because of the lack of need for the importation of class A drugs. This is an important point because of the number of crime-related incidents that have been happening in the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - MAGIC MUSHROOMS SHOULD NOT BE LEGALISED BECAUSE IT IS TOO DANGEROUS TO LET THEM BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL NOT END UP IN THE WRONG HANDS AND AS A RESULT OF THIS THEY MAY NOT BE USED FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE. THERE IS A HIGH RISK OF OVERDOSE IF TOO MANY MAGIC MUSHROOMS ARE EATEN AND AS A RESULT OF THIS THERE IS A HIGH CHANCE OF ACCIDENTS, HARM TO OTHERS AND EVEN DEATH. IN THE FUTURE THERE MAY BE AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF MAGIC MUSHROOMS, AND AS A RESULT OF THIS THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING THEM. THIS WILL LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS, HARM TO OTHERS AND EVEN DEATH.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, we believe that legalizing magic mushrooms for recreational purposes could have a positive impact on the country and decrease crime rates.
