# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final consensus statement: In general, the group was in favour of allowing more immigration to boost the economy. The group felt that immigration is good for the economy, as it helps businesses to grow and thrive, and it is also good for the UK as it helps us to become a more multicultural society. The group felt that an immigrant should be able to speak and understand English before they are allowed to enter the UK, as this is of great importance to being able to integrate well. The group felt that it is very important for immigrants to integrate into UK society, and be able to keep up with everyday topics discussed in the media. The group felt that there should be a cap on the number of immigrants that are allowed into the UK each year, but immigrants should not need to go through a lengthy and expensive process to get visas.  The group felt that there should be a system in place to ensure that immigrants are not a burden on the UK economy, and that immigrants should have skills and the financial means to support themselves. The group felt that the current immigration system is too complicated and that it should be simplified so that all immigrants go through the same process, and to make it easier for companies to recruit staff from overseas.
