# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of building a new runway at Heathrow Airport. However, they were also of the opinion that the airport should be more efficient and that they should be looking at other ways of improving the airport and reducing the environmental impact of flights. They were also of the opinion that the airport should be looking at other ways of doing business and reducing the need for air travel.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In principle, the building of a third runway at Heathrow Airport would be a good idea as it would help London to be a leader in business and travel. However, we are not sure whether the economy will recover sufficiently in the short term to justify the cost of building the runway. The environmental impact of the new runway is also a concern, and the cost-benefit analysis of building the runway would need to take this into account.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In principle, the group is in favour of a new runway at Heathrow, but we do not think the current economic situation is right for this to go ahead. We believe the new runway would bring major economic benefits to the country and to London, but we do not think that this outweighs the impact on the local community and the potential impact on the environment. We think that a new runway would be beneficial for the UK and for London in the long term, but we do not think that the current economic situation is right for this to go ahead. We think that the environmental impact of building a new runway at Heathrow would be lower than building a new airport, but we are concerned about the potential increase in flights. We think that the new runway would be beneficial for the UK and for London in the long term, but we do not think that the current economic situation is right for this to go ahead.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of expanding Heathrow Airport. The benefits of this would be to increase capacity and allow more flights to be made. This would increase business and help the economy. However, the group was aware of the negative impact this would have on the local community and the environment. The group felt that the government should consider how to mitigate these negative impacts.
