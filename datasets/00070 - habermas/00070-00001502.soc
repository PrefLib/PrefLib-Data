# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, non-essential cosmetic surgery should not be banned.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While we do not believe all non-essential cosmetic surgery should be banned, there should be more regulations in place to stop the exploitation of women and girls. While such procedures can be medically unnecessary, they can have huge impacts on a person's mental health and confidence, which is a worthy cause. These procedures can also benefit medial research and may produce finding that could enhance future essential procedures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We think that we should not ban non-essential cosmetic surgery, but we do think that more regulations should be put in place to make sure that the cosmetic surgery industry does not exploit women and girls. It is up to the individual to decide what they do with their body, especially when they fund it themselves. We also believe that cosmetic surgery can help enhance someone's mental health and confidence, which is a worthy cause. Finally, we believe that cosmetic surgery can benefit medical research and may produce findings that could enhance future essential procedures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, cosmetic surgery should not be banned as it can have a hugely positive impact on people's mental health and confidence.
