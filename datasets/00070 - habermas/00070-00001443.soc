# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - While the happiness of others is an important factor to consider, our own happiness is our ultimate goal. In order to be a happy person, it is necessary to be a good person. In order to be a good person, we must do what is right, even if that means sacrificing our own immediate happiness. But in the end, the happiness of others will come back to us in many positive ways.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although there are those in the world who don’t believe in helping others, we feel that we cannot behave in a selfish way if we are to have an enjoyable life. However, we feel it is also important to try to be a good person for the sake of others. Doing what is right even if it means sacrificing your own immediate happiness will contribute to your own happiness in the long term and will ultimately lead to overall happiness. Discussion
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Being a good person is important for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, it is important to be a good person to contribute to society and to other people’s happiness. Secondly, being a good person can also contribute to our own happiness, as it is our own happiness that is the ultimate goal. Being a good person means that we must do what is right, even if that means sacrificing our own immediate happiness. However, in the end, the happiness of others will come back to us in many positive ways.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Being a good person is more important than being a happy person, because you can be happy by being a good person, but you cannot be a good person by being happy.
