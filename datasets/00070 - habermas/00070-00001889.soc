# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We think that companies with 250 or more employees should be required to disclose their gender pay gap. We think that it should be transparent and not shrouded in secrecy. The pay gap issue is one that has gone on for too long and has a negative effect on our society. We believe it is essential for companies to have gender equality in the workplace and that this should be shown in their pay structure.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, gender pay gap is not acceptable. Transparent disclosure of gender pay gaps would promote accountability and allow companies to address pay disparities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that all UK companies with more than 250 employees should be required to disclose their gender pay gap. The gender pay gap is a problem that has gone on for far too long. It is inconceivable that some people are paid less than others for the equivalent work. There should be no distinction. Wages should be transparent and a white male should not be earning more than anyone else because of historic opinions. An organisation of 250 is large enough for information to be relevant and applicable. We need to move towards zero pay gap and people should know that they are being paid the same as someone else - it is not a subject that should be shrouded in secrecy.
