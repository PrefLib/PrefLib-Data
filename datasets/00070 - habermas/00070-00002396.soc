# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The NHS is worth the cost because it provides equal access to healthcare, no matter your background, which should be a right of living in my opinion.    In other countries where the NHS or similar systems do not exist, an accident could totally derail someone's life, where they may have to go to extremes such as selling your house, or forfeiting their education to pay medical bills, which is totally not okay.    Our national health service is a gem and should be protected at all costs.    We have to be careful that american style privatisation via the back door can't happen - espcially with the current government who would love this to happen.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The NHS is a vital part of the UK, and is well worth its cost. It provides equal access to healthcare for all, no matter their background, and is a right that all people should have. It is something that we should be proud of, and should protect at all costs. We should be wary of any privatisation of the NHS, and ensure that it remains free at the point of use for all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The NHS is an important institution in the UK and is something that should be protected and maintained.   The NHS is a key part of the fabric of our society and we are very lucky to have it.   We should be very careful that it is not eroded by american style privatisation which would be a disaster for the country.   We should be very careful that we do not end up in a situation where people have to pay for healthcare and where the health service becomes a profit making business.   This would be a disaster for the country.   We should also be careful that the health service is not run down by successive governments.   It is something that is very important to the people of this country and we should be careful that it is not damaged by the current government who would love to privatise it.   We should be very careful that the NHS is protected and maintained.   We should also be careful that the NHS is not damaged by the current government who would love to privatise it.
