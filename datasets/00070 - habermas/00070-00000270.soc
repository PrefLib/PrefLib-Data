# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “The idea of a maximum wage is a controversial one, as it raises questions about individual rights and government control. While some argue that a maximum wage would promote income equality and discourage excessive wealth accumulation, others argue that it would be difficult to implement and could disincetivize innovation and entrepreneurship. The idea may be popular with the proletariat, but it would be a disaster for the country if high value workers were to migrate to countries that have no maximum wage, as this would lead to a skills shortage. We need to think carefully about the issue before deciding what we think on the matter.”

While some argue that a maximum wage would promote income equality and discourage excessive wealth accumulation, others argue that it would be difficult to implement and could disincetivize innovation and entrepreneurship. Anyone considering the idea of a maximum wage should be aware that a maximum wage would most likely drive away skilled workers, who would go to countries with no maximum wage. This would lead to a skills shortage, which would be disastrous for the economy.”
