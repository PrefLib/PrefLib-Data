# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a maximum amount of time that a person can hold public office, in order to prevent a political class from forming and to allow new people to gain access to public office. This prevents the accumulation of power in one person’s hands and allows fresh ideas and new perspectives to be heard. Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We agree that there should be a maximum amount of time that a person can hold public office, in order to prevent a political class from forming and to allow new people to gain access to public office. This prevents the accumulation of power in one person’s hands and allows fresh ideas and new perspectives to be heard. It also allows a check on the possibility of old age and senility coming into play when making decisions. This way people can gain experience without becoming too comfortable in their role. We are unsure how long this maximum should be and this is something we would like to debate further.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a maximum amount of time that a person can hold public office, in order to prevent a political class from forming and to allow new people to gain access to public office. This prevents the accumulation of power in one person’s hands and allows fresh ideas and new perspectives to be heard. It also allows a check on the possibility of old age and senility coming into play when making decisions.
