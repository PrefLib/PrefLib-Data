# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “No, we shouldn't encourage everyone to get a degree, but we should try to make it easier to access higher education, as it does come with many benefits.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I believe that we should always encourage people to learn. Learning is for everyone and is the key to opening minds. However I do not believe that people should be put under pressure to get a degree and I also believe that a degree is not suitable for everyone. There are many benefits to gaining a degree such as improved job prospects, higher salary, meeting new people, gaining new skills and a greater knowledge. However there are also downsides to gaining a degree such as the large amount of debt which is put upon people, the university fees are extremely expensive and unfair, and the stress and hard work which comes with a degree. For many people the pros may outweigh the cons however for some the cons may outweigh the pros. I think this question is a personal choice and a decision which everyone should make for themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There are many benefits to getting a degree, including broadening your mind, expanding your education and also improving income. However, it is not suitable for everyone. People can have great careers through apprenticeships or other routes and some people don't want the debt that comes with it. We should encourage everyone to get a degree, but also be aware that it is not the only option.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be more encouragement to pursue a degree, however it should be more accessible to a broader range of students.
