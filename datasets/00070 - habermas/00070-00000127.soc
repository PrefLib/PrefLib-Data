# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, our society is not doing enough to fight climate change. Despite growing awareness of the issue, many individuals and government continue to prioritise short-term economic gain over long-term environmental sustainability. It is important to recognise that society is a very broad term and many different people are fighting climate change in different ways. Some individuals are working towards becoming carbon neutral and implementing sustainable practices in their everyday lives, while others are taking to the streets to protest in support of change. In a broader sense, many organisations such as charities are fighting climate change by advocating for change. For example, the WWF and 350.org. Despite this, however, not enough is being done to fight climate change. If we are to slow the effects of climate change, we need more people to become aware of the issue and support a move towards sustainable practices, including the government and industries, as they have a major role to play in fighting climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Our society is not doing enough to fight climate change. While there are many individuals who are doing their best to reduce their carbon footprint and are advocating for change, not enough is being done to fight climate change. This is particularly the case with governments and large industries which are acting contrary to the interests of humanity by supporting unsustainable practices that are causing climate change. If we are to make a change, more people must be aware of the issue and advocate for action. It is crucial that governments and industries around the world take action to reduce the impacts of climate change. Fight Climate Change! This section of the website presents a range of ways that you can reduce your carbon footprint. From solar powered garden lights to the effects of fracking, the following pages present a range of issues and possible solutions to climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is growing awareness of climate change, but it is not enough. We need more people to become aware of the issue and support a move towards sustainable practices, including the government and industries, as they have a major role to play in fighting climate change. The vast majority of climate change related research and work is coming from independent groups and organisations. For example, the WWF and 350.org. Government support is sorely lacking, as climate change is not being taken seriously enough and not enough is being done to fight it. Overall, not enough is being done to fight climate change. If we are to slow the effects of climate change, we need more people to become aware of the issue and support a move towards sustainable practices, including the government and industries, as they have a major role to play in fighting climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Our society as a whole is not doing enough to fight climate change. While many individuals are taking small steps towards being more sustainable, including implementing sustainable practices in their everyday lives, and many organisations such as charities are fighting climate change by advocating for change, not enough is being done to fight climate change. If we are to slow the effects of climate change, we need more people to become aware of the issue and support a move towards sustainable practices, including the government and industries, as they have a major role to play in fighting climate change.
