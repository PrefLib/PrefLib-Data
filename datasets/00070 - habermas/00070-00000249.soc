# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not reduce the voting age to 12. 12 year olds do not have a well-informed opinion about politics and therefore would not know who to vote for or why they are voting for them. We believe that 12 year olds are not ready to vote for their political leaders.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we should not reduce voting age to 12 because most 12 year olds will not understand the most important political issues. They should be allowed to be children instead of worrying about current political issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, we should not reduce the voting age to 12 because a child at 12 is too young to vote and does not have an understanding of what voting is about.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No. 12 is too young an age to make a decision on who we want to be our leaders and the votes of 12 year olds will not be as well informed as older people. 12 year olds should be allowed to be children and vote when they are old enough to understand what voting is for and the impact of their vote.
