# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Fluoride is a useful component to put in water, however, the addition of fluoride should be done so with caution and awareness. The amount should be small enough that it does not disrupt the ecosystem of water, yet large enough that it provides benefits to humans. While fluoride has the ability to prevent decay, there is a possibility of overdose if taken in large quantities, which is why fluoride should not be taken in large quantities. This means fluoride should not be taken in large quantities and should be taken in small quantities. It should not be forced upon people and be a choice.
