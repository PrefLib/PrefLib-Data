# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the current voting system in the UK works well. However, there are some aspects of the system that could be improved. The most important of these is the frequency of elections. The current system allows the party in power to call an election whenever they want, which gives them an unfair advantage. This should be changed so that elections are held on a regular basis. Every four years has been suggested, but could be reduced or increased depending on the political situation. This will ensure that the government is held accountable for their actions, and will also make it harder for the government to call an election at a time that suits them. This will bring us into line with the election systems of most other countries, who often hold elections based on fixed dates rather than at the whim of the political party in power. I am very proud to be British and Australian. Anyone that is prejudiced should get out of the country. They are not welcome. And yes that means anyone black, white, arab, jewish, asian, atheist, gay, straight, male, female, transgendered or anything in between. What is illegal in this country should be illegal in every country. If you don't

This should be enshrined in legislation, and will ensure that elections are not called at politically opportune times.

This will ensure that the government is held accountable for their actions, and will also make it harder for the government to call an election at a time that suits them. The group of participants also agreed that further debate was needed, as a number of opinions had not been taken into account in the final consensus statement. The group felt that it would be important to do further research on the subject, as they had not been able to come to a consensus view on all aspects of the question.

This will ensure that the government is held accountable for their actions, and will also make it harder for the government to call an election at a time that suits them. The reason we think the frequency should be every four years (or close to that) is that it allows enough time for the government to make the changes they want to make. However, in this time the government is also being held accountable for the things they have done, as well as making it harder for the government to call the election whenever they want. Our view is that this is the best compromise, as we do not want the elections to be so frequent that they are only serving to introduce unneeded instability, while allowing the government to be held to account for the things they have done.
