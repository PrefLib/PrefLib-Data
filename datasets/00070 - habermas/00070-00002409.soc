# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Prevention is always better than cure. This is because prevention can help to reduce the number of people who get sick and also reduce the severity of illness. Therefore, there will be less pressure on the health service and more people will be able to get the care they need. Prevention is also more cost effective than cure. This is because prevention can be achieved through relatively inexpensive methods such as immunisation and health education. Cure, however, is often very expensive and can involve invasive and painful procedures. Prevention is also better because it can help to reduce the number of deaths from illness and increase life expectancy. Therefore, prevention is better than cure.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, it is better to focus on prevention than cure. This is mainly because prevention is always cheaper than cure. Prevention also leads to a healthier population and a lower disease burden. This in turn leads to a higher quality of life for the population. Prevention is also beneficial to the individual. It is common knowledge that prevention is better than cure. This is mainly because curative measures are always very expensive not only for the individual but also for the government. Examples of periods where prevention techniques such as immunization, quarantine etc played vital role includes the COVID epidemic. Also, curative measures may not lead to full restoration of the health of the individual even after spending alot of money. In addition, curative measures have their own merits. In particular, they improve life expectancy. The development of new and effective cures also drives innovation and investment in new areas of science and medicine. Moreover, new cures may lead to the discovery of ways to prevent the same diseases from occurring in the first place. In general, prevention is still better than cure. However, curative measures should not be ignored or downplayed. The two approaches should complement each other and lead to a healthier population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, we have come to the conclusion that prevention is better than cure. By focusing on prevention, we can reduce the spread of diseases and illnesses. In addition, we can lower the number of people suffering from these illnesses, which will make it easier to develop a cure as there will be less people requiring it. However, we should not rule out the possibility of developing a cure. By developing a cure, we can ensure that people can live a full and happy life, even if they have been diagnosed with a disease or illness. We should invest in prevention and cure, but put more emphasis on prevention.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, it is better to focus on prevention than cure. This is mainly because prevention is always cheaper than cure. Prevention also leads to a healthier population and a lower disease burden. This in turn leads to a higher quality of life for the population. Prevention also leads to a reduction in the number of cases that would require cure. This would free up resources to focus on other areas. Prevention is also beneficial to the individual. It is common knowledge that prevention is better than cure. This is mainly because curative measures are always very expensive not only for the individual but also for the government. Examples of periods where prevention techniques such as immunization, quarantine etc played vital role includes the COVID epidemic. Also, curative measures may not lead to full restoration of the health of the individual even after spending alot of money. However, it has to be noted that prevention measures have to be taken and administered effectively and in a timely manner. Otherwise, curative measures may have to be implemented.
