# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, women should be allowed to serve in the military. There is no good reason why they shouldn’t, and there are many areas where women can be just as useful as men in the military. It is no secret that women have been a valuable asset in war in the past, especially in more recent times. However, in more recent wars we have seen women come to the front lines as snipers and combat pilots. The role of women in the military has changed dramatically in the past 50 years and this must be reflected in the policies. We must ensure that women and men are allowed to serve in the military in an equal capacity, and the military must remain a place where anyone can serve, regardless of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or political beliefs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Women should be allowed to serve in the military, but not on the front lines as combatants Do you agree with the consensus view? Do you think it would have been better for the group to have come to a consensus with a different opinion?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Men and women should be allowed to serve in the military. Women have the right to serve their country in the same way that men do. In many cases, women are just as capable as men, and in some cases they are more capable. Women have proven themselves in the past and they will continue to do so in the future. The only exception to this is in the case of front line combat roles, as it is widely accepted that men are physically stronger than women. However, women can still serve in the military in a wide range of other roles.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, both men and women should be allowed to serve in the military. However, women should not be allowed to serve in the front lines as this would be unfair to men who would be required to serve in the front lines.
