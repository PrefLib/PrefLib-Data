# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Education is the most important way of getting the best from people. The high initial cost would be paid back to society ten fold.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The state should provide free, high quality, education from nursery to PhD because education is a basic human right and is also an essential part of life and a basic need that everyone should have access to.” “Without an education a person cannot get a good job and cannot have a fulfilling life. The only way to get an education is to go to school. The state should provide education to all people because it is a human right and if they don’t provide education, people will struggle to make a life for themselves.” “Education is the most important way of getting the best from people. The high initial cost would be paid back to society ten fold.” “I believe that the state should provide free education as education is a part of every person’s basic need. Every person should have the right for shelter, food and education and having to struggle for any of these basic needs is inhumane. If PHD's are free, then it will make it easier for people to study their desired subject rather than having to struggle for money. Education is the most important way of getting the best from people. The high initial cost would be paid back to society ten fold.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Free education at all levels is a right for all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Education is the most important way of getting the best from people. The high initial cost would be paid back to society ten fold. Every person should have the right for shelter, food and education and having to struggle for any of these basic needs is inhumane. If PHD's are free, then it will make it easier for people to study their desired subject rather than having to struggle for money. The state should provide this sort of high quality education from nursery to PhD because a high quality education makes for better informed people and this can only help businesses for example to succeed and be productive, this in turn generates the economy in a way that benefits everyone. Education is essential in not only ticking an economy over, but is also essential to helping a society be a more stable place, in for example governments. If people have an educated understanding of how governments work, then they will be better informed to vote in a more responsible manner. The counties future is based on good education. Everyone should be able to get free and high quality education. If we keep our children and adults busy with education, we would have less crime overall. I think that education is a human right that should be accessible to all regardless of their background. I imagine
