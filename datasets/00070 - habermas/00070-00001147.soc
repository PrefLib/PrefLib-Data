# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a higher tax rate for those earning more than £250,000 because they receive more income than those earning less.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a higher tax rate for those earning more than £250,000 because they earn more money. They also get more benefits. This was a difficult process, and we were asked to record our personal feelings after the group reached their consensus.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People earning more than £250,000 should definitely be taxed higher. The main reason for this is that the higher tax rate would increase the wealth of the poorer majority, by redistributing some of the income of the richer minority. The income tax rate is already quite high, and increasing it slightly would not be unfair, as the minority in question are already living extremely comfortably and can certainly afford to be taxed more. The extra money raised could be used for increasing public services such as education and healthcare, or for lowering the tax burden on those who earn less.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People earning more than £250,000 should be taxed at a higher rate because they are already in a very fortunate situation. Any increase in their tax rate would still enable them to live comfortably and to take home the majority of their earnings, while still paying a fair amount of tax. This is in line with the social justice principle of progressive taxation, where the more you earn, the higher your tax rate should be. Anyone making over £250,000 is already living extremely comfortably and can most certainly afford a higher tax rate that would assist in lifting up the lives of millions of workers who were born into situations that left them trapped in low-paying jobs.
