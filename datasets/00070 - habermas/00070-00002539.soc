# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, MPs should be there on merit and it is usually the same ones voted in all the time. Change can be good, and were I'm from MPs don't change all that much. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, there should be a term limit for MPs. The reason being that fresh perspective on things would often be useful. If an MP is in for too long they may lose sight of why they got elected in the first place. Also, it should not be considered a full-time job but more like a voluntary effort to serve the good of a community.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - MP's seem to have very short term nowadays such as our last prime ministers but I think that giving term limits to MP's will allow more young people to take part and give a newer view to the already, conservative parliament. This is a good thing and will create interesting and valuable policies that align more with young people views.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I do not feel particularly strongly that there should be a term limit for MPs. I would err on the side of that there shouldn't be. We are (or are supposed to be) a country which values meritocracy. Therefore, your time in a job, any job, should be based on how good you are at the job, not on how long you have been in it. I do however feel that the number of MPs in total should be reduced from it's current number of 650.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - yes there should to give others a chance to do a better job, some get complacent doing their job and think they are untouchable
