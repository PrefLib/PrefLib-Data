# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the legalization of magic mushrooms would lead to a significant decrease in crime rates in the country because of the lack of need for the importation of hard class A drugs such as cocaine and heroine. It would also be better regulated by those authorized to do so in order to ensure that it is used properly for the purposes that it was intended for. This is an important point because of the number of crime-related incidents that have been happening in the country. We have also come to the consensus that legalization of magic mushrooms is the best solution for this issue.
