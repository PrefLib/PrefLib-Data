# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a general consensus that it is not possible to eliminate nuclear weapons entirely.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Most of the participants thought that it would be difficult to fully ban nuclear weapons because some countries would not be prepared to give up their stockpiles and could not be relied on to report accurately on what they had. They felt that some countries would not support a ban because they saw nuclear weapons as a necessary deterrent against other countries who might try to attack them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the participants were in favour of a nuclear weapons ban but sceptical that it would be fully effective. They generally felt that some countries will not support a ban on nuclear weapons due to concerns for national security. They were not sure if they would ever know if all countries were being honest about their nuclear stockpiles.
