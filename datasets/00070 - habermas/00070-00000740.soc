# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Pets should not be banned.  We feel that there are many people who benefit from having a pet in their home and the banning of pets would be detrimental to their health and well-being.  We do however feel that the sale of pets should be more tightly regulated.  We feel that there should be a vetting system in place where the new owners are investigated to ensure that they are careful owners.  The owners should be given all the information that the owner needs to make the home the best place possible for the pet to live a happy life.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a vetting system in place where the new owners are investigated to ensure that they are careful owners.  This will help decrease the amount of animal abuse and provide much needed protection for both the animals and prospective pet owners as pets who come from these terrible backgrounds typically have many health problems.
