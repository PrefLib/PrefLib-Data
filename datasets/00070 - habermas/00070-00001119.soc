# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that the government should subsidize public transportation so that it's free to use. The benefits of free public transport would be that it would allow all people to have easy mobility regardless of wealth. It would also encourage better-off people to use public transport rather than their own vehicles as it would save them money, which would reduce pollution and congestion. The cost would be considerable, so a more realistic option may be to subsidise it to make it easily affordable but not free. This would have the advantage of discouraging people making unnecessary pleasure trips on public transport, reducing overcrowding.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It would be a good idea for the government to subsidise public transport, as it would enable all people to have easy mobility regardless of wealth. This would allow poor people to go out and find better jobs without the need of money to pay for transport whilst job hunting. It would also encourage better-off people to use public transport rather than their own vehicles as it would save them money, which would reduce pollution and congestion. However the downside is that the cost would be considerable, so a more realistic option may be to subsidise it to make it easily affordable but not free. This would have the advantage of discouraging people making unnecessary pleasure trips on public transport, reducing overcrowding.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group came to the consensus that the government should not subsidize public transport to make it free, but to subsidize it enough to make it affordable to the majority of people, so that everyone can use it. It would reduce pollution, increase the health of the nation, and increase access to services for the poorer members of society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of free public transport, but with some reservations. The main concern was that it would encourage people to make unnecessary journeys, which would increase pollution and congestion. It was felt that a better option would be to subsidise public transport to make it more affordable, but not free.
