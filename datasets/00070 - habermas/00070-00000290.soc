# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to banning meat in order to save the planet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, the government should not ban eating meat, but there should be greater efforts to encourage people to reduce their meat consumption.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although there is a strong case to be made that meat eating is harmful to the planet, and as such a ban should be introduced, in our view the current evidence does not support such a radical move. It would appear to us that some of the consequences of such a ban, including the risk of public disorder, would outweigh the advantages of such a move. As such, we recommend that the government use more subtle ways to try to persuade the public that meat eating is harmful.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should ban eating meat in order to save the planet. We need to take the initiative to save our planet before it is too late. There are alternatives to meat which can be encouraged and subsidised.
