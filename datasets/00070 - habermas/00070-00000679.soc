# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should introduce a maximum wage for British citizens. This will help reduce the wealth divide in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the introduction of a maximum wage for British citizens is a good idea as it would help decrease the wealth divide between the richest and the poorest and help create more equality within society. However, it is also important to increase the minimum wage in order to help those at the bottom of the ladder.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of a maximum wage for British citizens. Some felt that it would reduce inequality, some felt it would encourage more people to work in public service and some felt that it would make people happier. Some were against the idea because they felt that people should be able to work as hard as they want to get as much as they can. In the end, the group felt that a maximum wage would be a good thing, but that it would not be a simple task to introduce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should introduce a maximum wage for British citizens. A maximum wage would help reduce the wealth divide between the richest and the poorest.
