# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children under 11 should be allowed to play video games. The games should be age appropriate and in moderation. Parental guidance should be in place to ensure that the games are age appropriate and that the children are not spending too much time playing video games.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children should be allowed to play video games but only if they are age appropriate. Video games should only be played in moderation, and should not replace other activities that develop the child in other ways. Parental guidance is also essential to ensure that children are not being exposed to unsuitable content.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children under 11 should be allowed to play age appropriate games. They have age ratings for games and when selling them should be treated as if selling other age regulated items eg cigarettes. Children spend more time indoors now than ever before so should be able to be entertained.  Lots of games can also be educational and fun.  Parents should supervise their children when playing games and ensure that they are not exposed to inappropriate content.  They should not spend all their time on video games as socialising face to face is important for children's development both anatomically and socially.  The most important thing is that children are happy and safe.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children under 11 should be allowed to play video games in moderation. The way we all argued in the group was to find a common ground. We all agreed that games are not only for fun but for learning and that they do have some developmental and cognitive benefits. However we all also agreed that games should not be the only thing a child does, as it is important that they also develop social skills, play outside, read, etc. We also discussed whether the parental involvement is required and it was agreed that parents should supervise the child in case the child has not been told of the age rating, and also to make sure that the game they are playing is age appropriate. It was also agreed that children shouldn't be allowed to play games that may have an age restriction, but with a mature content such as gore, nudity, and violence. Overall, the opinion of the group was that children should be allowed to play video games but in moderation and with parental supervision.
