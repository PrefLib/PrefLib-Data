# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that funding for public art should be increased in the UK. Public art is something that has the power to make a real difference to people's lives. It can also provide a great way to make an area more attractive to tourists and visitors, thus boosting the local economy. If there is a push for this from the government, it will provide an extra impetus to local councils to invest in public art, and this will bring great benefits to the local communities. A secondary way of using consensus decision making was to ask the group to complete a task with a group goal. The participants were then asked to reflect on how they contributed to the group task. The following presents a description of the task, each participant's reflections on their own contribution to the group task, and the final group consensus on the quality of the group decision.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - After a long debate, we have all come to the conclusion that funding for public art should be increased in the UK. We recognise that times are tough at the moment, and that a lot of people feel that money would be better spent on improving infrastructure and health, but we also feel that the arts are vital for the mental health of the nation, and they are often the first thing to be cut when budgets are being reviewed. If there is a push for this from the government, it will provide an extra impetus to local councils to invest in public art, and this will bring great benefits to the local communities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be more public art in the UK. The government should encourage this by all means possible. The people of the UK deserve more beauty and expression in their lives, and it can only be a good thing for people to have more places to express themselves. If this also increases tourism to the UK and boosts the local economy, this should be seen as an added bonus. There are those who might argue that the government has bigger fish to fry. This is true to some extent, as the UK is in dire need of investment in its infrastructure, education system, health service and transport. However, there is no reason why the government cannot do both. In fact, the very existence of public art will make people happier, and happier people will tend to be healthier and less stressed. All of these factors can be seen to contribute to the success of the health service, education system and transport system. So perhaps it is the case that public art can also contribute to the infrastructure of the UK, in a more indirect way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that funding for public art should be increased in the UK. Public art is something that has the power to make a real difference to people's lives. It can also provide a great way to make an area more attractive to tourists and visitors, thus boosting the local economy. If there is a push for this from the government, it will provide an extra impetus to local councils to invest in public art, and this will bring great benefits to the local communities.
