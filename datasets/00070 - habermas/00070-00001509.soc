# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The legalisation of recreational drugs like cannabis, along with Government control and regulations, would mean that users at the bottom of the chain, whom often are addicted, poor and/or working class, would suffer less abuse from criminal groups that abuse people for their own gain. We should make the drug more accessible to the public, and use the tax revenue it would generate to tackle the negative consequences of drug use. The use of cannabis should be legal, with the same restrictions as alcohol, but with strict guidelines in place to ensure the safety of the user, such as driving or other similar activities. It is important to be cautious about the use of cannabis, as it can have adverse effects on people, such as paranoia and slower reaction times, but if used in a controlled manner it can be beneficial.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of legalising cannabis. However, there were concerns about the potential for increased use, particularly by young people. There was also a concern that cannabis is a 'gateway drug' and that legalising it would lead to increased use of other, more harmful drugs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the legalisation of recreational drugs like cannabis is a good idea. The Government could make a lot of money from taxing the sale of cannabis, and this could be used to improve the country. It would also mean that cannabis is sold in a safe way, and people would be less likely to buy cannabis from criminals. However, there are some risks. For example, if cannabis is legalised, it might make it more accessible to children, and this could have a negative impact on their health. Also, if cannabis is legalised, people might feel more comfortable driving or doing other activities while under the influence of cannabis, and this could be dangerous. Therefore, the legalisation of cannabis should be done carefully, and with strict rules in place to make sure that it is used safely.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that cannabis should be legalised. It is less harmful than other drugs that are legal, such as tobacco and alcohol. The only concern we have is that it might cause harm to people's mental health.
