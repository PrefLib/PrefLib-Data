# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should not be forced to learn a musical instrument, but rather given the option to do so. Learning a musical instrument is good for children as it helps the development of their brain, and can be used as a creative outlet for their imagination, which will hopefully increase the intelligence of the child. Along with this, it will also increase the child's quality of living as it becomes a hobby they can do in their spare time. Children should also be encouraged to play a musical instrument as it can become a great opportunity for them, as they will be able to use it to impress others, and if exceptionally talented, to use as a career path.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Children should be given the opportunity to learn to play a musical instrument, but it should not be forced on them. Learning to play a musical instrument can help develop a child's brain, more specifically the creative process behind their thinking and imagination which in turn should increase the intelligence of the child. Along with this, it should also increase quality of living, as playing a musical instrument becomes a hobby a child can do in their spare time to either perfect for enrichment, or to impress others - or even if exceptionally talented, as a future career path. Playing an instrument can only benefit a child's upbringing, so it is important we encourage them to do so. However, it is important to remember that not all children will wish to play a musical instrument, and this should not be forced upon them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should not be obliged to play a musical instrument, but we think that schools should provide children with the opportunity to play a musical instrument if they wish to.  We think that playing a musical instrument is a valuable skill and an enjoyable hobby that children can benefit from and we think that it is important to give children the opportunity to try playing an instrument.  However, we don't think that it is essential for children to play an instrument, and some children may prefer to study other subjects instead.
