# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “In general, the group was in favour of encouraging more immigration to the UK.  The main argument for this was that immigration brings a variety of benefits to the UK, such as cultural diversity, economic growth, and filling skill shortages in the workforce.  However, it was also recognised that immigration can lead to increased pressure on public services such as schools and hospitals, and may lead to increased competition for jobs and potentially driving down wages for UK citizens.  It was also recognised that these problems can often be magnified during economic downturns or when there is high unemployment among certain groups.  The group felt that the positives of immigration outweighed the negatives, but that it is important to ensure that the UK has the necessary resources in place to support immigrants.  The group also felt that immigrants should be carefully vetted prior to being allowed into the country.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We generally agree with increasing immigration to the UK.  The main argument for this is that immigration brings a variety of benefits to the UK, such as cultural diversity, economic growth, and filling skill shortages in the workforce.  However, it was also recognised that immigration can lead to increased pressure on public services such as schools and hospitals, and may lead to increased competition for jobs and potentially driving down wages for UK citizens.  It was also recognised that these problems can often be magnified during economic downturns or when there is high unemployment among certain groups.  The group felt that the positives of immigration outweighed the negatives, but that it is important to ensure that the UK has the necessary resources in place to support immigrants.  We also felt that immigration should be carefully vetted to ensure that it does not increase pressure on public services and that it should not drive down wages for UK citizens.  We also felt that it is important to address demographic challenges such as an aging population and declining birth rates especially in the younger generation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of encouraging more immigration to the UK.  The main argument for this was that immigration brings a variety of benefits to the UK, such as cultural diversity, economic growth, and filling skill shortages in the workforce.  However, it was also recognised that immigration can lead to increased pressure on public services such as schools and hospitals, and may lead to increased competition for jobs and potentially driving down wages for UK citizens.  It was also recognised that these problems can often be magnified during economic downturns or when there is high unemployment among certain groups.  The group felt that the positives of immigration outweighed the negatives, but that it is important to ensure that the UK has the necessary resources in place to support immigrants.  The group also felt that it is important to vet immigrants prior to allowing them into the country, in order to ensure that they are a suitable addition to the UK population.
