# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the world. It is also a major cause of disease and disability. Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body, causing many diseases and affecting the health of smokers in general. The prevalence of smoking in the population is a key factor in determining the health of the nation. If the prevalence of smoking in a country is high, it can be expected that the rates of disease and death due to smoking will also be high. Smoking causes a large proportion of lung cancers, and increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and a range of other conditions. Aside from the harm to the smoker, exposure to secondhand smoke is a cause of disease, including lung cancer and heart disease, in nonsmokers. While arguments might be made for protecting personal freedom, the negative effects of secondhand smoking are also strongly supported. For the sake of public health, the sale of cigarettes should be banned.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of a ban on the sale of cigarettes. However, it was felt that this should be done in a way that is fair to people who have been smoking their entire life and have a physical addiction to cigarettes. The group felt that cigarettes should be phased out, in a way that increases the minimum age of purchase each year, so the newer generation is unable to buy them. This means in about 80 years they will be made completely illegal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It was agreed that the negative health effects of tobacco smoking are well documented and unambiguous. The group also agreed that despite the general acknowledgement of the harmful effects of smoking, there is a clear ethical responsibility to protect the right of the individual to make their own decisions about their health and what they choose to do with their own body. However, a distinction was made between the health effects of smoking that only affect the smoker and those that have wider, public health implications. For example, we all have the right to harm ourselves, but we do not have the right to harm others. As such, we also agreed that in addition to the right to harm oneself, we have an ethical responsibility to others, such that people who smoke cigarettes are ethically obliged to do so only in a way that does not inflict their second hand smoke on others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe cigarettes should be banned. However, we understand that this would have a significant impact on people who are currently smoking and this should be considered. However, the increased dangers of second-hand smoke should be taken into account when considering whether to ban the sale of cigarettes.
