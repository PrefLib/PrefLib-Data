# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We think that the police should be allowed to stop and search people for drugs if they are in an area known for drug dealing. We think that it is important for the police to be able to control the crime rate and to make the country a safer place to live. However, we also think that the police should be careful to only stop people who they believe are carrying drugs and not just anyone who is in the area. We also think that people who are stopped and searched should have the right to speak to the police in private, so that no one can hear what they are saying and make assumptions about them. We also think that the police should give a good reason for stopping and searching someone, so that people do not feel that they are being unfairly targeted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We think that the police should be allowed to stop and search people for drugs if they are in an area known for drug dealing. We think that it is important for the police to be able to control the crime rate and to make the country a safer place to live. However, we also think that the police should be careful to only stop people who they believe are carrying drugs and not just anyone who is in the area. We also think that people who are stopped and searched should have the right to speak to the police in private, so that no one can hear what they are saying and make assumptions about them. Final opinion from Participant 1: I agree with the opinion that police should be allowed to stop and search people for drugs even if they are in an area known for drug dealing. This is to promote peace and order and low crime rate. However,  this power should not be abused and can be challenge by people. Final opinion from Participant 2: I broadly agree with the statement and it is aligned with my original opinion.  There could be more information about how the police would be led to believe a person was carrying drugs.  There could also be more detail of how the police have used powers of stop and search disproportionately
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group broadly agreed that police should be allowed to search people for drugs if they are in an area known for drug dealing. In order for the police to be able to effectively stop crimes being committed, they need to be able to act accordingly. Therefore, we think the police need to have a good reason to stop and search people, for example, if they look suspicious or if they have a criminal record. We think that if someone were to be stopped and searched by the police, that person should be able to talk to the police officer in private so no one can hear what they are saying. This prevents people from making assumptions about the person being stopped.  Conclusion The process of helping the participants to consider multiple viewpoints has been effective. Those who used to be somewhat intolerant to views which were contrary to their own have started to realise that by considering views of others, they can deepen their understanding of the issue. I have found the majority of participants believe the most effective way to reach a consensus is by effectively debating. By giving them a chance to consider multiple viewpoints in a safe space, I have seen that the participants gained more confidence in expressing their opinions and also learned to challenge those who hold contrary views
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We think that the police should be allowed to stop and search people for drugs if they are in an area known for drug dealing. We think that it is important for the police to be able to control the crime rate and to make the country a safer place to live. However, we also think that the police should be careful to only stop people who they believe are carrying drugs and not just anyone who is in the area. We also think that people who are stopped and searched should have the right to speak to the police in private, so that no one can hear what they are saying and make assumptions about them.  We think that the police should make sure they have good reasons for stopping certain types of people and do not stop and search people just because they come from different backgrounds to themselves.
