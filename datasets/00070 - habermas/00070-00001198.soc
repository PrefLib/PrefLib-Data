# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We agree that the judicial system should be overseen by humans, but we also feel that there is a lot of potential for AI to be used as a tool to assist human decision-making. We feel that it would be unethical to use AI to make judicial decisions in isolation because humans would be able to understand the nuances of a case better than a machine. We feel that in the future, AI will become more intelligent and will become a very useful tool in the judicial system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that while AI is not ready for judicial decision making, it is ready to be a useful tool to help humans make such decisions. AI will eventually be able to read body language, assess the truthfulness of a person, and determine their intent. It may also be possible for humans to find ways to hide the truthfulness of their statements. This is why we believe that humans must be in control of the decision-making process.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is not ethical to use AI in the judicial system currently. AI is incapable of reading body language, assessing the truthfulness of a person, or determining intent. It cannot understand contextual information. We do not believe that AI will ever be capable of being able to fulfil these vital requirements. Humans are far more capable of picking up on contextual information and other minute details than AI will ever be. However, we do believe that AI can be useful in assisting humans in making important decisions about the judicial process. These decisions are far too important to be left up to AI. We believe that with the current limitations of AI, it is not appropriate to use in the judicial system. However, we are very excited about the potential of AI in the future and we believe that it could eventually be a useful tool to the judicial system, but humans must be in control of the decision-making process.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that it is not ethical to use AI in the judicial system. The main reason for this is that AI is not yet capable of reading body language, assessing the truthfulness of a person, or determining their intent. Humans are also much more likely to be able to comprehend contextual information which is important in any court case. We believe that there is a lot of potential for AI to assist humans in making judgements, but we feel that humans must be in control of the decision-making process. This is a developing area and we are confident that as the AI continues to improve and develop, it will become a useful tool in this sector.
