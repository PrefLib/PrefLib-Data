# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of allowing people in the UK to carry non-lethal weapons for self-defence. However, the group was of the opinion that it is important to know what those non-lethal weapons are, and whether they will cause a great deal of harm. The group was also of the opinion that people should be allowed to carry non-lethal weapons for self-defence, but only if those weapons will not cause a great deal of harm and are used solely for self-defence. The group also believed that police should have better weapons though as they are properly trained.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People in the UK should be allowed to carry non-lethal weapons for self-defence. This is the case because in today's society people need protection. The rate of crime is on the rise and so police can't be everywhere.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of allowing people to carry non-lethal weapons for self-defence. This would be particularly beneficial to women who are often victims of violence. In order to ensure that those weapons are not misused, they would need to be non-lethal. Anyone wishing to carry such weapons would also need to demonstrate a certain level of competency in their use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, people should not be allowed to carry non-lethal weapons for self-defence. This is because there is a possibility that these weapons could be used in a criminal way, and also because the police should be the ones who are responsible for people's safety and security. However, it is important to note that the police should be better equipped to deal with crime, and they should be able to protect law-abiding citizens.
