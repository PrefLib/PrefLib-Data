# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Though a tax on sugary food would increase the cost of unhealthy eating, it would disproportionately affect low-income earners who mostly rely on these types of food because they are more affordable. A tax on sugary food could also have some unintended consequences, such as less regulation and control on unhealthy eating. Therefore, we believe that there should be a focus on encouraging healthy eating in other ways, such as through education about healthy diets in schools, and by making healthier food more affordable and accessible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Though we should encourage healthier eating, we do not think that a sugar tax is the way to do it. The tax would more likely not be invested into the right areas and would disproportionately affect low-income earners who mostly rely on these types of food because they are more affordable. We believe that other ways to encourage healthy eating should be looked into. A possible solution would be to use the money from a sugar tax to lower the prices of healthy foods so that they are more affordable to all income earners.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While we should encourage healthier eating, we do not think that a sugar tax is the way to do it. The tax would more likely not be invested into the right areas and would disproportionately affect low-income earners who mostly rely on these types of food because they are more affordable. We believe that other ways to encourage healthy eating should be looked into. These include the government subsidizing fresh produce and providing people with vouchers to spend on these foods to ensure they have equal access to it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While we should encourage healthier eating, we do not think that a sugar tax is the way to do it. The tax would more likely not be invested into the right areas and would disproportionately affect low-income earners who mostly rely on these types of food because they are more affordable. We believe that other ways to encourage healthy eating should be looked into. This is because a sugar tax would have too many side-effects, for example it would mean that people who cannot afford to pay more for their food will buy even less healthy food. We should come up with other ways to encourage healthier eating as a sugar tax would not solve the main problem.
