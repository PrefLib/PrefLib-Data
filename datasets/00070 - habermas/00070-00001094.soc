# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of holding corporations liable for the crimes committed by their directors and employees. The group felt that this would act as a deterrent to crime and would also ensure that justice was served. The group felt that it was important to hold individuals accountable for their actions, regardless of their status. The group also felt that corporations should be held liable for the crimes committed by their directors and employees as this would help to promote a culture of ethical behaviour within the organization.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While it is important for individuals who commit crimes to be held accountable regardless of their status, the question of whether it is appropriate to allow corporations to be liable for the crimes committed by their directors and employees is a complex and debatable issue. The importance of understanding the scope of employment must be highlighted. Crimes committed solely within the personal sphere of directors and employees must not be the responsibility of the corporation. But, crimes committed within their employment as a result of their access to information, ability to coerce and influence, or physical access to people or property, must be considered the responsibility of their employer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is appropriate to allow corporations to be liable for the crimes committed by their directors and employees. The individuals who committed the crimes should be held liable, as well as their employers. This will deter future crimes by making corporations more aware of their employees’ actions, and provide victims with more options for justice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Corporations should be held liable for the crimes committed by their directors and employees. This is because it will encourage corporations to be more diligent in their hiring process and will also promote a culture of ethical behaviour within the organization. This will ensure that justice is served and that victims are provided with resources. This will also act as a deterrent for other corporations.
