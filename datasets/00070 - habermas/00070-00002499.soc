# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I think it is a good idea for children to learn a second language for a few reasons.  Firstly, we are part of a global community and learning another language can break down barriers, enhance travel and job opportunities.  Secondly, it gives you an insight into another culture and their priorities and values.  Lastly, it can also help you to understand your own language, its structures and systems better.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I think it is beneficial for the children to learn a second language as it encourages them to use different parts of the brain. Although i think they should learn this, i dont think it should be compulsory after year 9 and children should be able to chose subjects which interest them as i believe they will perform better. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I think it is beneficial for children to learn a second language and can present a great opportunity for learning, but I don't think it should be *required* for a child to learn a second language. Energy should be spent first ensuring children have desirable literacy skills in their first language that will set them up for the rest of their lives. While it's true that children are like sponges and pick up languages very easily, it feels like a big ask when we already know English literacy levels in the UK are low and children starting secondary school are often below where they should be with reading and writing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think that learning a second language will have benefits for children throughout their life. They have to spend their time learning a range of subjects, and I think a second language is at least as useful if not more useful than many of the other subjects they might study. It may also enrich their culture and enhance travel, and enable them to undertake job opportunities that they otherwise would not have been eligible to appy for. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I have two children who are both learning French at Primary school. I love the fact they are learning another language, it broadens their knowledge of other countries and helps them to learn that not everyone is the same.
