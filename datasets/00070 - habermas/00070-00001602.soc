# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Humans will probably be able to communicate with animals, at some point, in the future, but how this will happen is currently unknown.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is highly likely that humans will gain the ability to communicate with animals, given that research and advances in AI and machine learning continue to progress at a rapid rate. We will be able to communicate more fully with animals but we may not understand their language as they would not have the cognitive ability to learn ours. However, humans will be able to understand animal communications in a similar way to how we can currently interpret body language. Humans will learn to communicate with animals that have a high level of intelligence. In the near future, it is likely that this will be dolphins, whales and octopuses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Humans will be able to communicate with animals in the future, but it will be a long time before this is achieved.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Humans will learn to communicate with animals. It is already happening in some ways and will continue to improve. Humans will be able to understand animals and have conversations with them. The first animals we will learn to communicate with will be intelligent animals such as octopuses. Humans will learn to speak the animal language rather than animals speaking human languages. This will happen far into the future as the technology is not there yet. This will happen as there is value and benefit in communicating with animals. It is a fun and interesting thing and has commercial value.
