# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Single-use plastic packaging should be banned when there are other alternative methods of packaging which don't create the same amount of waste.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Most of the group thought that in general single-use packaging should be banned, but some packaging, such as meat packaging, can be essential. We believe that there should be a study into finding eco-friendly packaging which serves the same purpose as the single-use packaging currently in use, and the single-use packaging should be banned as soon as the eco-friendly packaging is ready.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group, in general, was in favour of banning single-use packaging but we all had different opinions on which single-use packaging should be banned and which should not. For example, one person thought that meat packaging shouldn't be banned, because it increases shelf-life and helps to keep the price of meat low. Others believed that it should be banned as it's harmful to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a ban on single-use packaging. However, there should be exemptions for packaging that keeps prices low and increases shelf-life.
