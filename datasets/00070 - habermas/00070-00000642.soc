# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of allowing the Chinese state to invest in our high speed rail network. The idea was seen as being too risky, as the Chinese government is known to be a dictatorship and their investment would likely be motivated by their own benefit, rather than the benefit of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of Chinese investment in our railways. The main reason for this was the fact that we are not sure what the Chinese's motivation would be for investing in the railways. It was felt that the Chinese could use this investment to exert control over the UK. This would be very dangerous.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the Chinese state is not a trusted ally and there would be questions about their motivations for investing in the UK. Therefore, we should not allow them to invest in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to Chinese investment in the British railway system. The Chinese state has a poor human rights record and is not to be trusted. Therefore, we should not allow the Chinese to invest in our railway.
