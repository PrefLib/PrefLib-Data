# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In time, we will be able to make computers that think like humans. We already have developing AI systems that are incredibly human like and providing a huge insight in the times to come. As computers will be developed by humans this allows human input to be installed into them, and then software and machinery to be developed further on this basis. We will struggle to recreate human-like thinking in the emotional rollercoaster often witnessed in the human thought process. For example, we will surely not recreate the impact which fear creates in the human conscious. We surely therefore can not represent the role anger plays in making an action, and then subsequently regretting and trying to repent for said action. Computers may mathematically come close to thinking like humans but I do not believe that the twists and turns of human thought patterns can be recreated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In time, we will be able to make computers that think like humans. The fact that computers are being developed by humans means that human input can be installed into them, and then software and machinery can be developed further on this basis. While there are common patterns in thought amongst humans, nearly everyone thinks differently and this is influenced by the things we experience every day. Our thinking is also influenced heavily by our emotions, so for a computer to think like a human, would mean teaching a computer to feel or emulate emotion to some degree. But even then, we have to consider, is the computer really thinking like a human, or is it just emulating how humans behave.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In time, yes, we will be able to make computers that think like humans. We will not be able to make computers that think exactly like humans, as each person is different and we are not able to recreate human emotions. However, as computers are developed by humans, human input will be installed into them. This will allow software and machinery to be developed further on this basis. We will get very close to making it look like a computer can think.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In time, it is likely that computers will be able to think like humans. The process of thinking is very complex and involves a number of different processes, some of which we are yet to fully understand. We are currently at a stage where computers can think in a very similar way to humans, but we are not yet at the stage where they can think exactly like humans. This is because computers do not have the ability to feel or emulate emotion. This means that they are unable to make decisions based on their emotions, or to experience the same level of emotion that a human would experience. This is a very important part of the human thought process and is something that computers are not yet able to replicate. However, it is likely that in time computers will be able to think like humans, and this is something that we are working towards.
