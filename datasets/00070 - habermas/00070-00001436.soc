# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is important for the government to subsidise the arts in order to allow for full and equal access to all groups and members of society. It also enhances the cultural, social and economic well being of society. However, we believe the amount of government subsidies should be kept to a minimum and that the funds allocated to the arts should be prioritised over other expenditures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should subsidise the arts to a limited extent.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should more heavily subsidise the arts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the government should not subsidise the arts.  In my opinion this should be left to market forces to fund art endeavours.  Funding through education is sufficient in my opinion.  There are far more pressing  needs for government funding.  At this stage in my country, arts funding is a luxury we cannot afford.  However, the government should subsidise the arts, but only to a limited extent.  I believe that the arts are important, but there are higher priorities elsewhere.  For example, it's difficult to appreciate the arts if you are hungry due to being unable to afford food, or in pain as a result on being unable to get adequate healthcare, or if you've just been robbed due to there not being enough police on the streets.  Nevertheless, it is the job of the government to allocate a reasonable level of funding for the arts as not all art can exist as a commercial business.  It is important to subsides the arts to ensure access to all groups and members of society.  It also enhances the cultural, social and economic well being of society.
