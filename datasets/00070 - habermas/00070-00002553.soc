# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I believe that we should lower the voting age to 16. This is because it would encourage young people to get more involved in politics at an earlier point in their lives. By 16, you are pretty much seen as an adult already. For example, you can have a job and have children, but you are unable to have a say on how the country is ran and how it can support you. By 16, most young people have a sufficient understanding of the issues facing them and they should have the opportunity to voice those to make the country better for all. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I do believe that the voting age should be reduced to 16. Whilst many young people at this age may be misinformed or perhaps immature in their views, I believe that there are also those that are passionate about their country, politics, and their futures. I believe that these people deserve a voice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I don't care much about this topic, but I do think it's unnecessary to lower the voting age. Although it's only two years, I think the life experience and knowledge most gain between the ages of 16 and 18 is significant enough to avoid lowering the voting age.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I am not quite sure that we should lower the voting age from 18 to 16. I do not feel as if the brains of the age group in question will have fully developed yet,  however every person is different in the way they think and absorb information. It could encourage adolescents to research further by giving them a sense of responsibility, on the other hand it could deter some from participating.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - No way! They are still children at 16 and have no idea how the country is run. They cannot possibly have an understanding on the bigger picture and have no life experiences to base their vote on.
