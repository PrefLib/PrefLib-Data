# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The problem of childhood obesity and associated health problems in the UK cannot be solved by simply banning the sale of large fizzy drinks. However, this has been used as an example, as many young people consume them regularly and they are known to be a factor. Instead, we believe that a more effective approach would be to introduce measures to raise awareness of the problems caused by fizzy drinks, including information on their calorific value. In addition, we believe that some steps could be taken to make them less accessible to young people. It was also agreed that other options should be considered, such as taxing the manufacturers or increasing the price. It is hoped that a combination of all of these measures would bring about an improvement in the health of the nation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There was agreement that the negative health effects caused by fizzy drinks are more significant than the benefits they provide. It was agreed that this is a huge issue as a lot of young people consume them regularly. However, we do not believe that banning them outright would be the most effective way of dealing with the problem. Instead, we believe that a more effective approach would be to introduce measures to raise awareness of the problems caused by fizzy drinks, including information on their calorific value. In addition, we believe that some steps could be taken to make them less accessible to young people. It was also agreed that other options should be considered, such as taxing the manufacturers or increasing the price.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a sugar tax on fizzy drinks. This would increase the price and deter people from buying them, especially children. The tax should be used to fund increased education around sugar consumption. The price increase would also increase the price of the drinks and lead to a decrease in sales, which would be beneficial to the health of the nation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It was agreed that fizzy drinks do cause more health problems than they provide any benefit. We also agreed that, in particular, young people consume a significant amount of fizzy drinks. The consensus view was that we would prefer not to outright ban fizzy drinks, because we do not think that the would be the most effective measure. Instead we believe that some steps should be taken to make fizzy drinks less accessible to young people, and that a more effective approach would be to introduce measures to raise awareness of the problems caused by fizzy drinks, including their calorific value. Some people also suggested that other options, such as taxing the manufacturers or increasing the price, could be considered.
