# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a ban on all single-use plastic bags, and a tax on all other plastic bags. This is because single-use plastic bags are the worst offenders for environmental pollution, but plastic bags are still useful for certain tasks, and so it would be unfair to ban them completely. A tax on all other plastic bags would hopefully encourage people to use reusable bags, which would help reduce the amount of plastic bags that end up in landfill.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of banning plastic bags. They all thought that it was important to consider the negative impact of plastic bags on the environment, and that it was important to protect marine life. They all agreed that a ban on plastic bags would be an important step in protecting the environment. However, they also all agreed that there should be some exceptions to the ban, such as plastic bags for food hygiene purposes. The group also thought that banning plastic bags would help people become more aware of their use of plastics, and that this would help them make other changes in their lives to reduce their plastic consumption.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the UK should ban single-use plastic bags and charge for the use of others.  This is because the issue of plastic bags is only a small issue in comparison to other environmental issues such as global warming and should not be a top priority.  However, the issue of plastic bags is still a very important one as it has been proven that plastic bags have been found in the stomachs of deep sea animals and this is unacceptable.  It is also important to note that the current state of climate change means we cannot afford to make things worse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, the UK should ban all single-use plastic bags in supermarkets and shops. There should be an incentive to buy multi-use bags which can be reused and are more durable. Plastic bags are one of the most common forms of litter and the majority of them are single-use. We have seen the effects of plastic pollution on the ocean and it is clear that this is a problem which needs to be solved. We have also seen the effects of plastic pollution on marine life and it is clear that this is a problem which needs to be solved. Banning single-use plastic bags is a step in the right direction and it is something which we can do to help the planet.
