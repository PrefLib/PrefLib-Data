# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While it is our belief that a person who has been convicted of a crime should be punished for their wrong doing, we also believe that people should be given a second chance. We believe that each case should be looked at on an individual basis, and the employers should look at the crime the person has committed and decide if they will be an asset to the company or not. However, we also believe that people should be aware of their past actions and if the employer believes that the person has not changed their ways and is still a threat to the company or the public then they should be able to fire the person from their job.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the employer should have the right to fire employees who have been convicted of a crime. The employer should take into account the severity of the crime and the circumstances surrounding it. The employer should also take into account how the employee has changed since the crime and how they have served their sentence. The employer should also consider how the other employees feel about the convicted employee and whether they feel safe working with them.

For example, if the crime is very minor, then they should not be fired, but if it is a major crime, then they should be.

This debate simulation was intended to mirror a real life debate on a current social issue. In this debate simulation, the participants were given the task of coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. They were asked to individually write down their opinion on the question. They were then asked to come together as a group and discuss the question in order to reach a consensus. In the case of the participants, they all began the debate with a different opinion on the question. After much discussion, they all came to a consensus opinion. This shows that reaching a consensus can be possible even with people who may be stubborn and set in their views. It is the goal of the debate to reach a consensus, and the most important thing to take away from this is that one must be open minded and flexible. When you are
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Employers should be able to fire employees who have been convicted of a crime. However, this should be dependent on the severity of the crime, and if it is a risk to the safety of the public.
