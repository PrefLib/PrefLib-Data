# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion as to whether the use of marijuana by non-medical users is beneficial. In general, people should be free to make their own decisions on what they do with their own bodies, as long as their choices don't have a negative impact on other people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should be free to make their own decisions on what they do with their own bodies, as long as their choices don't have a negative impact on other people. There is a lot of stigma and misinformation around marijuana, which would be reduced if it were legalized. This statement makes the assumption that the current prohibition on marijuana is an appropriate way to minimise the negative impact on other people. However, the current criminal market in marijuana, and the associated criminality, is not only an attack on personal liberty, but arguably has a greater negative impact on other people than the drug itself would.  This statement also does not address the question of whether marijuana is beneficial or not. Conclusion I believe that this experience clearly demonstrated that a consensus opinion can be reached, even on a controversial topic. After the various comments, and the debate that followed, I was very surprised that the group actually reached a final consensus opinion on this question, considering the very diverse views in the group.  The level of interest and participation was great, and everyone really enjoyed the exercise. The various views, and the subsequent debate, resulted in some excellent points being raised, and a more enlightened and informed view.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Broadly, no. While there are some health concerns (especially around smoking), it's known that it's much less harmful than drinking alcohol, the other widely used drug. Many artists and creative people use marijuana, and have done throughout history, and its influence on art, literature and music is clear.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Marijuana use is not something to be encouraged, but is not inherently bad. We should focus on preventing young people from starting to use it, as it is a gateway drug. Marijuana should be legalized and tightly regulated, to eliminate the need for dealing with criminals.
