# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group have come to the consensus view that we should not introduce a wealth tax because we don't know enough about it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, the UK should definitely introduce a wealth tax. A wealth tax is necessary to ensure a more equal society can flourish. As the richest mount up their wealth and get richer, the poorest continue to toil in misery and are trapped in a poverty cycle they did not choose for themselves. The money from a wealth tax in the UK could be used to assist underfunded public sectors such as the NHS. It is abysmal that the UK is one of the highest places in the world in terms of wealth inequality.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of introducing a wealth tax in the UK. However, it was also recognised that there are a number of issues with wealth tax, such as the difficulty in valuing certain assets and the potential for wealthy individuals to move their assets abroad to avoid the tax. The group therefore suggested that the introduction of a wealth tax should be accompanied by a number of other policies, such as the introduction of a universal basic income and the introduction of a mansion tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should introduce a wealth tax. A wealth tax is necessary to ensure a more equal society can flourish. As the richest mount up their wealth and get richer, the poorest continue to toil in misery and are trapped in a poverty cycle they did not choose for themselves. The money from a wealth tax in the UK could be used to assist underfunded public sectors such as the NHS. It is abysmal that the UK is one of the highest places in the world in terms of wealth inequality. A wealth tax set at a sensible rate would barely make a difference to the lives of the incredibly rich people that would be effected by it, but make a huge difference to the rest of society as it could fund programs to benefit the poorest and most vulnerable. There are no real downsides.
