# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group of participants was opposed to the idea of letting the private sector compete against the NHS for the provision of medical care. The main reason for this was that it would create a two-tier system in which those who could afford private healthcare would be able to jump the queue and receive treatment before those who could not afford it. The NHS is a vital part of the UK and should be protected. However, it was also recognised that there are some areas in which private healthcare could be beneficial, for example in the provision of non-essential treatments such as cosmetic surgery.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, we were against the idea of letting the private sector compete against the NHS for the provision of medical care, mainly because this would create a two-tier system and move away from the principle of equal access to healthcare for all. The NHS is an essential part of the UK and one that should be protected. However, there are some areas in which private healthcare could be beneficial, for example in the provision of non-essential treatments such as cosmetic surgery.
