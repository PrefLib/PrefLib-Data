# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although we don't agree with a total ban on advertising to children under the age of 18, we feel that some adverts should be banned. We think that adverts that contain explicit sexual content or adverts for alcohol or gambling should be banned for children under the age of 18. However, we think that it is important for children to be exposed to advertising, as it helps them develop their critical thinking skills and it is also important for businesses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children should be exposed to a certain level of advertising. The level of advertising they are exposed to should be dependent on their age. There should be a gradual increase in the level of advertising they are exposed to as they get older. Advertising that is age inappropriate should be banned. Advertising that is age appropriate but has the potential to be harmful should be closely monitored and regulated. Advertising that is age appropriate and has the potential to be beneficial should be encouraged.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although children under the age of 18 are certainly easily influenced, and some contents should not reach minors, all kinds of advertising should not be banned for them. At the end of the day, youngsters must create their own perspectives and opinions to grow and improve their critical thinking. These children should have the opportunity to receive information and decide what to do with it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We feel that there should be an element of restriction when it comes to what advertising is allowed to be shown to children under the age of 18. At the same time, we think that there is some valuable information that children can learn from ads, and some advertisements can help improve their way of life. We believe that it is important to let them know about healthy food, living a healthy lifestyle, having a healthy mindset and so on. We believe that all these elements are extremely important, but at the same time we are aware of the negative effects of ads as well. Children should be allowed to develop their own view of the world, so we don't think it is fair to remove the entire influence of ads. Our view is that we should allow some ads, but the content of those ads should be closely monitored.
