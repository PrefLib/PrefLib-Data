# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The House of Lords should be abolished. It does not have the same powers as the House of Commons. In order to be a member of the House of Lords, you are not elected. In our opinion, if you are in a position of power, then you should be elected, not selected. A noble title is obtained through birth or inheritance. It is therefore, based on privilege, which means the House of Lords is a classist organisation. If we are to be equal in society, then the same rules should apply for everyone. For example, in order to obtain a job, you need to apply and be interviewed. We believe that the House of Lords should follow the same procedure. The House of Lords is not the right way forward for our future society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The House of Lords should be reformed, but not abolished. We believe that the Lords do have an important role to play in our society, but we do think that the way in which people become Lords needs to be changed. We believe that the Lords should be elected, and that the Lords should be made up of people from all walks of life, not just those who are born into the position. We believe that Lords should be elected, but that they should not be allowed to vote on every issue. We believe that the Lords should be allowed to vote on certain issues, for example on issues that are not necessarily party political, such as animal welfare. We believe that the Lords should be allowed to vote on issues that affect all people in society, for example the NHS. We believe that the Lords should not be allowed to vote on party political issues, for example the budget.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The House of Lords should be abolished. It is a relic of the past and is not in keeping with the modern world. It is undemocratic and is anachronistic. It is also not representative of the people of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The House of Lords should be reformed and strengthened rather than abolished. It is a valuable asset in the British constitution, acting as a safety net against the power of the government and acting as a legislative counterbalance. The election of members of the House of Lords should be made more meritocratic, rather than based on inheritance, so as to avoid accusations of it being an undemocratic institution. The House of Lords is a good thing and a valuable asset in the British constitution. It is an important check on the government and should be reformed, rather than abolished.
