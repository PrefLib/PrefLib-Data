# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the right to die should be allowed in more countries. It is a very sensitive topic and there are many different opinions and beliefs that could be affected. It would be beneficial to allow the right to die in more countries as it would give people the option to choose whether they want to live or die. It would also help to reduce the world population as it would decrease the amount of people in the world. The right to die should only be allowed in extreme circumstances such as terminal illnesses or severe conditions. It should be allowed if the person has the mental capacity to make the decision and if it is the best course of action. It would also be beneficial to have checks and balances in place to ensure that it is the best course of action. It is important to have a balance between allowing the right to die and protecting people who may be vulnerable and may not be making the decision themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, the right to die if you wish should be allowed if there is a good reason and after a thorough evaluation. However, this should only be allowed in certain cases where the person in question is either severely ill or is experiencing severe pain and is determined to be at a point where death would be the best outcome for their quality of life. It is hard to know what this would be but it would be an option. People should not be allowed to die if they have a mental illness as they may be unaware of their mental state and this would not be a true decision. Overall we feel that yes people should have the right to die if they wish but there should be some careful considerations for this right to be granted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People have the right to die if they wish if they are terminally ill or have extreme circumstances. They should be able to choose and if it is their wish, they should be able to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the right to die. However, the group felt that this right should be restricted to people who are terminally ill or in severe pain and suffering. The group felt that it was important to have checks in place to ensure that the person is of sound mind and that they are not being coerced into this decision. The group felt that this would be an important safeguard to ensure that the person is making the decision of their own free will.
