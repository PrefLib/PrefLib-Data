# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Climate change does pose a threat to the UK. We need to be more self-sufficient and more robust to the impacts of climate change as other countries are suffering increasingly. Our landscape, economy and way of life are at risk from floods, wildfires and drought. As a nation, we should be prepared for these events, mitigate against their worst effects and do what we can to help other countries that suffer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Climate change poses a threat to the UK. It's hard to say what effect it will have, however there are already several indications of changes due to climate change:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Climate change is the biggest threat to the UK and the world, because we rely so heavily on our planet for food, clean water and air. Climate change will cause a shortage in food and will mean that we will have to rely on importing more food which will increase our prices and the quality of food may be of a lower standard. It will also cause the sea levels to rise and floods to occur more frequently, this will mean that there will be more coastal erosion, people will have to be relocated to safer areas and some areas may not be suitable to live in anymore. This will have a knock-on effect because people will have to move to different places and these areas will have to adapt to the new changes and this will cause issues to occur.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Climate change does pose a threat to the UK. For example, extreme weather conditions like heatwaves will cause animals to struggle to survive and even lead to extinctions. Rivers will overflow and cause flooding, leading to damage to property and the spread of disease. Coastal erosion will also occur due to rising sea levels, threatening the coastal areas of the UK.
