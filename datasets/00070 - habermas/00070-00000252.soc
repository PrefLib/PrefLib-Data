# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the use of propaganda is not acceptable to shape public opinion. We believe that by the government doing this they are taking advantage of their position and manipulating the public's opinion on things. This could cause the public to have a negative view of the government and the public's trust in the government could be ruined. We also believe that by the government using propaganda the public may not be getting the full truth and what the government are actually saying and may not be the whole story. We have all agreed that the use of propaganda should not be allowed and should be looked into further as it could affect the trust in the government. Summary of the consensual research methods: The consensual research methods for the issue of the use of propaganda by the government are as follows: 1. Using a group of participants from different cultural and social backgrounds, with a mix of ages and gender. 2. Giving participants a question to discuss and answer together. 3. Allowing all participants to give their opinions and views on the question. 4.

We have all agreed that the use of propaganda should not be allowed and should be looked into further as it could affect the trust in the government. It is essential that the government are transparent with what they are saying to avoid the public from being misled and further problems.  Part 2: The App After the success of the 'My View' App which allowed people to respond to polls and express their views in the form of polls, an App called 'Your View' has been created which allows the same people to participate in a 'consensus decision-making' style system. People can still participate by responding to polls, but now they can view the responses of others, and have the opportunity to express whether
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: After a long debate we have agreed that we do not believe that the government should use propaganda to shape public opinion. We believe that this is not an acceptable practice by the government and we feel that this is unfair to the public. We believe that this would also lead to a lack of trust in the government as the public would be unable to distinguish the lies from the truth. We feel that this would cause a divide between the public and the government as the public would be unable to trust the government if they felt that they were being lied to.
