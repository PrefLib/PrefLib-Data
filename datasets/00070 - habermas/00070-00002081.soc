# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We think that in the short term, allowing more immigration to the UK will help boost our economy. In the long term we are concerned that immigrants will have an adverse effect on our economy. In order to avoid this, we propose a long term plan that will benefit both immigrants and the UK economy. We propose that immigrants are only allowed to work in the UK if they meet a certain criteria, which includes having a skill or trade which is useful to our economy, and they are paid a living wage so that they are not a burden on the economy and public services. We also propose that an organisation be set up which helps immigrants integrate and settle into their new lives. This could be something like the citizenship classes that are compulsory for immigrants in Australia, which also allow them to start learning English and be given some basic knowledge of UK laws, values and culture.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing more immigration to boost the economy. The group felt that immigration is good for the economy, as it helps businesses to grow and thrive, and it is also good for the UK as it helps us to become a more multicultural society. The group did not feel that there should be a cap on the number of immigrants that are allowed into the UK. However, the group did feel that there should be a system in place to ensure that immigrants are not a burden on the UK economy and that they have the skills and financial means to support themselves. The group felt that immigrants should be encouraged to learn the English language and to integrate into UK society. The group also felt that the current immigration system is too complicated and that it should be simplified.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of immigration. The group felt that it was important to have skilled workers in the UK and that immigration is an important part of the economy. The group felt that immigration should be encouraged but that there should be a system in place to ensure that immigrants are not a burden on the economy. The group felt that there should be a points system in place to ensure that only skilled workers are allowed to immigrate. The group also felt that there should be a system in place to help immigrants integrate into society and that there should be provisions in place to help them learn the language and access education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that immigrants can be a great asset to our country and can provide us with access to more human resources, more knowledge and help us to boost our economy. However, we feel that there should be strict guidelines for immigration into the UK to ensure that people who immigrate here are able to provide the skills that the UK needs.
