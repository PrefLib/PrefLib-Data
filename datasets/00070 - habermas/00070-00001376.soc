# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Banning fast food chains from operating near schools is a flawed policy. While the unhealthy effects of fast food are well-known, there are significant flaws in a policy which would seek to ban fast food chains from operating near schools. While banning fast food chains from operating near schools would likely have a beneficial short-term affect, in the long term we believe that this change isn't enough (it's not overarching enough and children who are determined to eat fast food would just go out of their way to find it) and secondly that it's an unnecessary overstep which inconveniences others who aren't school pupils. This change isn't enough because it doesn't directly address the source of the issue - childhood obesity - which needs to be solved through factors like education instead of punitive and regressive interventionist measures like taxes and availability that serve to impede healthy consenting adults too. We must remember that the onus is not on policy to provide children with what is best for them, but rather on parents. A responsible parent would educate their child on the health risks associated with fast food and do their best to avoid it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children should be educated by parents about the harmful effects of fast food and where possible the school should assist in the education process, however this should not come at the expense of parents and children who do not wish to change their diet. Fast food chains should not be banned from operating near schools because this would be an overreach which inconveniences other members of the community. Fast food chains near schools should be encouraged to offer healthy options on their menu.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Policy which seeks to ban fast food chains from operating near schools is flawed. Banning fast food chains from operating near schools is not likely to have the desired effect as the majority of children will continue to access it via different means, namely travelling further or from home. This is because fast food chains are available throughout the country in many outlets, an abundance of home dining options exist, and fast food is a cheap alternative to healthy diets. Banning fast food chains from operating near schools is an unnecessary overreach and limits freedom of choice for those who aren't children. We need to educate children on the importance of healthy eating, which has been proven to have many more benefits beyond weight management. Conclusion I believe that this experience makes a good case for the importance of the consensus experience in online discussion forums. By engaging in the asynchronous active consensus discussion with critical examination of viewpoints, participants are able to open up their mind to alternative views. Participants who are committed enough to engage in the active consensus process and spend time writing critiques, and ultimately revise their own views are far more likely to think critically about the experience, and therefore learn more from the process than participants who just have their own viewpoints presented to
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Final consensus statement: Proximity is a contentious issue with regards to fast food bans near schools, however it should be considered as only one factor amongst many that cause childhood obesity and not the single solution as some policies may imply. In addition, there is an overreach with attempts to ban fast food chains near schools. Rather than ban fast food chains near schools, there should be a push to provide fast food with healthy options and ensure food provided within schools is healthy. Children should be educated about the health risks associated with fast food, however children will also need to be educated about the health risks of foods commonly served at home. We believe that if a child is obese, there are causes that are unlikely to be solely in their control. We would encourage and congratulate policies that seek to reduce the addictive appeal of fast food, alongside a firm push towards healthy lifestyles and education.
