# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we should not build HS2 because it is a blight to the landscape and is harmful to the environment.  Wildlife will be greatly affected.  It offers to reduce travel time from London to Birmingham by 20 minutes, which seems largely unimpressive.  The work is cutting through large areas of previously attractive Midlands countryside and replacing it with much less attractive train line.  The cost is in the billions and I believe the benefits to the UK have been exaggerated.  It is also wrong to build such an expensive transport system when there are much more urgent needs to be addressed in the UK.
