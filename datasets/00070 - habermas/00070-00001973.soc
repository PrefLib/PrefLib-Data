# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We agree that the house of lords should be made up of a mixture of elected and appointed members. We think that the more experienced members should be appointed by the current prime minister and those with less experience should be elected. This will ensure that the house of lords is not dominated by any one particular political view, but also that the public are represented in Parliament by a cross-section of the population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While it is an important part of the House of Lords that they are not subject to party political propaganda, this means that it is difficult to justify their role as an elected body. We do believe that certain seats should be elected by the public however. This will ensure that a cross-section of the population has a voice in Parliament and that it does not appear too elitist or distant from the public. This is not to say that the members of the House of Lords are not of an elite status. Rather, it is to say that we do not believe that they should be entirely appointed based on their birth or monetary status, but rather that the public should have some say in the matter. This will also encourage a more diverse range of opinion in the House of Lords and ensure that the political views of the Lords more closely reflect those of the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While it is extremely important that the House of Lords are not subject to the rumblings and propaganda of party politics, this does not mean that their roles as un-elected seats are entirely justifiable. However, we do not think that it is unreasonable to suggest that "certain seats" should be selected to be the public's choice. This means that they will have the popular vote behind them. In this way they will also not "appear" too elitist or too far from the people.
