# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that in general, parents have the right to know the religion of their child's teachers. In order to be able to properly communicate with them, and so as to ensure that the religious views of their child's teachers are similar to their own, it is beneficial for parents to know the religious views of the teachers who are instructing their children. However, if the teachers religion will not have an effect on their teaching of their child, we feel it is not necessary for parents to know their teachers religion. In cases where it is obvious that the teachers religious views will not affect the teaching of their child, such as in a history class, we feel it is not necessary for parents to know the religion of the teacher. We feel that it is important for teachers to be respectful of the children's and parents' religious views, and if a teacher is teaching a topic that they have strong opinions about, they should be cautious about bringing their personal opinions into the lesson.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, parents should have the right to know the religion of their child’s teacher. However, there are some exceptions to this. For example, if the teacher’s religion is going to impact the child’s curriculum and learning in a negative way, then it is important that the parents are made aware of this. However, if the teacher’s religion is not going to impact the child’s curriculum and learning, then it is not important that the parents are made aware of this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that parents should have the right to know the religion of their child’s teachers. We believe that this is because it is important to know what their child is being taught and what they are being exposed to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Parents should have the right to know the religion of their child's teachers if the teacher will introduce their religion into their teachings.
