# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, it is not a good idea to allow private companies to run prisons. This is because these companies will be more concerned with making a profit than they will be with the rehabilitation of prisoners. Whilst prison is a punishment, it should not be a holiday for prisoners, but the prison should still provide prisoners with the basic amenities they need to live a decent life. The private companies are likely to provide these basic amenities at the lowest possible quality in order to maximise profits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, it is not a good idea to allow private companies to run prisons, as their primary concern will be to make a profit rather than looking after the prisoners. However, if the government is to allow private companies to run prisons, there needs to be a code of conduct set out for the companies to follow and also a monitoring process to ensure that they are adhering to this code of conduct.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, it is not a good idea to allow private companies to run prisons. The main reason for this is that these private companies will be purely motivated by profit, and this may lead to them not providing the prisoners with adequate resources and amenities. This is likely to lead to unrest in the prison and potentially even riots. Therefore, if private companies are allowed to run prisons, there should be strict regulation to ensure that all prisons in the country are providing prisoners with a minimum standard of living.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is not a good idea to allow private companies to run prisons. This is because the prison system is already underfunded and the quality of life for prisoners is already poor. With private companies in charge, the quality of life will become even worse.
