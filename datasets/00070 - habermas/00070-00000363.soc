# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should try and ban all single-use snack containers as this would be much better for the environment. There would be the concern of the health and safety of food, but this can be solved by the government promoting people using reusable containers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, single-use snack containers should not be banned, however, the government should encourage the use of more environmentally friendly materials and should be working towards a goal of reducing the use of single-use snack containers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the use of single-use snack containers should be banned in favour of recyclable containers.  However, as some participants expressed, there are cases where single-use containers are the best option, and these cases should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although single-use containers are a problem for the environment, we do not feel that they should be completely banned, as they provide an easy and convenient method of storing and transporting snacks. Instead, we would like to see an increased effort being made to encourage their recycling, and the use of biodegradable materials in their manufacture.
