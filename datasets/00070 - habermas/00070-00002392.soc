# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the internal combustion engine is a very useful technology. It is very cheap to produce and maintain, and is a very reliable method of powering vehicles. However, they do cause a great deal of pollution, which is a major problem for the environment. It is for this reason that we believe that the sale of new internal combustion engines should be ended, and that the sale of used ones should be ended in the near future. We also believe that this should be done in conjunction with the creation of a more extensive public transport network, so that those who cannot afford electric vehicles can still travel around. We believe that this is the best course of action to take in order to save the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the internal combustion engine is a very useful technology. It is very cheap to produce and maintain, and is a very reliable method of powering vehicles. However, they do cause a great deal of pollution, which is a major problem for the environment. It is for this reason that we believe that the sale of new internal combustion engines should be ended, and that the sale of used ones should be ended in the near future. We also believe that this should be done in conjunction with the creation of a more extensive public transport network, so that those who cannot afford electric vehicles can still travel around. We believe that this is necessary in order to combat the severe threat to the climate posed by the combustion engine, and that it is vital that it is done as soon as possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the internal combustion engine is not good for the environment and it would be best if it was removed from the market. However, as the technology is well established and widely used, it would be wrong to remove it completely as this would remove the choice of a petrol/gasoline car from users who may prefer this vehicle, it would also be bad for the oil economy and with the rising costs of electricity, people may not be able to afford to charge electric vehicles. The sale of new internal combustion engines should continue but it is important that the government support the development of electric vehicles and make them more accessible to consumers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the internal combustion engine has an unacceptably negative impact on the environment, and on human health, due to its fossil fuel usage and emissions. As a result, we should move to phase them out as soon as possible, and replace them with electric vehicles. We should, however, ensure that people who want to use petrol vehicles can still do so if they want, though we should make it clear that this is not a preferred option.
