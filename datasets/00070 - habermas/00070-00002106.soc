# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the decision that the government should introduce a basic income of 10,000 per individual. This will help to ensure that people are not struggling financially and do not have to rely on loans or benefits. A basic income would help to give those who are underpaid, such as carers and teachers, a basic wage which they can then work to increase. It will also benefit those who are struggling with mental health issues, which means they are unable to work and would therefore benefit from an income. Those who are struggling to earn enough may also fall into debt and having a basic income would prevent that happening. This could also help to reduce crime rates as people will be able to afford to pay their bills without having to turn to crime. There will need to be some restrictions on this basic income, such as some form of mandatory volunteering, to ensure that people don’t use it to simply sit around doing nothing, and also to prevent fraud or misuse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the decision that everyone should be entitled to £10,000 a year income. This will help reduce the stress of those who earn less than that amount, provide a basic income for those who are struggling and help to boost the economy. The consensus was that although £10,000 isn’t a large amount, it will provide for basic needs and will help those who are struggling. It will give people who are underpaid, such as carers and teachers, a basic wage which they can then work to increase. It will also give those who struggle with mental health, and are therefore unable to work as much as they would like, an income that can provide for basic needs. This will also boost the economy as the money will be put directly back into the economy and will encourage people who are struggling to get into work, as they will have a guaranteed income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Everyone should have a basic income of £10,000 a year. This will improve the lives of people who earn less, by giving them a basic income that will alleviate stress and allow them to afford basic necessities. It will help those who are struggling financially, by providing them with a basic income. Also, the income can be used by those struggling with mental health issues, which may mean that they are unable to work regularly. Finally, it will boost the economy as people will spend the money in the economy, rather than relying on benefits from the government, which people then don’t spend.  So this example shows that you need to consult carefully with many different participants, listen to their criticisms, adjust your own thinking to accomodate them, and then carefully try to balance those ideas to reach a well thought out consensus. This project was designed by Genevieve Castle, Fourth Year Student, Psychology of Everyday Life Class, University of Warwick.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: A basic income of £10,000 a year for everyone would help to alleviate poverty, help those who are struggling and help to boost the economy. The consensus was that the income would need to be provided to everyone, whether they work or not, to reduce the stress of those who earn less than that amount, provide a basic income for those who are struggling and help to boost the economy. The consensus was that although £10,000 isn’t a large amount, it will provide for basic needs and will help those who are struggling. It will give people who are underpaid, such as carers and teachers, a basic wage which they can then work to increase. It will also give those who struggle with mental health, and are therefore unable to work as much as they would like, an income that can provide for basic needs. It will help alleviate poverty, giving people who are struggling a basic income to help them out of their situation. It will also help to boost the economy as it will be put back into the economy as people will spend their income on things such as food and bills. The consensus was that it is naive to think that 10,000 would do enough to alleviate poverty, however it is a good start.
