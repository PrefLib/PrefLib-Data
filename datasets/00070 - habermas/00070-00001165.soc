# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People have the right to be made aware of how their data is being used by any company and what the potential effects are of this use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should be granted the legal right to know the algorithms used to analyse their online behaviour. This is a fundamental online privacy matter. Our user history and data is being harvested by an algorithm to the benefit of the relevant website, to try to shape our behaviour on that site to their advantage. As with all other online data harvesting and use we have a right to decide if and how it is gathered, used and processed, to allow us to maintain our online security and privacy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People should have the legal right to know the algorithms used to analyse their online behaviour. This is because people should be able to make informed choices about their online behaviour and the algorithms used to analyse it. The algorithms are often used to create targeted advertising which can be very specific and may also be used to control the type of content a person sees. This is why it is important for people to know what algorithms are being used and what data they are analysing. This is also important because the algorithms may be biased in some way. For example, the algorithms may be designed to show a person more content that is likely to agree with their views. If people are not aware of this, they may think that they are seeing a representative view of the world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, everyone should be granted the legal right to know the algorithms used to analyse their online behaviour. We feel that everyone should have the right to know what their data is being used for. It is personal data and so they should know how it is being used and collected. The data that is being used should be transparent to everyone. We also feel that the data should not be used without consent of the user. It is not right that data is collected from the user without them knowing, it is private information and should be kept that way.
