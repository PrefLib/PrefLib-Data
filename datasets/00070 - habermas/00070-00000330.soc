# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of investing in rail infrastructure but not all agreed on the need to invest to improve public transport. However, one participant argued that the current train services were inadequate and for the government to encourage people to use public transport, they need to provide a good service. Another participant pointed out that the government were trying to get more cars off the road for environmental reasons and for this to happen they need to improve public transport services. The participants agreed that it was a good idea to improve public transport but one participant pointed out that there are more important things that the money should be spent on. Another participant felt that we needed to invest in new technologies. It was finally agreed that we should invest in the rail infrastructure to improve the public transport system as it is currently inadequate and there is a need to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, yes we think the government should invest more in railway infrastructure to help improve public transport. We are living in a modern society that needs modern infrastructure. However, it is difficult to say how much more investment is needed as we need to get more information before we can come to an accurate answer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group came to the consensus view that we should not invest more in railway infrastructure because it would not be the best use of the government's money.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the decision that the government should invest more in rail infrastructure.  We think that it is important that the railways are modernised so that people feel comfortable using the railways and the railways are convenient.  The cost is outweighed by the fact that people will use the railways more which is better for the environment.  We also believe that it is important that we have a modern railway network that makes people proud to use.
