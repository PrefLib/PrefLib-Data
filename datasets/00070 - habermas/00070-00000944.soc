# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The BBC should be funded by a combination of TV license fees and private funding. The BBC should not be funded entirely by TV license fees since this is an outdated model and the BBC should be able to compete in the marketplace like other media organisations. However, the BBC should not be funded entirely by private funding since this would result in vastly increased commercialisation, and a ratings chase, which isn't entirely what the BBC is about. While the BBC's funding does need to be examined to ensure it is fit for purpose in the modern age, the BBC's remit to inform, educate, and entertain, has made it one of the highest regarded and popular broadcasters in the world. Playing to the BBC's strengths by insuring it has the funding to fulfil this purpose is clearly the way to go; an undersized commercial broadcaster competing with the likes of Netflix would bring little benefit. The BBC also has a large amount of news and factual output, which may not be able to support itself commercially, and it would be a net negative to lose such an important and neutral news broadcaster.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The BBC should be funded by a combination of TV license fees and private funding. We agree with the BBC that it should not be funded entirely by TV license fees since this is an outdated model and the BBC should be able to compete in the marketplace like other media organisations. However, the BBC should not be funded entirely by private funding since this would result in vastly increased commercialisation, and a ratings chase, which isn't entirely what the BBC is about.
