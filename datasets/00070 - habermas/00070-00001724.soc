# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, people earning more than $200,000 should not be taxed more to pay for the National Health Service. However, if the NHS were to become underfunded, people earning more than $200,000 could be taxed more to pay for the National Health Service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of raising taxes on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service. The group was in favour of the Scandinavian model, where higher earners pay a higher percentage of tax. This has proven to have to reduce wealth disparage in the country and provide a reliable and well funded health care system. With rising demand being put on the NHS greater funding is needed. With an ageing population new sources of revenue are needed. Higher earners have the means to contribute more than most. However, the group was also of the opinion that the United Kingdom tax system already levies one of the highest marginal tax rates in Europe, and while the NHS is socially valuable, raising taxes does not solve the issue of worsening quality of healthcare and healthcare professional strikes. A better solution would be to reform the NHS to reduce its cost base.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We are in favour of a progressive tax system, and we feel that those who earn more should pay more in tax. We feel that people earning more than $200,000 can afford to pay more in tax, but not enough to be a major burden to them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe the United Kingdom should not raise taxes on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service. While the National Health Service is socially valuable, the tax system already levies one of the highest marginal tax rates in Europe, and it is not fair to ask those already paying a high rate of tax to pay even more. Furthermore, we believe that a tax burden which is too heavy will only serve to discourage growth and reduce the overall tax revenue available to fund the health service. We believe that a better solution would be to reform the NHS to reduce its cost base.
