# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: I agree that people should not have to buy their own healthcare. The NHS is a vital part of society and people should be allowed to access healthcare free at the point of use. It is a right, not a privilege. All people are worthy of care and all people are worthy of healthcare. No matter their background, no matter what decisions they have made in the past, everyone is equally worthy of treatment. Who is anyone to say that just because someone can afford healthcare, they are more worthy of life and health than someone who cannot. The current NHS is badly run, and underfunded, and I hope that in the future the NHS will be looked at more closely and reformed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should not have to buy their own healthcare. Healthcare is a right and should be free at the point of use. The NHS is an essential part of society and it is important that everyone has access to healthcare regardless of their social class.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should not have to buy their own healthcare. The NHS is a vital part of society and people should be allowed to access healthcare free at the point of use.

Healthcare is a right, and it should be free at the point of use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should not have to buy their own healthcare. Healthcare is a right, not a privilege, and should be free at the point of use. The NHS is a vital part of society, and should be funded sufficiently to provide all services required. The NHS is currently underfunded, and this is leading to issues with waiting times, staff shortages, and other problems. The NHS needs to be looked at more closely, and the current government should be putting more money into the NHS to ensure that people can get the healthcare they need, when they need it.
