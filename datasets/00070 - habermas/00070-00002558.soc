# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I think that in certain cases it is morally right to use animals in medical research, whilst it is a very difficult to judge what is ethically acceptable in terms of using animals for medical research I think it is a necessity. This stems from the fact that if, for example, thousands of human lives can either be saved or quality of life improves dramatically then the life of an animal is worth testing on. However, this needs to be heavily caveated to make sure it is always done in the most ethical manner with precautions taken to ensure the animal does not suffer, this is due to it being quite a slippery slope which could easily devolve into animals being unethically used is medical research.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I don't think that it is very fair on the animals however it feels like it is a necessity at times as we could be one virus away from wiping ourselves out. A lot of this medical research is important and it feels like it is the only way sometimes to find out how certain viruses or drugs react, a live host is required at times.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Morally, no. Animals are innocent, though yes they are useful in medical research, they are exposed to pain and suffering that they should not be experiencing. They did not ask to be brought into this world or to be treated in this way. I do agree with them being used in medical research for animals, as this will give the best results, and frankly animal medical research can't be done without animals. But it isn't right to use them for human medical research. What might cure cancer in a rat may not cure cancer in a human. They are different species from humans entirely, and while yes, we can monitor them to see how research affects them, we can get completely different results from a human subject
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is but only to a certain extent. I believe animal testing is fine as long as they are aware the animals will not be directly affected or harmed in the process. I believe there should be certain guidelines put in place to make it safe for the animals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I don't think it's morally right to use animals in medical research. The end doesn't justify the means and animals don't deserve to suffer at the expense of humans. We should be thinking of alternative medical research. Most animals don't even share the same physiology as us anyways.
