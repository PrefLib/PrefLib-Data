# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the idea that the Prime Minister should be able to use AI to provide advice. The group was of the opinion that the Prime Minister should not rely solely on AI to provide advice, but that it should be used to provide a more well-rounded opinion on a particular issue. The group felt that the Prime Minister would not be able to rely solely on AI, as the Prime Minister would need to make the final decision on the matter, and that a human should be responsible for this. The group was of the opinion that the Prime Minister would be able to use AI to provide advice on more technical matters, but that the Prime Minister should not use AI for advice on matters of morality, as this would not be appropriate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, the group has decided that AI should not be used to provide political advice to the prime minister. This is because we feel that a human should be providing the advice as they are the ones who have been voted into power and they are the ones who will have to take responsibility for the advice they have given. The group also feel that it is very important for the advice to be given by a human as it will have a personal touch to it, something that AI will not be able to provide. The group feel that the advice should come from someone who is willing to take responsibility for the advice they have given.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the use of AI to provide political advice to the prime minister should be legal. However, there are some situations in which the use of AI should be prohibited. For example, in situations where the advice provided by the AI could have a significant impact on people's lives, the prime minister should not be allowed to use AI. In addition, if the prime minister uses AI in a way that is not in line with the law, the use of AI should be prohibited.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of using AI to provide political advice to the Prime Minister. The group felt that AI should not be used for this purpose as it is an important job and should be done by a human being. The group also felt that AI should not be used for this purpose as the Prime Minister should be held accountable for their actions and therefore, they should make their own decisions.
