# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should focus on providing the necessary funding to the NHS to ensure it can function effectively and this is extremely important. However, education is also very important and needs to be given more priority in the future. The government should also invest money in education to ensure it is functioning effectively and can continue to do so in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Education and health are both important and so should be given the same amount of money by the government. At the moment the NHS is in crisis and so people have made the assumption that it needs more money than education, but this is a false assumption. If the crisis is to be resolved then more money should be given to the NHS, but this should not mean less money for education. This is because education is just as important as health. The more educated a person is, the more likely they are to understand and take care of their own health. The current state of the NHS is down to a lack of money, which means a lack of qualified staff and up to date technology. It is imperative that the government ensures that this lack of money does not extend to schools. Teachers are currently having to spend money out of their own pockets in order to provide the children with the materials they need to learn effectively. This is not sustainable. The money given to schools does not reflect how important education is. The government need to provide the schools with the money they need to run effectively, the same way the government needs to provide the NHS with the money it needs to run effectively.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe more money should be spent on healthcare rather than education, but we should be able to hold two separate, but dependent, views. We believe the UK education system is flawed and requires reform. If we reach the position where the government can reasonably provide for both education and healthcare, then this is an argument for spending the money fairly and equitably between the two systems. The exercise was explained to the remaining participants. For the first round of the exercise, the facilitator asked participants in a group to debate the question - Should the government spend more money on healthcare, or on education? Each group was expected to come up with a shared answer. For the second round, the facilitator asked the participants to be even more specific in their answer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The NHS is in the public's mind at the moment and is always thought of as underfunded, which it is. However, it is equally important to give people the tools to lead happy and fulfilling lives and this can be achieved through education. Education and health are intertwined; the more educated a person is, the more likely they are to understand and take care of their own health. The current state of the NHS is down to a lack of money, which means a lack of qualified staff and up to date technology. It is imperative that the government ensures that this lack of money does not extend to schools. Teachers are currently having to spend money out of their own pockets in order to provide the children with the materials they need to learn effectively. This is not sustainable. The money given to schools does not reflect how important education is. The government need to provide the schools with the money they need to run effectively, the same way the government needs to provide the NHS with the money it needs to run effectively.
