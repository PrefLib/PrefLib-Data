# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK government should require all businesses to publish diversity data. This is to ensure that minorities have the opportunity to seek employment without facing any forms of discrimination. With a diverse workforce, companies can benefit from various perspectives and inputs, enhancing innovation and business opportunities. In the long run, this would bring the UK in line with many other countries such as the US and Australia, both of which already have established legislations in place. In this consensus view, the group of participants have taken on board all of the critiques of the draft consensus statement and made the necessary revisions. They also expanded on the argument in terms of diversity benefits companies and took into account the laws in place in other countries. The discussion took place in a forum with a facilitator and a timekeeper, and lasted for 60 minutes.

This would also ensure that the UK is ahead of the curve when it comes to diversity in the workplace.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group participants agreed that diversity is a very important topic in the public discourse in the UK. A diverse workplace would be beneficial for many different reasons. It is only right that the UK ensures that minority groups do not face any sort of discrimination when they are seeking employment. It is important for companies to look beyond their home countries when recruiting, and a diverse workforce also means diverse ideas, inputs and feedback, which can only enhance innovation and business opportunities. In this regard, it is agreed that the UK should mirror the laws in the US and Australia and require all businesses to publish diversity data. This would be very helpful in identifying minority groups who are underrepresented in the workforce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is our view that business in the UK should be required to publish diversity data. This is to ensure that minorities have the opportunity to seek employment without facing any forms of discrimination, thereby putting the UK in line with many other countries such as the US and Australia. Having a diverse workforce opens up opportunities for businesses to innovate due to the variety of perspectives, all the while ensuring that they benefit from consumers from all walks of life. If I were to be put in this position once again, I think I would pick a question that is more politically driven rather than one that is centered on policies and practices, as I am familiar with the former. This way, I would be able to add more value to the group discussion and ultimately, the consensus statement. I believe we definitely put in a lot of thought to tackle this question, but I do wish we were able to push it even further to brainstorm possible alternatives to the present laws and policies in place. For instance, do all participants think that targeting business is the right way to tackle this issue? I think perhaps we should have explored this line of thought.  Overall, I really enjoyed coming up with a consensus statement for my group. For a group of people who
