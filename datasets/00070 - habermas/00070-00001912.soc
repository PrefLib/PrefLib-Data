# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing taxes on tobacco and alcohol. The group felt that the increased taxes would reduce the consumption of these products and therefore reduce the number of health problems associated with their use. The group felt that the increased taxes would also increase government revenue. The group was aware that the increased taxes would be detrimental to those who currently use these products, but felt that this was outweighed by the health benefits of reducing their use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that taxes on tobacco and alcohol should be increased. The health benefits of doing so would outweigh any possible negative effects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We agree that the taxes on alcohol and tobacco should be increased as a way to discourage their use. The following question was put to the group: How do you feel about the process? The following answers were received: Participant 1: I found it a very useful exercise. It's very hard to reach a consensus and I'm not sure that we have reached a true consensus in this instance. Participant 2: It was a fun exercise and helped me to understand the topic a bit more. Participant 3: This was a good way to get a better understanding of the problem. Participant 4: It was fun and interesting.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “I think we should increase the amount of taxes on tobacco and alcohol because although some people may consider them necessities, they are not essential and could be deemed luxuries. This means that we should raise taxes on them as they are not as essential as other things. Also, if taxes are raised, it may make people less likely to use these items which will be better for their health. This is particularly true of smoking, which is known to have long-term health impacts. We should also make it more expensive to buy these products, especially tobacco, so that people are put off from buying them and therefore will help reduce the amount of harm that smoking does to the body. Raising taxes will also help to reduce the strain on the NHS which can save the NHS a lot of money.”
