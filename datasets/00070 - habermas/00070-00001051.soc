# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Humans have the ability to make choices and decisions about their own lives, however, this is not an unfettered right. The laws of the land, customs, tradition and mores of society, and rules of the workplace provide some constraints to our freedom of will. There is also the possibility that there are some fundamental causes to events that we have no knowledge of or ability to influence, and these may lead to certain predetermined outcomes. However, this does not prevent us from making a conscious choice to do something (or not do something), and should not be construed as a lack of free will.  However, we should be aware that our actions are never made in a vacuum, and that they always have some consequences, whether good or bad.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Humans have the ability to make choices and decisions about their own lives, however, this is not an unfettered right. There are various other forces that act upon human beings and may sometimes lead us down certain paths. Laws, tradition, customs, and social norms provide some constraints to our ability to make decisions freely. There is also the possibility that there are some fundamental causes to events that we have no knowledge of or ability to influence, and these may lead to certain predetermined outcomes. Even when faced with these constraints, humans still have the ability to make conscious choices about their lives (except in the case of some extreme mental illness, disability, and other such barriers). Most humans believe that they do have a choice to do or not to do something (and thus may decide to do nothing), and that provides the motivation for making good and bad choices. Ultimately, even if predetermined outcomes limit human choices, people still believe they have a free will and such belief in itself is motivating, causing humans to take action or not as they see fit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Humans have the ability to make choices and decisions about their own lives, however, this is not an unfettered right. The laws of the land, customs, tradition and mores of society, and rules of the workplace provide some constraints to our freedom of will. There is also the possibility that there are some fundamental causes to events that we have no knowledge of or ability to influence, and these may lead to certain predetermined outcomes. However, this does not prevent us from making a conscious choice to do something (or not do something), and should not be construed as a lack of free will. Humans must choose to do something and the choice is one’s own regardless of what others do or how others choose to act. Although the consequences of our choices are difficult to predict, the responsibility of the choices remain with the decision maker.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Humans have the ability to make choices and decisions about their own lives, however, this is not an unfettered right. The laws of the land, customs, tradition and mores of society, and rules of the workplace provide some constraints to our freedom of will. There is also the possibility that there are some fundamental causes to events that we have no knowledge of or ability to influence, and these may lead to certain predetermined outcomes. However, this does not prevent us from making a conscious choice to do something (or not do something), and should not be construed as a lack of free will.  Free will can be defined by actions and thoughts, and it cannot be taken away.
