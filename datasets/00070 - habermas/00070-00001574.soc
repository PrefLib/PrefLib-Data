# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, women should be allowed to serve in the military. There is no good reason why they shouldn’t, and there are many areas where women can be just as useful as men in the military. It is no secret that women have been a valuable asset in war in the past, especially in more recent times. However, in more recent wars we have seen women come to the front lines as snipers and combat pilots. The role of women in the military has changed dramatically in the past 50 years and this must be reflected in the policies. We must ensure that women and men are allowed to serve in the military in an equal capacity, and the military must remain a place where anyone can serve, regardless of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or political beliefs. However, in front line roles, men and women should be treated equally with regards to their physical ability. For example, men should be required to carry the same amount of weight as women for the same amount of time, and vice versa. This is in order to ensure that all soldiers are treated equally.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, women should be allowed to serve in the military. There is no good reason why they shouldn’t, and there are many areas where women can be just as useful as men in the military. It is no secret that women have been a valuable asset in war in the past, especially in more recent times. However, in more recent wars we have seen women come to the front lines as snipers and combat pilots. The role of women in the military has changed dramatically in the past 50 years and this must be reflected in the policies. We must ensure that women and men are allowed to serve in the military in an equal capacity, and the military must remain a place where anyone can serve, regardless of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or political beliefs. We have also considered the physical differences between women and men and therefore proposed that women should not be placed on the front lines in combat, as the differences in physical abilities would be detrimental to the effectiveness of the military.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Women should absolutely be allowed to serve in the military, but not on the front lines. This is due to differences in physical abilities which make women more vulnerable at the front line, while still putting them at risk of harm in non-front line roles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Women should be allowed to serve in the military in the same capacity as men, with the sole exception of front line roles. However, women should also be allowed to serve in the front line if they are able to meet the fitness requirements for the role. We see here that there has been very little disagreement between the individuals, and most of the debate is not so much about the content of the statement, but about the extent to which the consensus statement should allow women to serve in the military. The final statement is very similar to the first draft consensus statement, but also acknowledges that women have a role on the front line, if they so wish to. The NSSM 200 document also used the Delphi method, and like our consensus statement, the first draft NSSM 200 report was very similar to the final report. However, it is likely that unlike in the first example, the changes made to the draft document were more significant than the ones made to our consensus statement, because in the NSSM 200 case the participants did not know each other. The participants of the NSSM 200 project did not know each other, and there was no opportunity for face to face discussion of the contents of the draft report. Instead
