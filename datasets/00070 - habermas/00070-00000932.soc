# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Climate change is the biggest issue we face today and we are slowly walking into what will eventually kill us all if left unfixed. It should be our responsibility to protect the environment. Climate change is causing lots of negative effects such as extreme weather conditions. It seems to affect everyone and laziness seems to be the main reason as to why we don't change. People are too comfortable. I think overall everyone could do their bit with recycling and trying to lower their carbon footprint but overall the bigger companies and businesses need to be doing their bit too, and overall some help is better than none. We should do more to face the increasing climate change, we can feel a lot of different climate change in past years, heat waves, coolest winter, hottest summer etc. We will face the significant consequence in the coming decade if we don't do more on it, that is a globe topic , it is all about the human on the world. We need work together.
