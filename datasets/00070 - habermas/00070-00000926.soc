# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Cannabis should be legalised for medical use. It is proven to help people with certain conditions, such as chronic pain, nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, and muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis. However, there are also potential risks and side effects associated with cannabis use, such as impaired cognitive function, addiction and respiratory problems.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of legalising cannabis for medical use, however, they felt that there should be safeguards in place to ensure that it is used in a safe and responsible manner. The group also felt that it would be important to consider the potential risks and side effects associated with cannabis use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “With the appropriate safeguards in place, there should be no reasonable objection to cannabis being legalised for medical use. If there is a therapeutic use for a substance, and it can be controlled and the safety shown to be acceptable, it should be used. This could be part of a comprehensive relook at cannabis controls, or solely has part of a medical programme, in which case there will need to be controls looked at - but this is done already with controlled substances, some of which are highly addictive, unlike cannabis.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Cannabis should be legalised for medical use, however, we must be aware of the possible side effects of the drug, such as impaired cognitive function, addiction and respiratory problems. We must also consider that the cannabis plant can be used for more than just recreational purposes and it can be used in other areas, such as textiles, paper, biofuel and food. The plant can be used for medicinal purposes and can also be used for more than just that. Therefore, we must be aware of the uses of the cannabis plant and not just its recreational use.”
