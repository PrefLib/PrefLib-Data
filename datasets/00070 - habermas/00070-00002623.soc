# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes. I believe that it is the governments responsibility to look after public's health. I think they have other areas where they can cut back and concentrate on people's health as it is the most important thing in everyones lives. Without good health people will be an even bigger burden on the NHS in treating different health problems or symptoms. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: to some extent yes the government have a responsibility to ensure that new medicines are researched but this should be multiple countries researching rather than one 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I'm pretty neutral on the issue, but I'm now leaning towards no. I think big pharma has ample funding independently. Thus, government funds could probably be dedicated to better uses, such as ensuring that everyone has access to the new medicines created, regardless of their income bracket.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I think the overall responsibility for the creation of new medicines probably lies with the pharmaceutical companies, however it would be appropriate for the government to support these companies for the greater good.  Perhaps the pharmaceutical companies research and develop the products in return for grants/prescribing rights with the NHS when the medicines are ready for use? It's a difficult one, as the pharma companies are private entities, and should the public purse be supporting private businesses? There is a moral element to consider, as people have a right to appropriate healthcare and the government should be behind this all the way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Medicinal evolution must keep pace with mutations and changes in diseases and viruses etc.  The government should  fund a large part of this medicine creation and also incentivise big pharma to develop new medicines and vaccines in future to meet the needs of our planet.  The recent Covid pandemic should leave no doubt that the development of new medicines is vital to human kind.
