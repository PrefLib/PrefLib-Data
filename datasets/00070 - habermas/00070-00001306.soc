# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The current system of organ donation is ethically sound. The system is built on a foundation of respect for individual autonomy and a presumption in favour of donation. It is also built on a system of presumed consent, with the option to opt-out if one does not want to be an organ donor. This makes it very difficult to argue that the system is not ethically sound. The system could be improved, however, by making the default option to be a donor, rather than the other way around. This would increase the number of organs available for donation, and help to reduce the number of people on the waiting list. This is a good system that ensures that people are not forced to donate their organs, and ensures that people are able to donate their organs to help others in need.
