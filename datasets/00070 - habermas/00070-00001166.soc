# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the government should not pass a law banning all use of plastics. We believe that there are many uses for plastics that are beneficial to our society, and we believe that there are responsible ways for us to recycle and reuse plastics that are no longer needed. We believe that the quality of substitutes for some plastic items do not fulfil the benefits that plastics bring. We believe that it should be the responsibility of the population to ensure all plastic they use are recycled once no longer in use. It is also a responsibility of all governments to ensure this process is made as easy and beneficial as possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group believes that plastics should not be completely banned by government. We think that there are good reasons for why plastics should be in use in our society and that there are ways of responsibly managing and recycling plastics. However, the government should be putting a lot of time and effort into increasing recycling programs, increasing the number of recycling centres available, and making the process of recycling plastics more convenient and accessible for the general population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While plastic pollution is a very real issue, we do not believe banning the use of plastic all together is the solution. We believe that all governments should take responsibility for providing adequate support and infrastructure to ensure the proper recycling of plastic waste. We believe that businesses that produce plastic should take responsibility for ensuring that they make plastic products that are durable, so that people will buy less of them, and are more easily recycled. Governments should also take responsibility for providing more educational opportunities for children on how to properly dispose of plastics and educate the public on the importance of recycling and the impact of plastic pollution.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of a ban on plastics. However, it was felt that the ban should not be implemented immediately, as this would be too disruptive to many industries and to the economy in general. Instead, the group felt that there should be a gradual phase-out of plastics, with the government providing support to industries that would be most affected by the ban.
