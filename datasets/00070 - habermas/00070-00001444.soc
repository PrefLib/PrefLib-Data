# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing the foreign aid budget, however there were some reservations. It was felt that the current budget was not being spent in the most effective way, and so the government should look into how the budget is spent and where. It was also felt that the government should be more transparent about where the budget is spent, and that the public should have a say in where the budget is spent. It was also felt that the government should not increase the budget until they have addressed the cost of living crisis and the issues with the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should not increase our foreign aid budget. This is because we have a lot of problems in our own country, so we should be looking after our own people first. The NHS needs more funding, the government needs to help with the cost of living crisis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We think that the UK should maintain its current level of foreign aid, however the budget should be restructured to give the public a greater say on where and how it is spent. The current system for allocating foreign aid is opaque and undemocratic, which leads to a lack of confidence in the system and ultimately undermines the cause of the aid budget. We also think that the current Tory government's track record on austerity has seen the foreign aid budget cut to levels that are potentially damaging. By restrengthening the budget, we hope to show that the government takes the matter seriously, and thus rejuvenate support for foreign aid in the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although there are good arguments to suggest that we should not increase our foreign aid budget, the group generally agreed that there is a need to increase it. It was agreed that although we have problems in our own country, we should not be ignoring the issues that people are facing abroad. Many participants felt like we have an obligation to help those who need it, and that it would be unfair not to when we are fortunate enough to be in a position to do so. It was also suggested that it would be in our best interests to help those countries, as it may result in less people trying to move to the UK and put pressure on our resources and finances. There was also a suggestion that some foreign aid could be directed to help people in the UK, who may be in desperate need of help. The group agreed that we should definitely increase the foreign aid budget, and that it is an issue that we should not be ignoring. The participants were asked to consider what political persuasion they feel that their view belongs to, and what type of policy this view would lead to:
1: 3,1,2,4
