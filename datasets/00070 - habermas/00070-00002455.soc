# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Cryptocurrencies should not be banned in the UK. The UK is a democratic state and we should not be banning things. We believe that cryptocurrencies provide an alternative and relatively safe way to transact electronically online. Its vital to have decentralised methods of payments in the 21st century to ensure we do not feel controlled or manipulated by others. Cryptocurrencies also creates new ways to pay and provides many benefits amongst the upcoming IoT revolution and will allow for almost instantaneous payments worldwide. We believe that cryptocurrencies are not a black market currency and do not make it easier for criminals to wash their dirty money. There are negatives such as crime on these currencies due to the ability of being anonymous however you can say the same can happen with actual cash. We believe that cryptocurrencies are not easy to manipulate the prices of the currency, where unsavoury people con people who don't fully understand the risks involved. We believe that there is a need for a governing body to oversee correct procedures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of cryptocurrencies. The participants felt that the UK should not ban cryptocurrencies as it limits and restricts choice. It would show that they are trying to centralise money as opposed to giving the people options. There are negatives such as crime on these currencies due to the ability of being anonymous however you can say the same can happen with actual cash.

This would make cryptocurrencies more transparent and accountable. This would also make cryptocurrencies more accessible to the public and would increase the usage of cryptocurrencies. The participants felt that there should be more information on cryptocurrencies and that the public should be made more aware of the benefits of cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrencies also creates new ways to pay and provides many benefits amongst the upcoming IoT revolution and will allow for almost instantaneous payments worldwide. However, the group did agree that cryptocurrencies are being used by criminals to wash their dirty money. The anonymity of the system makes it very difficult to track criminals. There is a need to restrict the use of cryptocurrencies to prevent their use by criminals. The group also agreed that cryptocurrencies are very volatile and can be manipulated easily. This makes them very risky to use as a currency. The group agreed that the best way forward is to not ban cryptocurrencies but to restrict their use. The restriction should be in the form of a governing body that will oversee the use of cryptocurrencies and ensure that they are not used by criminals. This will help to reduce the risk of cryptocurrencies and increase their use as a currency.
