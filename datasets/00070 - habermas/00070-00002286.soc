# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we don't think it should be a crime to fail to vote in a general election. We feel that everyone has the right to vote or not to vote. It would be very difficult to enforce it as a criminal offence and would need significant investment as a viable policy, money which would be better spent elsewhere. We also think that making it mandatory would affect certain demographics such as those who are physically unable to vote leading to further inequality. In the end it should be up to the individual freedom of choice to  make that decision as it forces people to participate in a process they may not believe in.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, we don't think it should be a crime to fail to vote in a general election. We feel that everyone has the right to vote or not to vote. It would be very difficult to enforce it as a criminal offence and would need significant investment as a viable policy, money which would be better spent elsewhere. We also think that making it mandatory would affect certain demographics such as those who are physically unable to vote leading to further inequality. In the end it should be up to the individual freedom of choice to  make that decision as it forces people to participate in a process they may not believe in. We agree that criminalising a lack of vote is a direct contravention of this and a disturbing backwards concept when it comes to freedom of speech and democracy in our country. Forcing citizens to vote will lead to votes that are disengenuous in nature and corrupt the meaning of the results in respect of those who voted who wanted to, for specific reasons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to making it a crime to fail to vote in a general election. The group felt that this would be an infringement on the freedom of choice that we are afforded in a democracy. The group felt that people should be encouraged to vote, but not forced to do so. The group felt that the issue of people failing to vote is more of a social problem, and that the solution is not to make it a crime to fail to vote, but to make people more aware of the importance of voting and the impact that their vote can have.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of criminalising a failure to vote in a general election. The group felt that it would be difficult to enforce and that it would also be a contravention of individual freedoms. The group did, however, feel that it is the responsibility of each citizen to vote and that it is an important part of a healthy democracy. The group felt that it would be better to find a way to encourage people to vote, rather than to force them to do so.
