# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: We came to the conclusion that nuclear energy is a very important source of energy and should be encouraged. However, there is a risk of meltdowns and this must be taken into account, especially by countries who are considering using nuclear energy. This being said, this does not mean it should be discouraged, but precautions must be taken.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the conclusion that nuclear energy is a very important source of energy. The issue of meltdowns is one that is not often discussed. The effects of a meltdown can be catastrophic but we feel that the risks are worth the gain. With the way the world is currently, the effects of climate change are becoming more and more apparent. We need to be looking at ways to reduce the effects of climate change and nuclear energy is one of the ways in which we can do this. If we are going to do this, it is also important to note that we need to consider the environment before and after a nuclear power plant, and make sure that it has as little impact as possible. There has been plenty of research done on the effects of nuclear energy on the environment, and we should use this research to reduce the impact, as much as possible, whilst ensuring that it does its main function; providing us with energy.

We need to invest in new technology in the nuclear energy sector as it is one of the main ways in which we can reduce carbon emissions.

This is a topic that is not often discussed but is a very important issue and needs to be addressed.

A group of participants was tasked with generating a business idea based on a theme. Below is presented the theme, the business idea generated by the group, and the rational for the idea. Theme: Technology has advanced to a stage where it is now possible to create an artificial human. However, there is an ethical debate as to whether it is right to do so. What is your opinion? If it is right to do so, how can this be used to create a business? Business idea: A human cloning company which specialises in cloning deceased relatives and celebrities. The clones would be used for various purposes such as companionship and also for medical experiments. The
