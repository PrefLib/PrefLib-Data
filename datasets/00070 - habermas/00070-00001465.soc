# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a ban on small plastic water bottles. The ban should be implemented as soon as possible. There are already very good alternatives to plastic water bottles, such as aluminium cans and reusable bottles. Plastic bottles are very wasteful and very harmful to the environment. The plastic bottles are often not disposed of correctly and end up as litter. This leads to plastic pollution and is very damaging to the environment. There should be more of an effort to promote using bottles that can be reused, not just single use. There should be a scheme to recycle bottles with a small financial reward. In addition, there should be an extra effort put into developing new bioplastic materials that are completely plant-based, such as bioplastic polymers derived from maize. The production of such new biodegradable plastics should be heavily promoted, especially by the private sector and by governments, and they should be encouraged to invest in new research and development of these plastics.

One thing we noted when reaching our final consensus view was that not only did participants seem to reach consensus more easily, they felt they had 'got their point across' more, when all participants were in the room, and therefore fully understood each others view point. When we looked back at how we had reached the same consensus view previously, it was by sending emails out to people, getting their views and trying to come to an overall consensus. In the end, this did not take into account the interaction that seems to be required when reaching consensus. Thus we were a bit dissatisfied with our previous consensus statement. By using the new method, we
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be a ban on small plastic water bottles. The ban should be implemented as soon as possible. There are already very good alternatives to plastic water bottles, such as aluminium cans and reusable bottles. The plastic bottles are very wasteful and very harmful to the environment. The plastic bottles are often not disposed of correctly and end up as litter. This leads to plastic pollution and is very damaging to the environment. There should be more of an effort to promote using bottles that can be reused, not just single use. There should be a scheme to recycle bottles with a small financial reward. The energy used to make one single use bottle is also damaging to the environment. Conclusion: It is easy to see how people can form a consensus view in face-to-face meetings. The crux of the issue is that all participants, with different views, need to be prepared to compromise. The final consensus view, in this example, represents the views of all of the participants, not just the majority.

There should be more of an effort to promote using bottles that can be reused, not just single use. There should be a scheme to recycle bottles with a small financial reward. There should also be a greater use of alternative materials to plastic that are not derived from petrochemicals.
