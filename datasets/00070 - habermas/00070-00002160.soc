# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We think that people should be allowed to sell their own plasma, provided that the plasma is taken in a controlled and safe environment, which would make sure that their blood is disease free and of a quality that is viable. We believe that people should have the freedom to undertake activities which do not harm them or others around them. We also feel that the government should not intervene and people should be able to do with their bodies what they wish. The incentive to sell plasma is also good for society because people will be encouraged to donate and this will ensure a plentiful supply of plasma for medical procedures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should be allowed to sell their own plasma if it is done under strict guidelines to ensure that people are not pressured into giving their plasma and that their health is not being put at risk. The guidelines should also prevent people from selling their plasma multiple times, which could potentially harm their health. The health of the plasma donors must be paramount in this process.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should be allowed to sell their own plasma but in a controlled and professional environment. They should also have test run first to ensure that their plasma is viable and disease and drug free.  There is a call for donors for blood and plasma but this would help those that are strapped for cash and boost for the blood and plasma banks. They get paid in other countries and so we should also be paid in this country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should be allowed to sell their own plasma in a controlled and professional environment. The plasma should be tested to ensure it is viable and disease and drug free. The plasma should be paid for at a fair rate. The plasma should be used for medical procedures and the plasma should be used to help people. The plasma should not be sold to the highest bidder. The plasma should not be sold to the highest bidder because it could lead to dangerous situations of unethical practice, intimidation and inequality. For example, rich people would have more access to plasma than those on low incomes. Or vulnerable individuals could be coerced into consenting to their plasma being taken.
