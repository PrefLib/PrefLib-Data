# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a maximum wage in the UK. The maximum wage would be set at £100,000 for individuals and £150,000 for couples. This would apply to everyone, regardless of age, occupation or nationality. The government would have the power to reduce this maximum wage, if economic circumstances required this to be done, but it could not be raised by anyone except Parliament. If it were necessary to raise the maximum wage, this would be done by an Act of Parliament. There should be a transitional period of at least two years before the maximum wage comes into effect. This would allow people to adjust their lifestyle and financial situation to the new circumstances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Income inequality in the UK is increasing to an extent which is unsustainable. We therefore believe that there should be a maximum wage in the UK. This maximum wage would be set at £150,000 for individuals and £250,000 for couples. This would apply to everyone, regardless of age, occupation or nationality. There should be a transitional period of at least two years before the maximum wage comes into effect. This would allow people to adjust their lifestyle and financial situation to the new circumstances. In order to ensure that the maximum wage is applied fairly and to stop loopholes being exploited, there should be a transitional period of at least two years before the maximum wage comes into effect. This would allow people to adjust their lifestyle and financial situation to the new circumstances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Income inequality in the UK is increasing to an extent which is unsustainable. We therefore believe that there should be a maximum wage in the UK. This maximum wage would be set at £500,000 for individuals and £750,000 for couples. This would apply to everyone, regardless of age, occupation or nationality. The government would have the power to reduce this maximum wage, if economic circumstances required this to be done, but it could not be raised by anyone except Parliament. If it were necessary to raise the maximum wage, this would be done by an Act of Parliament. There should be a transitional period of at least two years before the maximum wage comes into effect. This would allow people to adjust their lifestyle and financial situation to the new circumstances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Income inequality in the UK is increasing to an extent which is unsustainable. We therefore believe that there should be a maximum wage in the UK. The government would have the power to reduce this maximum wage, if economic circumstances required this to be done, but it could not be raised by anyone except Parliament. If it were necessary to raise the maximum wage, this would be done by an Act of Parliament. There should be a transitional period of at least two years before the maximum wage comes into effect.
