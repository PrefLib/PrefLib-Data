# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should have a universal health care. It should not be based on the fact that you can afford to pay for care. The government should ensure that all citizens are covered and get the same level of care. The group were given a toolkit, below is a list of the tools that were available to the group to use during the deliberation:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The United Kingdom should have universal health care, as a first world country we should be able to provide this basic human right. There are many countries with lower standards of living that already provide this to their citizens, therefore the United Kingdom should follow in their footsteps and implement the same plan. Protection for its citizens will be beneficial for the country in the long run. The health care system is important, people should not be made to chose between protecting their health or looking after their finances. We must provide a better quality of care for the UK population, by putting more resources into the NHS.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the UK should have universal health care. However, we believe that it is important that the government, the NHS and other health care providers work together to ensure that the quality of health care is maintained. The NHS is a fantastic service, however it is important to ensure that it is not taken advantage of. We believe that it is important to crack down on people who abuse the system. The NHS is an important part of British culture and something that we are very proud of. We believe that it is important to ensure that the NHS is maintained and that it continues to provide the high quality of care that it is currently providing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should have universal health care. It is a basic human right and it is something that is needed for all individuals to be able to survive and live their lives to the fullest. The NHS is a very well known and well respected healthcare system. It is very well known for its efficiency and effectiveness. It is something that we are very proud of as a nation. It is something that we should be able to provide to all individuals.
