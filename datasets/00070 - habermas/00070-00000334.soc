# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, doctors should be allowed to prescribe drugs with the knowledge that the drugs are dangerous as long as the risks are explained to the patient and as long as the patient consents to accepting these risks.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be some room for liability, as it can protect consumers from very dangerous products, and potentially reduce medical experimentation in humans.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is the opinion of the group that doctors should not be able to prescribe any drug without consent of the patient, and should be sued if they are prescribing drugs which they know will have dangerous side effects. The group believes that this would prevent future malpractice, and protect patients. However, the group also believes that there should be a limit on the amount of compensation, as it would be unfair for the patient to receive excessive amounts of money. This would also ensure that doctors are still willing to try experimental drugs on patients. The group believes that this would encourage doctors to only prescribe drugs which have been approved, and would reduce the number of dangerous drugs being prescribed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Doctors should be held liable for prescribing drugs that they know to be dangerous, as it is their duty of care to provide the safest and most effective treatment possible. As such, they must inform patients of the risks of the drugs they are prescribing. If they do not inform the patient, they must be liable for the damages. Furthermore, the health service should provide training to doctors about how to advise patients of the risks of drugs they prescribe, as well as the interaction with other drugs the patient is taking. Moreover, we feel that patients should be given the option to sign a disclaimer upon accepting medication. The disclaimer should state that they accept the risk, and that they will not sue the doctor if they suffer the consequences. However, if the patient is below the age of 18, the disclaimer should not be valid, as they are legally children, and should not be forced to accept the risk of any medication. If they are under the age of 18, they must accept that their parents or legal guardians will sign the disclaimer. This will prevent patients from suing doctors, and will ensure that patients are fully aware of the risks.”
