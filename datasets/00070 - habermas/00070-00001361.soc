# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a limit on the number of times a person can run for political office. The limit should be determined by the nature of the position and the person's performance in office.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the advantages of term limits outweigh the disadvantages. We believe that term limits can help to prevent corruption and reduce the risk of a cult of personality developing around a politician. We also believe that term limits can help to introduce new blood and new ideas into politics, which is important for a healthy democracy. However, we also believe that term limits can prevent a good politician from doing their job, which is a negative. We believe that term limits should be imposed on the most senior positions, such as the presidency or the prime ministership.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that there should be a limit on how many times a person can run for political office. This is to avoid the risk of cult of personality and to make sure that a political candidate cannot just rely on their popularity to get re-elected. It is also to ensure that new blood can be introduced into the political system which is not an unhealthy thing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is no simple, clear answer to this question. It is very subjective. However, we do believe that experience in political office can be useful, especially in a world where politics often involves long-term negotiation and relationship-building. Therefore, there should not be term limits for those who wish to make positive contributions. However, it is acknowledged that term limits may reduce corruption. It is therefore best that term limits are not enforced across the board but are rather case-dependent.
