# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes they should. We don't live in a perfect world, and corruption is commonplace. Rich and powerful individuals will always try to use their wealth and influence to ensure that politicians make decisions that are in their favour. We need laws to make sure that this doesn't happen. Political donations should be strictly limited and monitored to make sure that they don't distort the democratic process.  Conclusion This example shows that a group of participants with different views on an issue can come to a unanimous agreement on the way forward if they put aside their personal opinions and focus on the facts of the issue. The group came to the view that in a world where corruption is commonplace, legislation is required to ensure that the democratic process is not tainted by financial influence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of limiting the amount of money that a single person can give to political parties and candidates. The group felt that political donations are at the heart of political corruption, and that leaving political donations unchecked and unrestricted means that the wealthy elite in the country can influence politicians to pass laws that benefit them personally. The group felt that the government should step in to put an end to political corruption, and that a law should be passed to strictly limit the amount of money a person can give to political parties, and the amount should be very low.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “The UK government should pass a law to limit the quantity of money that a single person can give to political parties or candidates. The law should be strictly enforced and the limit should be very low to avoid any influence on politicians.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group came to the consensus view that a law should be passed to limit the amount of money that a single person can give to political parties or candidates.
