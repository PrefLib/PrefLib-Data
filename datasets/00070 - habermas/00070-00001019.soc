# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the decision that the current law should not be changed. This is because if the law is changed, the people that make movies, tv shows, music and software will lose out on money. Also, the people that are downloading the pirated content are not paying for the content so the people that made it are not getting any money for their hard work. If the law is changed, it will cause the companies that make these products to lose money and may result in them going out of business. This would mean that the people that work in these companies would lose their jobs. We think that the law should stay the same because it protects the people that make these products.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the current law should not be changed. We believe that this is because if people can get what they want for free then they will not be willing to pay for it. This will then lead to a decrease in revenue for the producers and they will not be able to make as many products. If this happens then the quality of the products will decrease and this will lead to less people buying the products. This will then lead to a decrease in revenue for the producers and they will not be able to make as many products.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that we should change the current law that says it is illegal to download pirated movies, TV shows, music, and software. We believe that this should be changed as it is a very harsh law and in some cases is not necessary. We feel that the law should be changed to reflect the fact that the law should be more lenient. We believe that the law should be changed as it is not necessary to make it illegal to download pirated content as it is not harming anyone and the companies involved are profiting from this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the current law should be changed to make it legal to download pirated movies, TV shows, music, and software. We believe that this is because it is often the case that the people that profit from pirated movies are linked to larger crime networks and this funds drugs and people trafficking etc. The genuine hardworking citizen is having less disposable income though so entertainment companies need to bear this in mind when making the legal ways to to view films, music, shows etc more affordable. Adding more ways to share subscriptions may help with this rather than looking unfavourably on this. We need to look at WHY people want this law changed and adapt the legal ways we share.
