# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should be more aggressive in its approach to global warming.  We are currently heading into a climate emergency at a rapid pace and the response from the government has been far too slow.  If we don't reverse harmful emissions quickly then it will be too late to save the planet from the effects of global warming, some of which we have already started to witness.  More subsidies for green energy, stricter controls on emissions and higher taxes on polluting industries should be brought in harder and faster. Participants that originally disagreed were brought round to accepting the final consensus statement.

The participants felt that this consensus view expressed the opinions of the majority of the group.  One participant felt very strongly that the group had come to the wrong consensus and the participants were not able to persuade this person to agree with the consensus view. The only participant to contribute no critiques or suggestions was a lawyer who was acting as the facilitator of the consensus seeking process.
