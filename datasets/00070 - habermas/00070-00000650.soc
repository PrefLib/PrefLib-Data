# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that GM foods are safe to eat. There is no evidence that they are harmful to humans or the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the conclusion that it is okay to eat genetically modified foods. We think that the risks are minimal and that the benefits of genetically modified food are great. This is because GM foods are highly resistant to pests, they have a better shelf life, they are more appealing to eat, and they have a similar nutritional value to non-GMO foods.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of GM foods. They all agreed that the potential benefits of GM foods outweighed any potential risks. They did however agree that the public should be fully informed of the potential risks involved.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that genetically modified foods are okay to eat as long as they are properly labeled and consumers are aware of what they are eating.
