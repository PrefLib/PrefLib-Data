# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of a limit to the number of consecutive terms a prime minister can serve. This is because it is important to give the public their rights to vote and to choose a leader and make changes where necessary. The UK election every 5 years gives the opportunity to reelect and choose a new PM. It is also to rid the opportunity of a bad PM. Like America an introduction to a two term serving would be a great example. Not only is the job of PM extremely stressful to have the same views and opinions and movements indefinitely is not progressive. It is also important to keep the system pumping in fresh, new ideas and to usher in younger generations who take onboard the old opinions and ways but bring forth fresh approaches to the government. If someone were to hold onto power for so long, it generally corrupts them and old, corruptive ways fester for a long time.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of a limit to the number of consecutive terms a prime minister can serve. This is to allow for fresh ideas and new approaches to be brought into government. The group was in favour of a two term limit as in the USA. This would allow a prime minister to serve two consecutive terms but would not allow them to serve a third consecutive term.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, there should not be a limit to the number of consecutive terms a prime minister can serve. If the people want to elect the prime minister again then that's their choice. The idea of a two term limit is a bit ridiculous.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes. We think that there should be a limit to the number of consecutive terms a Prime Minister can serve. This is because if a Prime Minister holds the position for a long period of time, they may start to become too relaxed and may stop doing their job as well as they should be. Also, in America, the President can only serve two terms and we think this is a good idea as it means that new, fresh ideas and people can come into power. Also, this means that there is a good turnover of people in the government which allows the public to feel like they are being listened to and represented by a variety of people.
