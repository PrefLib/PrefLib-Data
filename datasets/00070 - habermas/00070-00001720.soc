# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of using AI to make important decisions. The advantages to humanity of AI are to powerful not to use it in making important decisions but it has to be carefully managed so as not to have poor consequences. It helps in a vast range of areas such as health, economics, space science and so on. But it can also be a dangerous tool if used without regulation and care.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have to be cautious about using AI to make important decisions.  It's a relatively new tool that we are just getting to grips with.  We need to ensure that we don't set it free to make all the important decisions, because ultimately that would take away the right of humans to make their own choices and their own decisions.  It's a tool that should be used by humans to assist with important decisions, but we should not let it override the human conscience and that is why it is very important that AI decisions are well thought through, well researched and fully considered before being made.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool that has the potential to be extremely beneficial to humanity. It can help us in a vast range of areas such as health, economics, space science and so on. But it can also be a dangerous tool if used without regulation and care. It is still in relative infancy so as a society do we yet know all the permutations and consequences of AI?  How will it be managed and by whom?  I have to say I feel uneasy about it and I don't think it should be used to make important decisions.  That should be left to humans debating and considering all the consequences of their actions and decisions.
