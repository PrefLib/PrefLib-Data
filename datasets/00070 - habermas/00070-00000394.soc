# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “I believe that the current minimum wage is far too low for people to live on, with many people being reliant on food banks and relying on other sources to get by. Raising the minimum wage would be a good thing to do, however, it should be done in smaller amounts rather than in one big jump. This would allow businesses to get used to the new wage, and wouldn’t cause any to close down. I think that if the minimum wage was increased to £10 per hour, it would be a good starting point, and then this could slowly be raised over the next few years to keep up with the ever-growing cost of living.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the minimum wage is too low. However, a significant increase would put a lot of pressure on employers. This would be particularly hard on small business owners and social care providers. Unfortunately, we think an increase would result in many businesses closing, which would lead to unemployment. The issue is complicated and should be looked at as a matter of urgency.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is the opinion of the group that the minimum wage should be increased to £10/hr. This would help alleviate the current crisis in the UK with regards to people being unable to afford basic necessities such as food and heating. This would result in people spending more and thus more money would be injected into the economy, benefiting everyone in society. It would also help employers in terms of productivity as a wage of £10/hr would be a liveable wage, allowing people to live in reasonable accommodation with enough to eat and enough money to save, which would make them happier, more motivated and more productive. It would also help businesses who rely on manual labour as it would allow them to raise their prices to reflect the increase in wages.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the conclusion that the minimum wage should be raised and that there should be a certain limit to what the maximum wage is. There needs to be a balance between keeping the businesses running and the employees being paid enough to survive. The minimum wage does not keep up with the rise in cost of living, which is the main issue. Raising the minimum wage is a good idea but we need to be careful with how much it is raised.
