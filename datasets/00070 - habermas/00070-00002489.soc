# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The health benefits of fluoride in water outweigh the risks, however more research should be done to confirm this and the concentration of fluoride in water should be kept to a minimum to reduce any risks. People should also be given the choice to opt out of fluoride in their water if they wish to do so. The government should take more responsibility for the dental health of the nation, rather than relying on fluoride in water to solve the problem. Fluoride should not be added to bottled water as it is not necessary, and people are already paying for the water, so should not be expected to pay for fluoride as well.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “The addition of fluoride to the water supply is beneficial for the health of people's teeth, however it is not necessarily the most efficient way to ensure that people are getting the fluoride they need. The addition of fluoride to the water supply is an imposition on people's freedom of choice, and could potentially be dangerous for people who are allergic to fluoride, or for people who are drinking more water than they should. It is the responsibility of the government and healthcare system to ensure that people are getting the fluoride they need, and this should not be imposed on everyone. If people want fluoride in their water, they can choose to drink tap water. If they do not want fluoride in their water, they can choose to drink bottled water. This way, people are free to choose, and are not forced to consume fluoride.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, fluoride is beneficial for dental health. However, we feel that it should be up to the individual whether they want fluoride in their water or not. If they want fluoride, they should be able to get it from their dentist. If they don't want fluoride, they should be able to avoid it. We feel that it is the responsibility of the individual and the healthcare system to take care of dental hygiene, and it shouldn't be imposed on everyone without their consent. High levels of fluoride can be dangerous, plus we must consider potential allergies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of fluoride in the water. It was recognised that fluoride is a natural mineral that is present in many foods and drinks, including some tap water. It was noted that it can also be found in toothpaste, mouthwash and other dental products. The group recognised that fluoride can help to prevent tooth decay and cavities, but it can also be harmful in large doses. It was felt that fluoride in tap water was a positive step in promoting dental hygiene, but it should be accompanied by a greater awareness of the dangers of consuming too much fluoride.
