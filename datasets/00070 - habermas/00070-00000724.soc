# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Scotland should have the right to vote for independence if they wish. The decision should be left to the Scottish people. The union is not as important as it once was and if the people of Scotland want independence, that is what they should be able to have. They voted to remain in the EU and that was not reflected in what happened, which was unfair.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Scotland should be given the option to vote on independence, and if they vote to leave the UK, they should be allowed to do so. The referendum was a fair vote, and if the Scottish people want independence, they should be given it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Scotland should have the right to independence, but it would be better for them to remain in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is a strong country and Scotland has much to gain from staying in it. However, it is for the people of Scotland to decide and we should respect their right to decide their own future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of Scotland having independence if that is what the people of Scotland wish. They felt that the people of Scotland should be given the option to vote on their own independence and that if the majority of people in Scotland want independence, then that is what they should have. The participants felt that the people of Scotland should be allowed to make their own decision, and that the UK government should not try to influence the decision of the Scottish people.
