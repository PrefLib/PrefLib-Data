# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that we should ban single-use plastic bottles. These plastic bottles are very harmful to the environment and take a long time to break down naturally. They often end up in the sea where they can harm sea creatures and can cause harm to land-based wildlife. Many people are now using reusable bottles and would be glad to see single-use plastic bottles banned as it would make it even easier to make sure no single-use plastic bottles are used.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Single-use plastic bottles are causing harm to the environment. We should ban them. This would have a very positive effect on the environment and would not have a negative effect on us as humans.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should ban single-use plastic bottles. We are recycling lots of things now so plastic bottles no longer lie in a tip for year's. Bottles have many recycable properties and we have to use these as in all packaging. The group felt that it was very important to make the distinction between single-use plastics and other plastics. The group felt that it was important to emphasise that single-use plastics were very harmful to the environment, and get into our seas and rivers killing sea creatures, as well as being littered and hurting wildlife on land. The group felt that it was important to point out that single-use plastics take many years to break up naturally. The group felt that it was important to point out that there were many other options available now such as reusable water bottles. The group felt that it was important to point out that people had greatly adapted their ways of buying drinks with most people taking their own reusable water bottle with the wherever they go. The group felt that it was important to point out that to get the rest of the population to follow we need to remove the option to buy them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes, we should ban single-use plastic bottles. They do a lot of harm to the environment and we should do all we can to stop it.
