# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should do more to promote gender equality. There are still a lot of inequalities in the workplace, and the government could do more to promote equal pay for men and women, as well as working to ensure that there are more women in senior positions in business. There are also many countries around the world where women are treated unequally, and the government should work to support these women, and work to ensure that women's rights are respected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should do more to promote gender equality. It is important that gender equality is at the heart of all social, economic and political policy. It is the basis for a fair and functioning society. Every individual should has the same rights and be treated with respect on the basis of equality and equal opportunities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Gender equality is something that needs to be promoted in the government, and it is something that should be encouraged to continue. However, this should not be done at the expense of other important issues, such as those surrounding the economy and immigration.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should do more to promote gender equality. This is because the government is a powerful institution that can influence and set an example for the rest of society. This is especially important in the workplace and for younger generations, where it can be difficult to break the glass ceiling and to achieve equality.
