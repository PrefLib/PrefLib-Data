# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The body is a means by which we can prevent something from happening to others. We should not use it to block the way of another person for our own benefit or advantage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, it is not permissible to use your body to block another person's way as this is regarded as being very impolite and disrespectful. It is only permissible in some situations for protection of someone or yourself or to provide some important information to someone who is trying to get past.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is permissible to use your body to block another person's way when the intent behind it is not to harm, but to help or protect someone or something else. If you feel there is no good intent behind it, then it would be advisable to think twice before doing so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In principle it is never permissible to block another person’s path, however, in certain situations it is acceptable to use your body to block another’s way. This could be in situations where there is a danger to an individual or where the person who is being blocked is doing something wrong.
