# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Absolutely! Smoking is a horrible habit and should be banned completely. We do not need the youth of today taking up this habit, reducing their life and spending uncessary money.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: They should increase it without question. The younger a user gets into smoking, the easier it is for them to get addicted and stay addicted. Also an older person is less likely to be influenced by peer pressure. Smoking is bad for health without a doubt so the legal age should definitely be increased
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: At the risk of being unpopular, I'm still surprised it has not been banned from sale altogether. I agree with increasing the legal age for smoking, and as has been mentioned recently in the news, increasing every year, so that children today will never be able to smoke. It destroys lives, puts a burden on the NHS with the endless health problems it causes not only the smoker, but those around them who are forced to inhale second hand smoke.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I honestly don't know what the legal age is for smoking nowadays - I presume it is 18. If so, then it is difficult to increase that age, as legally you are then an adult and can take responsibility for your own actions. Otherwise cigarettes etc would have to classed as a drug, and therefore limited to access on prescription only. SO, if the legal age is below 18, I would support increasing it to 18.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I think it should be increased as there's no need for children - 16 year-olds - to be smoking. Increasing the legal age will make it harder to get hold of cigarettes. It will also reduce the number of smoking-related illnesses which will consequently have less of a burden on the healthcare system and economy.
