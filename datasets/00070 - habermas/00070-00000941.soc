# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “All drugs should be tested before they are licensed. This is to ensure that they are safe, effective and will not have any serious side effects. It is also to ensure that they will not interact with other medications. If they are not tested, it is possible that the drug could be harmful or ineffective. It is also possible that they could interact with other medications and cause serious health issues. It would be irresponsible to allow untested drugs onto the market. The tests should be rigorous and thorough to ensure that they are safe for the public to use.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “All drugs should be tested before they are licensed to ensure they are safe. The testing process will determine the side effects and risks associated with taking the drug. The testing process will also determine the correct dosage of the drug to ensure it is effective. If drugs are not tested before they are licensed, people will be exposed to unnecessary risks. The government has a duty of care to ensure that people are protected from harm and this includes ensuring that drugs are tested before they are licensed.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Yes, we should require that all drugs be tested before they are licensed to ensure they are safe. The public needs to be protected from any harm that could be caused by drugs. The testing of drugs is very important as it allows us to see what the effects of the drugs are, both good and bad. If drugs were not tested then people would be taking drugs that could cause harm to them and in some cases could even kill them. The testing of drugs is a very important process and should be required for all drugs that are sold to the public.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Yes, we should require that all drugs be tested before they are licensed to ensure they are safe. The consequences of not testing drugs could be catastrophic, with patients suffering from serious side effects, and even death. There are many examples of drugs that have caused major health problems and have been pulled from the market, such as Vioxx, which was used to treat arthritis. It was withdrawn in 2004 after it was linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. It is also possible that a drug may not be effective in its intended cure. All drugs should be tested to very high standards before they are put onto the market. This will ensure that the drug is safe and effective, and that it will not cause harm to patients.”
