# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - A carbon tax would help to reduce pollution, but the question is, what would be taxed, who would be taxed and how would this be determined. If a tax is to be imposed, it would need to be on individuals as well as businesses. If the burden of a tax is put on individuals, it could be detrimental to low income earners and even the middle classes, who will find it hard to absorb an extra tax. If the tax is imposed on businesses, it will be the end user who is going to feel the pinch, as they will have to pay higher prices for products.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although imposing a tax would be a good idea, it would be extremely difficult to come to a consensus on who the tax should be imposed on and who would actually end up paying it. We feel that by making the consumer aware of how much it costs to produce their goods, and the impact on the environment, would be a more effective way to address the issue. The use of renewable energy would be a better option than a tax as the reduction in CO2 emissions would not be as easy to see or feel as the tax would be. The question and responses above were taken from the Carbon Tax pages.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - A carbon tax should be imposed on frequent flyers. The tax should be high enough to deter people from flying and to encourage them to use alternative methods of transport such as trains and buses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In principle, the idea of a carbon tax is a good one as it forces people to reconsider their actions. In practice, however, there are many difficulties to overcome. The biggest problem is how to implement the tax. It would be very difficult to ensure that the tax is fair and that it does not affect those who are least able to afford it. It would also be very difficult to ensure that the tax is not just passed on to consumers, thus negating its effect. The government should not be the only body involved in this decision as it has many vested interests in different areas. It is also not clear who the tax should target - industry or private individuals.
