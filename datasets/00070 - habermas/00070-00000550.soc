# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The BBC should not be funded by a TV license but from general taxation. This is because, it is more fair to tax people based on what they use rather than taxing everyone in the country.  However, there was a lot of debate about whether to include a section of the group's opinions who believed that the BBC should be funded by subscription. The following view was therefore put forward for debate: The BBC should be funded by subscription. This is because, people should be responsible for the content they are choosing to watch and if they have to pay for it, they will be more accountable for their choices.  Participants thought that this statement had some value but that it did not consider the impact on the elderly. One participant made the argument that the elderly watch TV a lot and should not be deprived of it due to cost. This resulted in the final consensus view: The BBC should not be funded by a TV license but from general taxation. This is because, it is more fair to tax people based on what they use rather than taxing everyone in the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should have the option to either pay for the license or pay through general taxation. People who don't watch the BBC should not have to pay for a service they don't use. However, the BBC is something that we are all proud of and that is very British. Therefore, the BBC should be funded by the British public but this should be a choice and not enforced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - General tax is the best option. TV licence is outdated, people watch TV online and not just the BBC.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The BBC should be funded by general taxation and we should not be paying a TV license fee. The fee is outdated, and should be removed from everyone as it is too expensive and unfair on many pensioners. The BBC should be paid for from general taxation, however they should also use advertising as a form of income as well as other channels do. This would provide extra money and help fund the BBC for longer.
