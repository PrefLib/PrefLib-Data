# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the right to vote is an important part of being a UK citizen. However, we should not be forced to vote, as this would infringe on our freedom of choice. We should instead do more to encourage people to vote, and educate people on the importance of voting and the impact it has on our society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While voting is important, a democratic society should not force citizens to vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the current system is the best for our country, as it allows for those who are interested in politics to vote and those who are not to not vote. The current system allows for those who are interested to have their say and to have their voice heard, and for those who are not interested to not have to vote. This system is fair for all and allows for those who are interested to have their say.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - 'We believe that voting should be compulsory as it would increase the number of people who actually get involved in politics. This would allow more people to have a say in the government, which in turn would make the government more representative of the people and therefore a better system. However, this does come with the risk of individuals voting on topics they know nothing about, as voting for the first option they see is often easier than researching the political parties or opinions on the ballot. This is why we believe that the process of voting should be made more accessible to all, with political parties giving clear information on their website and social media and encouraging people to ask questions and get involved.'
