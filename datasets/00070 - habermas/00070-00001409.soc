# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Participants have different views about whether recreational use of marijuana should be legalized. Some think it should be legalized, others think it shouldn't be legalized. The group, however, reached a consensus that recreational use of marijuana should be legalized, after a good discussion about the pros and cons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the recreational use of marijuana should be legalised. It is a relatively safe drug, and is much less harmful than alcohol and cigarettes, both of which are legal. The legalisation of marijuana would also help combat the systemic racism that exists within the judicial system, people of colour are often the ones that are being incarcerated and punished for marijuana usage, even though it is something that people of every race do. The legalisation of marijuana would also help keep prison populations down (e.g. no people getting locked up for possessing marijuana for individual use) and so law enforcement can focus on more pressing matters. However, there are some important considerations that should be taken into account. For example, marijuana is a depressant and so may not be suitable for people with certain mental health conditions. Also, people may be more likely to try marijuana if it is legalised, and so the health effects of marijuana should be made clear to people, and it should be regulated in a way that prevents people from using it excessively.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The recreational use of marijuana should be legalised. It is a much safer drug than alcohol and it is currently possible to get much more intoxicated legally than would be the case if marijuana was legalised. Marijuana is also less likely to cause serious harm to the user or others than alcohol. Legalisation would also remove the criminal element from marijuana use and allow the law to focus on more serious crimes. Additionally, legalisation would be a significant step towards equality, as people of colour are disproportionately punished for the possession of marijuana. However, there would have to be regulations and age restrictions as to who can purchase marijuana and the amounts available, and there should be warnings for users of marijuana who are vulnerable to certain mental health conditions. Additionally, this is not to say that alcohol should be made illegal, this would cause more problems than it would solve.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of legalising marijuana for recreational use. However, there were some concerns about the potential for marijuana to be a gateway drug to harder drugs, and also concerns about the health effects of marijuana. The group felt that if marijuana was legalised, it should be tightly regulated, with the aim of preventing young people from accessing it, and also to prevent people from using marijuana to excess. The group also felt that people with certain mental health conditions should be advised not to use marijuana.
