# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus view: We believe that there should not be a complete ban on non-essential cosmetic surgery. In fact, it is difficult to define what ‘non-essential’ surgery is, as it is different for everyone. What may be considered to be ‘non-essential’ to one person may be essential to another.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should not be a complete ban on non-essential cosmetic surgery. In fact, it is difficult to define what ‘non-essential’ surgery is, as it is different for everyone. What may be considered to be ‘non-essential’ to one person may be essential to another. There is a big debate about what is cosmetic and what is essential surgery. In a way, all surgery is cosmetic, as there will be a change in appearance after surgery. We do believe though, that there should be a greater emphasis on the importance of psychological evaluation and counselling for anyone thinking about non-essential cosmetic surgery. Many people may choose such surgery because of body image issues, which in turn may have arisen from bullying. There are ways to treat low self-esteem other than non-essential cosmetic surgery. We feel that these other avenues should be explored and then surgery could be considered as a last resort.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Final consensus statement: We believe that there should not be a complete ban on non-essential cosmetic surgery. In fact, it is difficult to define what ‘non-essential’ surgery is, as it is different for everyone. What may be considered to be ‘non-essential’ to one person may be essential to another. There is a big debate about what is cosmetic and what is essential surgery. In a way, all surgery is cosmetic, as there will be a change in appearance after surgery. Therefore, it is even more crucial that people have an in depth psychological evaluation, counselling for low self-esteem issues, and other options explored before any such surgery is considered. These kinds of surgeries are undertaken for reasons that people sometimes do not take into consideration. Therefore, there should be counselling before any kind of surgery, to ensure that people do not have unrealistic expectations. This is also to protect the patient’s health. Such surgery should be viewed as a last resort, when nothing else has worked.
