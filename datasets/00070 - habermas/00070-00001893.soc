# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should re-join the EU so that we can take advantage of the trade benefits, including better prices on products and services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The United Kingdom is in a very difficult situation and does not appear to have a clear strategy or solution to how to deal with this situation. Brexit was a decision made by the previous UK Government with an aim of cutting ties with the European Union. However, in the time since Brexit has been pursued, it has become clear that there are many downsides to the decision to leave the European Union. While we have to respect the referendum and the results of the vote, we feel that the country was not given all the information that it needed to make an informed decision. We feel that the Government should re-assess its options and allow a second referendum to take place, so that the people can have another say on whether the UK should pursue membership of the European Union. We feel that a second referendum should be done as soon as possible to prevent any further damage to the country.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should not pursue membership of the European Union. We are better off making our own decisions. The European Union is a waste of money and the UK is better off without it. The decision to leave was the right one and should be respected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should absolutely pursue membership of the European Union.  The Brexit imposed on us by the UK Government has been an unmitigated disaster and we must get back to the way we were.  Boris Johnson lied to the electorate about the NHS. The UK economy is failing and growth and living standards are falling way behind other countries. Scotland did not vote for Brexit yet we have to feel the effect of it.
