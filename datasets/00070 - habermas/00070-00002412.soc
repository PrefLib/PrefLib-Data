# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of higher taxes on diesel vehicles.  The main argument for this was that diesel vehicles produce more harmful emissions than petrol vehicles, and so should be taxed more.  However, it was also argued that diesel vehicles are more fuel efficient than petrol vehicles, and so produce less emissions per mile.  The group felt that the current system of Vehicle Excise Duty (road tax) was not fit for purpose, and that a more effective system would be to tax vehicle owners based on the emissions of their vehicle.  This would encourage vehicle owners to maintain their vehicles to a high standard, and also encourage them to change their vehicle to one with lower emissions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of higher taxes on diesel vehicles. This is because diesel vehicles pollute more and contain chemicals more hazardous to human health. The group also felt that higher taxes on diesel vehicles would help to mitigate the use of diesels. However, the economic constraints this would have is more dangerous for the participants than the environmental damage it causes. Realistically, not as many people care about the environment, however everyone would care if they have to pay extra to use the car they love. The group also felt that taxes on vehicles should be based on actual emissions, this should be tested annually and then the owner taxed accordingly.  This is because a well maintained diesel engine may have fewer harmful emissions than a poorly maintained older petrol car.  Taxing vehicle owners in this way would encourage them to properly maintain their vehicle and also may encourage people with high emission vehicles to change them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of higher taxes on diesel vehicles. This is because diesel vehicles produce more pollution and are more harmful to the environment and human health. The group was also in favour of the taxes being based on the emissions of the vehicle, and not just on the type of fuel used. This is because not all diesel vehicles are the same and some produce less pollution than others. The group also suggested that the taxes be used to provide incentives for people to switch to more environmentally friendly vehicles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of higher taxes on diesel vehicles. The participants believed that the taxes would help to mitigate the use of diesels and would help to protect the environment. The participants also believed that the taxes would help to reduce carbon footprints. However, the participants were also in favour of the taxes being based on actual emissions, as this would be a fairer system. The participants also believed that the taxes should be tested annually and that this would encourage vehicle owners to properly maintain their vehicles. The participants also believed that the taxes would encourage people with high emission vehicles to change them. The participants also believed that the taxes would help to protect human health, as diesel vehicles contain chemicals which are hazardous to human health.
