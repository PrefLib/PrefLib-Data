# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There needs to be more incentives for individuals to purchase electric vehicles. While in the long term EVs are cheaper to run that traditional diesel/petrol cars, the upfront costs can be prohibitive to many people, especially considering that buying a second hand EV is next to impossible. Government grants would help in offsetting the costs of the car itself as well as installation of the charging port in homes. EVs can also be inconvenient to people in their every day life, thus people require even more incentive to switch from traditional cars. It is the government's responsibility to improve our environmental impact and subsidising EVs is an important way to do this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes. I think electric vehicles are one of the many ways that we need to go in order to help protect the environment which is an ever growing concern, alongside the effects that gas emissions are having on public health (i.e. those with lung conditions). However, cars, especially electric ones can be expensive and many aren't willing to go for an electric option when there are cheaper and worse alternatives available. Having subsidies available would promote the use of electric cars , hopefully improve any bad ideas being have about them not being suitable for their lifestyle and improve the enivornment and public health. This seems like a win for the government as it would have long-lasting beneficial effects. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, the government should subsidise electric vehicles at all stages: research, production and use across the UK. The government is not doing enough to support net-zero, it has stepped away from some of its own targets to do with this, yet is happy for households to be charged more to go about their daily work (via ULEZ roll-out etc).  The government should be offering grants and subsidies to companies to produce these vehicles, to households to buy and run them and to other companies / industries to use them and to provide charging points and back-up services (eg: battery manufacturers, bus companies etc).  We no longer have access to European innovation and funding in this area thanks to Brexit, so as the government who took us into that because they wanted the UK to stand alone are still in power, they should be stepping in to support this innovation, not just distancing themselves from the idea because it no longer suits them - and Brexit hasn't been what they wanted it to be!
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, as they have made promises to reduce carbon emissions and electric vehicles are an important swap if the targets are to be made. At the moment, Electric and Hybrid options are beyond the budget of many so a subsidy would stimulate sales and the increase in demand should bring down the cost longer term. Petrol and Diesel  cars have had their time but its naive to think people needing transport are all going to be able to swing over to the greener option without financial help. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - The government should more heavily subsidize electric vehicles. At the moment during this cost of living crisis, imposing more charges with the ULEZ scheme is creating more and more hardship for people. We all know diesel and petrol vehicles are bad for the planet but not everyone can afford to replace cars at the drop of a hat, and they certainly cant afford charges being imposed on them. If they were more heavily subsidized you will find more people inclined to change to electric. There needs to be more affordability offered to people
