# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a statutory requirement for schools to be open for a minimum number of days each year. The law would help working parents and help children to get the education they need. It would also help children to get into a routine and learn about the world of work. The law would also help to keep children safe and off the streets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe there should be a statutory requirement for schools to be open for a minimum number of days each year. Children learn a lot at school and it is vital that they get as much education as possible. By having the schools open, it means that children will get a better education and hopefully achieve better results and grades. This is essential as it will allow the child to get a better job when they are older. It also means that parents can work and provide for their families.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Schools should be open a minimum of 190 days a year. This is to allow for more structured and consistent learning. There should also be a statutory requirement for schools to be open 5 days a week. Children learn better when they have a routine and structure in their week.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In conclusion, the group of participants have come to the consensus view that there should be a statutory requirement for schools to be open for a minimum number of days each year. The group of participants believe that this is because children need consistency and structure in their lives and without this, they will not be able to learn to the best of their ability. The group of participants also believe that the statutory requirement will help working parents as the cost of childcare is very expensive. The group of participants also believe that children will lose out on months and months of education if schools are not open for the minimum number of days each year.
