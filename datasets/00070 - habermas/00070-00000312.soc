# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The Government should provide more support to parents to help children from poorer families achieve in school, but this support must be tailored in a way that is beneficial to the child and not just to the family as a whole.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that the government should provide greater support to parents of children from poorer families, however we also believe that it is the responsibility of the parents to ensure that their children are motivated to achieve in school. We believe that some support should be available for after school care for these children, as this would allow them to spend more time completing their homework. This support should not be taken advantage of by parents who could afford to support their children, and only parents with children of exceptional need should be given this support. Conclusion: Whilst there was not a consensus view on whether the government should provide greater support to parents of children from poorer families, we came to the conclusion that if this support is given, it should be given in a targeted manner.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the government should provide greater support to help children from poorer families achieve in school. In doing so, children are set up for a more successful future which will help reduce inequality in society. However, it is ultimately the individual child's choice to make the effort required in order to perform well in school, and therefore the level of support is somewhat limited.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should provide greater support to parents to help children from poorer families achieve in school.
