# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of funding the arts. The main argument for was that the arts bring a great deal of tourism to the country, especially in places like Stratford where Shakespeare is performed and the house he lived in is preserved. The funding is also important for education. The main argument against was that the government should be funding more important things like health and education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The arts are important to the society and to the economy. They create jobs, increase tourism and provide an outlet for creativity. The government should fund the arts, but not to the detriment of other important sectors of the economy.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the government funding the arts. The group felt that it is a profession and if there isn't enough money coming in, it could be lost. The group also felt that it brings a lot of tourism to the UK, so is beneficial to retain it. The group also felt that it is an important part of humanity and without arts, the society will be a different place - likely worse. The promotion of arts encourages designs and developments that soothes people's mental and behavioural health. It creates a feeling of completeness and ability to make improvements. The promotion of arts is influential in the design of our modern streets and the beauty we enjoy in our cities. The society will not continue without the arts, basically.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group came to the consensus view that the government should fund the arts. This is because it brings a lot of tourism to the country and helps the economy. It also helps with creativity in young children. Some participants also thought that it could bring a lot of beauty and happiness to the country. However, the group had to compromise by not stating what the amount of money the government should put into arts.
