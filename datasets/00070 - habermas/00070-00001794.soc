# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of legalising cannabis. The primary argument was that the current laws are not working and are in fact making the situation worse. The laws are not preventing people from using cannabis, and are in fact creating a black market which is more dangerous. The laws are also creating a situation where cannabis is more dangerous as it is not regulated. The laws are also creating a situation where cannabis is more dangerous as it is not regulated.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Recreational cannabis should be legalised. The reduction in 'antisocial' drug-dealing would cease, it would allow the state to control and have an overview of its use, tax could be generated and wider-societal benefits such as reduced crime and courts input would lead to improved justice on other more important areas for the betterment of society. Furthermore, people whom use cannabis use it anyway irrespective of whether it is legal or not - but if the state were involved, parents could have an input and the impact upon society would be significant. In countries where it is legal - or states in the USA - the benefits for wider-society are significant and the savings on the criminal justice system have been widespread.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Cannabis should be legalised for medical purposes. It should be used as a substitute to many of the other drugs on the market and should be legalised in the same manner as these. The consensus was also that cannabis should be legalised for recreational purposes. The main justification was that if it is legalised then the government can tax it, allowing for less 'antisocial' drug dealing. A lot of money can be made and taxed to the benefit of wider society. If cannabis is to be legalised, it should be legalised in the same manner as tobacco and alcohol. However, the group did not agree that people should be able to sell it from their homes like alcohol, but rather that it should be sold in similar places to tobacco.
