# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We don't believe that the NHS should be funded by a national tax on food. We believe this because food is an essential item, so it would not be fair for the tax to be put on that. Instead we believe that a better way to fund the NHS would be through taxing the unhealthy food. It is also important that the NHS be funded by a tax that is applied to everyone, instead of only to a certain group of people. We believe that taxing the unhealthy food would be a fairer way of funding the NHS, because it would provide the people with an incentive to eat healthier. Taxing food that is not healthy is a fairer way to fund the NHS because it will be applied to all people. Therefore it would be better than taxing food, which would be only applied to the people that can afford to buy food.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, the NHS should not be funded by a national tax on food, instead of income tax. The NHS should be funded by income tax as it is fairer for all and everyone has to pay it if they are elgible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of funding the NHS through a food tax.  The group felt that this would be unfair, as some people would be unable to afford food.  The group also felt that this would be an ineffective way of funding the NHS, as people would simply stop buying food, and the tax would not raise enough money.  The group felt that the current system of income tax was fairer, as everyone has to pay it.  The group also felt that the current system was more effective, as it is easier to collect the tax.  However, the group did feel that it would be a good idea to tax unhealthy food, such as crisps and chocolate, to try and reduce obesity.  The group felt that this would be a good way of funding the NHS, as it would help to reduce the number of people who need treatment.  The group also felt that this would be a fairer way of funding the NHS, as it would only affect people who buy unhealthy food.  The group felt that it would be more effective, as it would encourage people to buy healthy food, which would help to reduce the number of people who need treatment.
