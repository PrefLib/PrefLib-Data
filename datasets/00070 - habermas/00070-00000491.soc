# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the decision that the government should not set a minimum price for alcohol. We feel that people should be allowed to spend their money how they want and that the government should not take control of that. The government should also not treat alcohol differently to any other product. If a person wants to buy cheap alcohol, it should be their choice to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of setting a minimum price for alcohol. We feel that this is a good idea as it will tackle the many problems that alcohol brings to society. However, we feel that it would not be realistic to set this minimum price too high, as this would create a black market and would therefore make it more difficult for the government to control. We also feel that the minimum price should be set to reflect the cost of the alcohol rather than the alcohol content, as this would not cause a major increase in the price of more expensive alcohols.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, the government should not set a minimum price for alcohol.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although in theory setting a minimum price for alcohol could help to target alcoholism and binge drinking. This could help to target the issues caused by alcoholism and binge drinking in wider society, for example anti-social behaviour. It could also help to reduce teen-drinking as cheap alcohol would not be accessible. However, we believe this would need extensive research to prove the effect of minimum prices before it would be accepted by the public as a strategy.
