# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Science and research is vital for us to advance as a society. If we invest more in science and research, we will be able to develop new drugs and cures for deadly diseases, new technologies and inventions which will improve our economy and jobs. Science and research will also help us combat climate change, improve the environment, find cures for disease and help us all live longer. Social services are very important and we do need to invest in them, but we already spend a lot of money on them and it is unlikely that we will be able to cut the amount of people who are homeless, living in poverty, or who have an addiction. If we invest more in science and research we can help find a cure for addiction, or find a way to stop people from being homeless. We can improve the quality of social services by investing more in science and research.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that we should invest the same amount in science and research as we do in social services. Both areas are important and crucial to the functioning of society and to the lives of citizens. Science and research will help us in the future as we will have a better understanding of things and we will have better medicine and other technologies. Social services will help the most vulnerable people in society to have better lives and to feel more safe. They will also give them a better understanding of things such as how to live independently, how to manage their money and how to socialise with people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should invest equally in both science and research and social services.  Both are very important to us at different times of our lives.  Science and research obviously help in the future but social services helps people in need straight away as its needed.  Social services is really important its how we support the most vulnerable people in society.  Investing in socail services would have a massive impact upon the lives of countless people in our society.  By investing in these areas we can uplift disadvantaged parts of society.  Strong social services can lead to better outcomes for everyone in our society.  As much as i feel that the social services group in the uk is not of the best quality, i think science and research will have a greater impact on the uk and can possibly improve every ones daily lives.  Science and research can also help with things such as cures for viruses and illnesses along with new technology.  It can also help with climate change and the argument on everything turning electric.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “We believe that science and research is very important to the future of our society.  However, we also believe that social services are very important and should not be forgotten.  We feel that we should invest in both science and research and social services.  The two are not mutually exclusive and we can invest in both.  We believe that the two can work hand in hand and help each other.  We believe that we should invest in both science and research and social services equally.”
