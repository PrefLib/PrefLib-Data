# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections. It was felt that the more people who are involved in the democratic process, the better. It was also felt that the more people who are involved in the democratic process, the more likely it is that the democratic process will be robust and fair. However, it was felt that it would be necessary to put some safeguards in place. For example, it was felt that non-UK citizens should be required to have lived in the UK for a certain period of time before being allowed to vote. It was also felt that non-UK citizens should be required to have paid taxes in the UK for a certain period of time before being allowed to vote. It was felt that these safeguards would help to ensure that non-UK citizens would have a vested interest in the UK and would help to ensure that non-UK citizens would have a good understanding of the UK. It was also felt that these safeguards would help to ensure that non-UK citizens would not be able to vote in a way that would undermine the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections. The group felt that this would promote community cohesion and an inclusive society for everyone. The group also felt that this would be a good way to promote integration of non-UK citizens into the local community. The group did feel that there would be a need for strict rules for how this would work. The group felt that there would be a need for a residency requirement and that this would need to be long enough to ensure that the non-UK citizen has a vested interest in the wellbeing of the UK. The group felt that the non-UK citizen would also need to have paid taxes in the UK for a certain period of time.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections. It was felt that this would promote community cohesion and inclusion, and that the people who live in an area should have a say in how it is run. It was also felt that non-UK citizens would have as much of a vested interest in the wellbeing of the UK as UK citizens. The group did however acknowledge that there would need to be strict rules in place to ensure that non-UK citizens were not voting fraudulently, and that there would need to be a minimum time period that a non-UK citizen would need to have lived in the UK before being allowed to vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections. It was felt that this would be a positive step towards creating a more inclusive society, where everyone is valued and has a say in how things are run. The group also felt that non-UK citizens would be more in touch with UK citizens than those in government and would therefore be more likely to make the right decisions for the community. However, it was also felt that there would need to be strict rules in place to ensure that only those who have lived in the UK for a certain amount of time would be allowed to vote. This would ensure that those who vote are more likely to have a vested interest in the wellbeing of the UK.
