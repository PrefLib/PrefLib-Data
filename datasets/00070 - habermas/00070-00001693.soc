# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of keeping the monarchy. They all agreed that the royal family has a large part to play in UK tourism and is a large part of the countries history and tradition. They also agreed that the royal family is becoming more in line with modern times, and are taking on more duties that are more relevant to the current climate. The group also agreed that the royal family are a large part of the countries identity and are something that we should be proud of. The group did not agree that the royal family are a drain on the system and that they do not serve the country. They felt that the royal family do a lot of work for the country and that they are an important part of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although the monarchy is a big part of British history and tradition, it is a large cost to the country and is not representative of modern day Britain. Therefore, the monarchy should not be kept.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe the monarchy is something the UK should be proud of and we think it should be kept. The monarchy has provided a sense of continuity and tradition that transcends politics, and it is a big part of British culture and tradition. Many other countries also love it, and wish they had something similar. It also has a positive economic impact on the UK. However, we believe there are some ways the monarchy can be improved. They should be less extravagant, to represent modern times, and they should reduce their use of personal expense, such as helicopter travel, when public transport is available.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should keep the monarchy.
