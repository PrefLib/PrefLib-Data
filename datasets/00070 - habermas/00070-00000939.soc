# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should introduce a 5% sugar tax on soft drinks. The tax would be an effective way of reducing the consumption of sugary drinks and as a result would help to tackle obesity. The tax would be especially beneficial for the younger generation and those on low incomes. The tax would be a great way of raising money for the NHS as they are currently facing a large deficit. The tax would also be a great way of raising money for other services such as education. The tax would be a good way of educating people about the dangers of consuming too much sugar.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that a sugar tax should be introduced on soft drinks as it will make people think twice about consuming them. If the prices are increased, then people will be more likely to choose a healthier option. The tax generated from this can be used for other services such as the NHS, where wages are low for nurses. The tax can also be used to lower the price of fruit and vegetables to help combat obesity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “Yes, we should introduce a 5% sugar tax on soft drinks because sugar is a known food stuff. It is good for short term, fast energy but bad for our long term health. Sugar is bad for our teeth, bad for our waist lines and bad for any child's attention span. Sugar is cheap and is added to so so many foods: carbonated drinks, sandwich fillers, pizzas, cooking sauces, bread, sauces, and even 'healthy' fruit-based drinks. We need to introduce a 5% sugar tax and children and the obesity crisis, requires us to. We have long had the 5 pieces of fruit or veg a day message but its not being acted upon, its not getting through especially to the poor. We need to introduce this tax to reduce the price of fruit and veg for the poor in society and help pay for the NHS which has to pick up the pieces when sugar-riddled children end up needing weight-loss surgery. Its that serious.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of introducing a sugar tax on soft drinks. It was agreed that it would discourage the consumption of sugary drinks and encourage people to switch to healthier options. The group also agreed that the tax would help to reduce the rate of obesity in the country, which would in turn reduce the burden on the NHS. The group also agreed that the tax would be beneficial to the economy, as the revenue generated could be used to fund other services such as the NHS. However, it was also noted that the tax would be unfair to those on lower incomes, as they would be less likely to be able to afford the tax and would therefore be more likely to continue to consume sugary drinks. The group also agreed that the tax would be unfair to the companies that produce the drinks, as they would be forced to increase the price of their products. The group also agreed that the tax would not be an effective way of reducing the rate of obesity, as it would not reduce the consumption of sugary foods.
