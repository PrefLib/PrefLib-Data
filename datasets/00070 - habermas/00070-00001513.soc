# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Baby-led weaning is something that many parents of young children are exploring and it has become quite common these days. It is important that parents/carers do enough research to understand how to use baby-led weaning properly. Traditional spoon-feeding has been standard practice for a number of years, so it's important to stay well informed with regards to new developments and what the current research suggests is best. Spoon-feeding allows food intake to be controlled and mean nutritional intake can be planned/tracked, and it has a lower choking risk. Baby-led weaning lets babies self-regulate, get stuck in with developing motor skills and means that they can have a lot of variety although it does also usually mean that there will be a lot of mess that will need cleaning up afterwards. Ultimately, it should be up to the parents to decide which method to use, after gaining advice from health care advisors, friends and family, as well as the reaction from the baby. At the end of the day, It is the welfare of the baby that is paramount, so whichever method the baby thrives on could be the method chosen.
