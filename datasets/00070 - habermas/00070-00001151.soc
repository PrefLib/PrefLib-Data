# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Research findings should be published as it is important to test the boundaries of knowledge.  Contradictory and false findings can be used as an opportunity to improve the design and scope of research.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Research findings should be published, even if they might be false or contradictory to established science.  It is important to establish the facts in any scientific research.  The research findings will be rigorously peer-reviewed before publication and any false findings will be identified and removed.  It is important that all findings are published, even if they are contradictory to established science, because it is only through publishing all findings that the scientific community can be sure that the established science is correct.  Publishing all findings also allows the scientific community to explore all avenues of research, which may lead to new and exciting discoveries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Research findings should be published as long as they have been well-researched and are supported by a valid theory. There should be an element of peer review to verify that the research findings are reliable. If the research is contradictory to established science, it should be published so that it can be reviewed by others in the scientific community.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the findings of research should be published. It is important that the scientific community is aware of all research, even if it is contradictory to established science. This will allow for a greater understanding of the topic and will also allow for further research to be conducted. It is also important that all research is conducted in a rigorous manner, with appropriate controls and is peer-reviewed before publication.
