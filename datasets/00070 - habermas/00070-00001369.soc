# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, fast food chains should not be banned from operating near schools. Instead, fast food chains should be encouraged, and if necessary required if near a school, to place healthier items on their menus. This helps to mitigate the impact of their operation near schools and the purchase of items by school-aged children and teenagers, and the associated health impacts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that fast food chains should not be banned from operating near schools. Whilst fast food is unhealthy and can lead to obesity and other health problems, we believe that it is the responsibility of parents to educate their children as to why fast food is unhealthy and ultimately exert their power to either buy it for the child or not. It is also the responsibility of the fast food chains themselves to provide healthier options on their menus and encourage healthy eating.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While the unhealthy effects of fast food is well-known, there are significant flaws in a policy which would seek to ban fast food chains from operating near schools. Banning fast food chains from operating near schools is not likely to have the desired effect as the majority of children will continue to access it via different means, namely travelling further or from home. Banning fast food chains from operating near schools is an unnecessary overreach and limits freedom of choice for those who aren't children. Additionally, we must remember that the onus is not on policy to provide children with what is best for them, but rather on parents. A responsible parent would educate their child on the health risks associated with fast food and do their best to avoid it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Fast food chains should not be banned from operating near schools. Whilst there is certainly an argument that the potential harm caused by operating near schools outweighs any possible benefit, we feel that there is no need for such an overreach of authority. Parents, who have the primary responsibility for a child's health, can educate their children about the dangers of fast food, and help them to make healthy choices.
