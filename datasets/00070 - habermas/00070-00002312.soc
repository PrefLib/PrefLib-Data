# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The price of prescription drugs should be capped to a reasonable level. This is to make sure that everyone can afford the drugs that they need to be able to live a healthy life. This is especially important for people who have long-term illnesses or health conditions, as they will have to take these drugs for a long time. The price of drugs should not be set too high, as this can make them unaffordable for the people who need them. This can also cause people to buy their drugs from illegal sources, which can be dangerous. However, the price of drugs should not be set too low either, as this can make it difficult for pharmaceutical companies to make a profit. If this happens, then there is less incentive for pharmaceutical companies to produce new drugs. This can make it more difficult for people to access new and innovative drugs in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the price of prescription drugs should be capped. The price of prescription drugs is getting ever more expensive and the cost of living is rising rapidly.  People genuinely cannot afford to buy necessary drugs anymore especially on repeat prescription.  Therefore I definitely think that the price of drugs should be capped to make them as affordable as possible for people who rely on them for their welfare.  However, the price of prescription drugs is dependent on the supply and demand of said drugs and the price of some drugs may fluctuate more than others.  Therefore, it is not a simple yes or no answer to this question.  It is a very complicated issue.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “The price of prescription drugs should be capped. This is because it is important that people are able to afford the drugs that they need. This is especially important for drugs that people need to take on a regular basis. However, it is important to note that the price of drugs is often high because of the cost of research and development, and the cost of production. This means that it is important to find a balance between making drugs affordable and making sure that pharmaceutical companies can still make a profit. This is because if pharmaceutical companies cannot make a profit, then they will not be able to invest in the research and development of new drugs. This would be detrimental to the health of people in the future. However, it is important to note that many pharmaceutical companies price gauge because of greed and wanting to maximize profits rather than investing in research and development. This should be stopped. Capping the price could help with this. It is also important to note that many pharmaceutical companies make enormous profits already. Therefore, if capping the price of drugs does result in less money for pharmaceutical companies, then this should be seen as a necessary sacrifice in order to ensure that the people who need drugs are able to afford them.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The price of prescription drugs should be capped. This is because it is important that people are able to afford the drugs that they need. This is especially important for drugs that people need to take on a regular basis. However, it is important to note that the price of drugs is often high because of the cost of research and development, and the cost of production. This means that it is important to find a balance between making drugs affordable and making sure that pharmaceutical companies can still make a profit. This is because if pharmaceutical companies cannot make a profit, then they will not be able to invest in the research and development of new drugs. This would be detrimental to the health of people in the future. We believe that this balance should be struck by making sure that the price of prescription drugs is as low as possible. However, we also believe that the cost of drugs should be made up for by the government, and not by the consumer. This would ensure that people are able to afford the drugs that they need, while also making sure that pharmaceutical companies are able to make a profit and invest in the research and development of new drugs.”
