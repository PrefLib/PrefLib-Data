# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The European Union has enabled closer working between countries within Europe and has facilitated peace within the region. It also enables countries to benefit from the free movement of goods, services and people, giving businesses and individuals more opportunities in trade and personal lives. The UK leaving Europe, Brexit, has shown the immense damage that is caused to a country and its citizens by leaving its neighbouring trading block. Opportunities have been lost, trade negatively impacted, individuals have lost their freedoms and are in danger of losing many of the rights, such as employment rights and environmental standards. Whilst the European Union not be perfect , being within it is much more preferable than going alone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The EU has been the source of peace in Europe for over 70 years. It is the world's largest trading bloc and in the current global climate, it is the only alliance that is on par with the US or China either militarily or economically. The UK leaving the EU, Brexit, has shown the immense damage that is caused to a country and its citizens by leaving its neighbouring trading block. Opportunities have been lost, trade negatively impacted, individuals have lost their freedoms and are in danger of losing many of the rights, such as employment rights and environmental standards. Whilst the European Union not be perfect , being within it is much more preferable than going alone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We think that the EU is the biggest exporter in the world with 500 million people. It is very important to support the EU as it is one of the biggest trading blocs in the world. The EU is an alliance of 27 member countries in Europe that promotes and develops shared economic, social, cultural, and political values, forming the world's largest trading bloc.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should continue to support the European Union as it provides countries within the EU with a host of benefits such as improved environmental standards and free movement of people. Whilst the EU is far from perfect and is a very bureaucratic organisation, it is the best option for countries that want to be a part of the single market and is the only alliance that can rival the United States of America.
