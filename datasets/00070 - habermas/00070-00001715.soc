# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of incentivising people to recycle, but not necessarily by paying them to do so. Some people may feel that they should be rewarded for recycling, but others may feel that it is their duty as a citizen to do so. Some may even feel that they should be rewarded for not recycling. The group felt that people should not be penalised for not recycling, as this may cause resentment. It may be better to incentivise people to recycle, for example by providing them with a discount on their council tax. The group also felt that the government should be more transparent about what happens to the recycling that people provide. The group felt that if people knew that their recycling was being used to make a positive difference, they would be more likely to recycle.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is a good idea to incentivise people to recycle, for example by providing them with a discount on their council tax. However, it is important that the benefits of recycling are explained to people, so that they are aware that their recycling is being used to make a positive difference. People may be discouraged from recycling if they feel it is merely being ignored. Public Perspective Group
