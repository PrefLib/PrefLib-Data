# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the move to more sustainable energy sources is likely to make a real difference to global warming. However, it is a global issue and requires a global effort. The influence of global warming on everyday life is already here and it is essential to develop and implement sustainable energy sources. The move to more sustainable energy sources is necessary if humanity is to try to mitigate the climate change influences. The move to more sustainable energy sources is not something that will happen overnight and requires the world's population to all play their part. The move to more sustainable energy sources is not something that will happen overnight and requires the world's population to all play their part. This move will require the development and implementation of sustainable energy sources such as nuclear energy, solar energy, hydro energy, geothermal energy, etc.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The move to more sustainable energy sources is necessary if humanity is to try to mitigate the climate change influences. It is a global issue and requires a global effort. It is a long term project and requires the world's population to all play their part. The participants who took part in the debate were then asked to rate their own opinion, the opinions of the other participants, the draft consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement, and the final consensus statement in terms of how well each one reflected their own opinion. The results are presented in
