# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should be allowed to use the internet as they wish, however parents should have some control over the content that they access. This can be done through the use of parental controls. The Internet has become an important part of modern society and it is essential that children are allowed to use it to its full potential. This can be done by allowing children to access the internet as they wish, however parents should have some control over the content that they access. This can be done through the use of parental controls.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “Parents should not be allowed to forbid their children from using the Internet. The internet is an essential tool for learning and education. It is also a good source of leisure activities. Parents should however ensure that children are accessing age appropriate materials. Parental controls should be used to ensure that children are accessing only the content that is appropriate to their age.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No parents should not be allowed to forbid their children from using the internet. The internet is the greatest source of knowledge available and can be essential as a tool for the education of children. As well as education there are benefits such as relaxing by watching films or tv series, playing games or just general surfing. Parents should always have insight into what their children are doing on the internet, and ultimately as they pay for the internet they get a say into how this is used. However this should be balanced with the age of the child and whether this restriction is necessary and good for their social wellbeing. For example, a teenage child would find this restriction more harmful than a much younger child.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the internet is a great source of information and a great way to socialise with friends. However, there are some risks to using the internet and parents are best placed to judge what is appropriate for their child. We feel that in general parents should not forbid their children from using the internet. However, there may be situations where this is appropriate, for example if the child is very young or if the parent feels the child is at risk from certain content.
