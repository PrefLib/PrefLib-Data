# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People earning more than £250,000 should be taxed at a higher rate because they are already in a very fortunate situation. Any increase in their tax rate would still enable them to live comfortably and to take home the majority of their earnings, while still paying a fair amount of tax. This is in line with the social justice principle of progressive taxation, where the more you earn, the higher your tax rate should be. Anyone making over £250,000 is already living extremely comfortably and can most certainly afford a higher tax rate that would assist in lifting up the lives of millions of workers who were born into situations that left them trapped in low-paying jobs.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Final consensus statement: People earning more than £250,000 should be taxed at a higher rate because they are already in a very fortunate situation. The small incremental increase in their tax rate would still enable them to live comfortably and to take home the majority of their earnings, while still paying a fair amount of tax. This is in line with the social justice principle of progressive taxation, where the more you earn, the higher your tax rate should be. Anyone making over £250,000 is already living extremely comfortably and can most certainly afford a higher tax rate that would assist in lifting up the lives of millions of workers who were born into situations that left them trapped in low-paying or unskilled jobs.
