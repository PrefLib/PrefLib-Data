# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK’s high national debt is a cause for concern. This is because it is increasing every year and this will mean that the UK will be in debt for a long time. This will mean that the government will have to pay a lot of money back and this will mean that taxes will increase. This will mean that the cost of living will increase and this will mean that the worse off families will be struggling. This will mean that they will be living in poverty and this will mean that they will be struggling to get food and other necessities. This will mean that the worse off families will be struggling and this will mean that the worse off families will be struggling.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It was agreed that the UK’s high national debt is a cause for concern for many reasons. For one, the cost of living in the UK is on the rise due to the increase of prices of necessities such as food and petrol. This is caused by the fact that the Government is printing out more money in order to keep the country going, and in doing so, the value of the money becomes devalued. In addition, the group of participants agreed that it is unfair for the lower income families and individuals who are most affected by this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK’s high national debt is a cause for concern, but it is not the only problem facing the country. The government needs to focus on the way it handles finances internally, and make sure that it does not print out too much money, which would drive up inflation. The government also needs to make sure that it does not increase the cost of living too much, as this would make life very difficult for the poorest families in the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK’s high national debt is a cause for concern. This is because although we are in the right to print money in order to help our economy, the increased inflation rate is detrimental to us. It makes it more difficult for people to live their daily lives and also causes more poverty in the UK.
