# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of restricting the number of people entering the UK from other countries. This is because of the strain that is put on public services such as the NHS and also the housing crisis that is currently affecting the UK. However, the group was also in favour of allowing people from third world countries to come to the UK as the UK is a very developed country with many opportunities for people to live a good life. The group was also in favour of allowing people to come to the UK to escape violence in their home countries. The group also discussed the issue of illegal immigrants coming to the UK and the group was in favour of allowing illegal immigrants to stay in the UK if they have been here for a long time and have contributed to the UK in a positive way. The group also discussed the issue of Brexit and the group was in favour of allowing people from the EU to continue to come to the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of limiting the number of people entering the UK. The participants felt that there are many people in the UK that are not getting the support they need and so this should be a priority. The participants also felt that the country is becoming overcrowded and so this is also a problem. However, the participants also felt that the UK has a moral responsibility to help people who are living in terrible conditions and so there should be some form of compromise.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of restricting the number of people that can enter the UK from other countries. The main reasons for this were that the country is already overcrowded, that it would help reduce crime rates, and that it would help the NHS cope better. However, the group also recognised that there are benefits to having migrants in the UK, such as the fact that they are often willing to work in industries that many British people are not. The group also recognised that it is more ethical to allow people to shelter from violence within their home countries. The group was therefore in favour of having some sort of limit, but not an absolute ban.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of restricting the number of people entering the UK from other countries. The group felt that this would help to alleviate the strain on public services and help to ensure that everyone in the UK has a good quality of life. However, the group also felt that it was important to allow people to enter the UK from countries that are experiencing violence and conflict. The group felt that this would be more ethical and would also help to improve the UK's image as a country that is willing to help those in need.
