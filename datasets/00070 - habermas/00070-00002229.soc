# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not wrong to eat meat. Although the way in which meat is reared is often very cruel and not sustainable, meat can provide us with a large amount of nutrients that can benefit our health and so therefore it is okay to eat meat. However, people who choose not to eat meat are not doing anything wrong. It is just a personal choice that people make and people have a right to choose what they want to eat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the consumption of meat. They felt that humans are designed to eat meat, and that it is not wrong to do so. However, they felt that the way in which meat is produced and processed is not sustainable and that animals are not treated well enough. The group felt that the way in which meat is produced and processed needs to change in order to be more sustainable. They also felt that it is a personal choice and that it is not wrong to eat meat, but that it is also not wrong to be vegan.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is not wrong to eat meat. The treatment of animals and where they are reared is more important than the act of eating meat itself.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of eating meat. However, the group was in favour of eating meat in a more sustainable way, and to a lesser extent than we currently do. The group was in favour of the way in which animals are treated, and thought that the way in which they are currently treated is not acceptable. The group was in favour of the idea that humans are designed to eat meat, but thought that we do over consume by a large amount. The group was in favour of the idea that the way in which meat is now reared and processed is not sustainable and a lot of the animals are not treated well enough. However, the group was in favour of the idea that animals need to be treated in the most humane way possible.
