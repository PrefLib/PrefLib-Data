# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that non-essential plastics should be banned from supermarkets. This is because these plastics are not essential to the product and therefore are an unnecessary addition to the product and a waste of plastic. These plastics also often end up in landfill and the oceans where they can harm marine life. The removal of these non-essential plastics will also help consumers to be more mindful of the environmental impact of their purchases and promote a culture of sustainability.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that non-essential plastics should be banned from supermarkets. This is because these plastics are not essential to the product and therefore are an unnecessary addition to the product and a waste of plastic. These plastics also often end up in landfill and the oceans where they can harm marine life. The removal of these non-essential plastics will also help consumers to be more mindful of the environmental impact of their purchases and promote a culture of sustainability. We also think that there needs to be a reform of the plastics that are deemed essential, so they can be identified easily and recycled properly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that non-essential plastics should be banned from supermarkets. This is because these plastics are not essential to the product and therefore are an unnecessary addition to the product and a waste of plastic. These plastics often end up in landfill and the oceans where they can harm marine life. The removal of these non-essential plastics will also help consumers to be more mindful of the environmental impact of their purchases and promote a culture of sustainability. If plastic is essential, it should be easily identifiable so it can be recycled easily.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that non-essential plastics should be banned from supermarkets. This is because these plastics are not essential to the product and therefore are an unnecessary addition to the product and a waste of plastic. These plastics also often end up in landfill and the oceans where they can harm marine life. The removal of these non-essential plastics will also help consumers to be more mindful of the environmental impact of their purchases and promote a culture of sustainability. This culture of sustainability will also be helped by the reform of the plastics that are deemed essential, so they can be identified easily and recycled properly.
