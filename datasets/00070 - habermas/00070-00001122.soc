# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the United States is not at risk of becoming a dictatorship.  However, there are some elements of US society that trend that way.  The United Nations would likely prevent or even overthrow an dictator from seizing power.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The United States will not become a dictatorship. The US constitution has very clear checks and measures on the power that can go to the president. It also outlines maximum terms and the judicial system is very good at balancing power. The people of the US would never stand idly by if a president tried to take too much power.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the United States is not likely to become a dictatorship because the US constitution has very clear checks and measures on the power that can go to the president.  It also outlines maximum terms and the judicial system is very good at balancing power.  The people of the US would never stand idly by if a president tried to take too much power.  However, in some ways you could say that some presidents have already acted like a dictator and had the same characteristics as one.  A dictatorship could only happen if the government was to fail and someone with popular support or that of the military rose up and assumed that power.  However most americans live a comfortable life at the moment and there is little appetite for revolution, but there is a small chance in future because of a catastrophic event or failing that there could be a situation which would mean a dictatorship is possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The United States of America will never become a dictatorship. This is because America has a strong system of checks and balances. The President of the USA is the head of government, but he is not head of state. He has no official political power, except that which is delegated to him by the constitution. He has limited powers, and these are often checked by other powerful figures, such as the senate. America also has a strong, independent and impartial judiciary. It also has an independent press, which would publicise any attempts by the president to become a dictator. The United States is also a large country with an educated population, who are not afraid to voice their opinions. The American constitution also allows impeachment of the president if he is found to have abused his powers. The United States will also not become a dictatorship because the US is an economic and political superpower, which means it does not need to seize more power.
