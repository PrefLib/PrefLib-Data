# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - By the wording of the question this implies it is for adults, not necessarily children, who wold get education, I think. If it is for other adults, then I think there may be introductory / evening classes in some topics, but I don't think it should cover all education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I believe the government should provide free education to people who have been in the UK for over 5 years as increasing the knowledge of the population is very powerful. This will help the UK increase their standing with the rest of the world and be known as the country that is having high GDP and is very intelectual. Whilst i agree with the free education, I believe it should be limited to UK nationals in the first instance so that the government is focusing on increasing the knowledge of its own population. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes - the more education and knowledge people receieve, the better jobs people will get. This means they will earn more. This in turn means they will spend more. Then the economy will grow. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Absolutely yes. These people are British citizens so why should they not receive free education? They have the right to do so.   People complain about 'immigrants' and have the belief that these people don't work and are sponging off the state (which is untrue). Surely providing free education would reduce unemployment levels?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - The government should provide free education to people who have been in the UK for over 5 years, including private schools and universities. Having a two tier education system is insane, and gives those who can afford to pay a leg up over their peers. This isn't fair and financially restricts say, the next Marie Curie or Alan Turing from fulfilling their potential purely due to the depth of their wallets.
