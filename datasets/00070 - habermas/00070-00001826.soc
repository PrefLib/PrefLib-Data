# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should subsidise electric vehicles to help reduce the use of fossil fuels. The government should give grants to anyone who buys an electric car and should also give a grant for the installation of an electric car charging point at home. The government should make electric cars cheaper for everyone to buy and should increase the number of electric car charging points to make it easier for people to use electric cars on a daily basis. The extra tax from the current car tax system should be ringfenced to pay for the subsidies on electric cars and other green projects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: The government should be subsidising electric vehicles heavily to support the claim that fossil fuels are no longer needed. They should look at buying charging stations for electric cars and allow electric car users to charge for free at petrol stations as well as supermarkets and other large retail stores, including giving a grant to all those wanting to get an electric car charging point installed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Electric cars are very expensive, especially compared to petrol or diesel cars. Moreover, some people who want an electric car cannot get one because they do not have a garage or drive. Some also live in an area which does not have a charging point. If the government really wants people to buy electric cars, it should make them cheaper. This would also help the environment and reduce air pollution in cities. The government should give each household a voucher to buy an electric car which is enough to cover the extra cost over a petrol or diesel car, so each household could decide if they want one or not. A voucher would be better than a subsidy. The government should also give people enough money to get a charging point installed. The government should improve the charging network. There are not enough charging points yet and some people have to wait a long time before they can charge their car. Charging points should be available on more roads and in cities and not just on motorways. The extra car tax raised from the current car tax system should be ringfenced to pay for all these subsidies on electric cars and charging points, to ensure that people are not paying for new schemes through higher taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should heavily subsidise electric vehicles in order to support the idea that fossil fuels are no longer needed. This could be done by giving every household a voucher to pay towards the cost of buying an electric car. The government should also give a grant to all those wanting to get an electric car charging point installed. The cost of electric cars is too high for most people and the range of most electric cars is still too short to make them a practical choice. The government should also do more to make electric cars cheaper for everyone to buy and increase the charging points so it is easier for electric cars to be used on a daily basis. The extra tax from the current car tax system should also be ringfenced to pay for the subsidies on electric cars and other green projects.
