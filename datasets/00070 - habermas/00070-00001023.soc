# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is an onus on the consumer to ensure that food that is purchased is produced in an ethical way. In general, the group was in favour of buying foreign produce, with the caveat that it was produced in an ethical way and that it was safe to consume. The group felt that there was a responsibility to support other countries, and that there was an issue with food miles. The group felt that it was important to buy local where possible, but that it was also important to support other countries. The group felt that it was important to buy foreign produce in order to support the economies of other countries, but that it was important to be careful about the source of the produce and to ensure that it was produced in an ethical way.

The group felt that there was a need to ensure that the food was produced and transported in a safe manner and that the workers were paid fairly and had good working conditions so that there was no exploitation taking place. The exercise can be carried out in person with a number of participants in a room (even just three or four people), or can be done using online tools such as Padlet, or using a spreadsheet such as the one below, where the column on the right records the opinions of individuals and the column on the left records the final consensus statement.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We agree that it is ethical to buy foreign produce. We agree that it is important to support other countries, and that it is important to buy local where possible. However, we agree that there is a responsibility to ensure that foreign produce is produced in an ethical way, and that it is safe to consume. The group also discussed whether buying from abroad is good or bad for the environment, and whether there was a responsibility to buy foreign produce in order to support the economies of other countries. We agree that buying foreign produce helps other countries, but that it is important to be careful about the source of the produce and to ensure that it is produced in an ethical way.
