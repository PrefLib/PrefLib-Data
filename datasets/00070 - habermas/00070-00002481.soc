# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group of participants were in favour of increasing taxes on the rich, however, the definition of rich was a point of contention. The group felt that there should be a more even distribution of wealth in society, and that the rich should contribute more to this. However, the group also felt that the definition of rich is important, as it is difficult to define. It was felt that the rich should be defined as those who are able to afford to pay more tax, and that those who are able to avoid paying tax should be penalised. It was felt that increasing taxes on the rich would lead to a more fair and equal society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “We believe that there should be a higher tax rate for those who are earning a high income. This will help to balance out the income gap between those who are earning a high income and those who are not. It is important to note that this is not a blanket statement and there are nuances to this. For example, the income level at which the higher tax rate would kick in would need to be considered. There are also other factors to consider, such as how this would affect the economy as a whole and whether it would deter people from working hard and earning a high income. We believe that the higher tax rate would need to be implemented in a way that would not discourage people from working hard to earn a high income. We also believe that it is important to consider how this would affect the economy as a whole and whether it would deter people from working hard and earning a high income. It would need to be implemented in a way that would not discourage people from working hard to earn a high income.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing taxes on the rich, however, the definition of rich was a point of contention. The group felt that there should be a more even distribution of wealth in society, and that the rich should contribute more to this. However, the group also felt that the definition of rich is important, as it is difficult to define. It was felt that the rich should be defined as those who are able to afford to pay more tax, and that those who are able to avoid paying tax should be penalised. However, it was felt that the definition of rich should be expanded to include those who are just above the threshold for paying tax, as they are also able to avoid paying tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should increase taxes for rich people. The tax system is too skewed in favour of the rich. If the rich paid more tax then it would help to reduce inequality in society and provide better services for people. We need to redefine what we mean by rich people. We believe that a rich person is anyone earning over 100,000 euro a year. The richest people in the country are the ones benefitting most from the current economy, and they should be required to support poorer communities that provide services they rely on. Rich people are able to use a lot of tax benefits where poorer people are not, and this is unfair in current society. That money should be going to other areas of the community. We also believe that the tax system is too complicated and there are too many ways to avoid tax. If we want to increase taxes for rich people, then we also need to simplify the system. People shouldn’t be able to avoid tax by moving their money to offshore accounts. It is also important that the government invests in education and infrastructure so that people can move up the social ladder if they want to.
