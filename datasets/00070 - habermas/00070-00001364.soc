# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the advantages of term limits outweigh the disadvantages. We believe that term limits can help to prevent corruption and reduce the risk of a cult of personality developing around a politician. We also believe that term limits can help to introduce new blood and new ideas into politics, which is important for a healthy democracy. However, we also believe that term limits can prevent a good politician from doing their job, which is a negative. We believe that term limits should be imposed on the most senior positions, such as the presidency or the prime ministership. Conclusion There were a number of benefits to this exercise. Firstly, the group was able to come to a consensus opinion on a difficult question. This consensus opinion was arrived at through debate, which is an important part of the democratic process. By listening to the views of others and considering the implications of each view, we were able to hone our opinions and come to a common conclusion. This common conclusion took into account all of the relevant issues, including those raised by the people who disagreed with the initial draft consensus statement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We generally agree with the idea of term limits. In general, the advantages of term limits outweigh the disadvantages. We believe that term limits can help to prevent corruption and reduce the risk of a cult of personality developing around a politician. We also believe that term limits can help to introduce new blood and new ideas into politics, which is important for a healthy democracy. However, we also believe that term limits can prevent a good politician from doing their job, which is a negative. We believe that term limits should be imposed on the most senior positions, such as the presidency or the prime ministership. We also believe that term limits can be useful outside of government, for example in NGO leadership positions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the advantages of term limits outweigh the disadvantages. We believe that term limits can help to prevent corruption and reduce the risk of a cult of personality developing around a politician. We also believe that term limits can help to introduce new blood and new ideas into politics, which is important for a healthy democracy. However, we also believe that term limits can prevent a good politician from doing their job, and can incentivise rigging elections to keep incumbents in power, which are negatives. We believe that term limits should be imposed across the board and outside of government, and should be considered alongside other initiatives to reduce corruption such as transparency. We believe that some politicians (but certainly not all) are able to do their job even for longer than their term. Some leaders, even though long-serving, have made a positive contribution and have built positive relationships that can be leveraged to achieve good outcomes. Therefore, our overall view is that term limits are an important aspect of governance, but that they should not be abused or used to stifle positive contributions made by long-serving leaders.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, we believe that the advantages of term limits outweigh the disadvantages. We believe that term limits can help to prevent corruption and reduce the risk of a cult of personality developing around a politician. We also believe that term limits can help to introduce new blood and new ideas into politics, which is important for a healthy democracy. However, we also believe that term limits can prevent a good politician from doing their job, which is a negative. We believe that term limits should be imposed on the most senior positions, such as the presidency or the prime ministership.
