# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK has some of the strictest gun ownership laws in the world, but we should not rest on our laurels. Gun crime in the UK is on the rise and we should be trying to tackle this with harsher sentences and education to those people involved in the crimes. The UK has more that it can do to ensure that ghost guns and other illegal weapons are found and destroyed. The UK also needs to talk more about this issue as it is not only guns that are the problem, there is a lot of knife crimes happening and often it is involving children, for me that shows that we need to make a better job educating children regarding safety and peace.
