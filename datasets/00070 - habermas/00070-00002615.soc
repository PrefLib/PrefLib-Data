# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I understand the premise of this but I feel that abolishing private property will not stop wealth creation is many cases.  Owning private property is a right that everyone should hold and that more help and support should be provided to ensure everyone is able to attain home ownership.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I believe that people should be entitled to their own property especially when they work hard for it. I believe it gives them a piece of mind and security. It  can also make their self esteem higher. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - owning private property is up to the individual abolishing this would be like living in a communist state the government do not have the right to tell people that they cant own property 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - At present, the income gap is incredibly wide. I believe that at least some, but not all, of accumulated wealth should go back into the community. If not, it seems we would have people with a lot more money than they know what to do with, and people who are struggling everywhere. That said, if a parent wants to leave their child a nice fortune, I think this should be allowed - they've also worked hard to accumulate that wealth and should be able to accomplish what they want to do with it. So I would say ... maybe beyond a certain amount that is clearly a comfortable sum to set an individual for life (e.g. 10 million), per child the wealthy person has, the rest of the inheritance could go back to the community. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - There should always be a right to own property.  Intergenerational wealth is an important part of keeping the "cycle" going.  I own property and I absolutely want my daughter to inherit it and be better off financially herself.
