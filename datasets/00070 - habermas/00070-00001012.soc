# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use. This is because the current laws are ineffective and allow the sale of cannabis to continue on the black market, which is more dangerous. By legalising cannabis, it would be possible to control the strength of the product and to ensure that it is sold in a safe environment. The legalisation of cannabis would also reduce the amount of crime associated with cannabis and would reduce the strain on the police force.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK should allow the commercial sale of cannabis. The current law is unworkable and dangerous. It is a gateway to more serious drugs. Cannabis is a naturally occurring substance, which has medicinal properties. It is already widely available on the black market, which is dangerous and expensive. The UK should legalise it and tax it. This would stop it being a gateway to more serious drugs, as the black market would be reduced. It would also stop it being mixed with dangerous substances. It would also allow the government to regulate the strength of cannabis, and to ensure it is not sold to minors. The current law is not working, and is dangerous. It should be changed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of the legalisation of cannabis. The main arguments for this were that it would reduce crime, increase tax revenues and allow for a more regulated market. There was a strong argument for the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal purposes. It was noted that cannabis is already legal in many countries and that the UK is lagging behind. It was noted that there is a high demand for cannabis and that it would be better to legalise it and control it rather than allow it to be sold on the black market.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a legalised and regulated cannabis market in the UK. This would allow for the sale of cannabis in a safe and regulated manner, thus preventing the harms caused by the criminal market. This would also mean that cannabis would be taxed, which would provide a source of income for the government. This would also mean that cannabis would be sold in a safe and regulated manner, and would therefore prevent the harms caused by the criminal market.
