# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Employers should be able to insist that employees have certain hairstyles, however, they should only do so if it is necessary for health and safety reasons. This would include the use of hair nets or hair bands. If an employee feels that they are being treated unfairly, they should raise this with their employer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, an employer should not be able to insist that employees have certain hairstyles. It should be a basic human right for individuals to be able to display their culture or individuality through adopting an hairstyle they wish. The only exception we can envision is if that hairstyle creates some kind of health and safety risk of some kind that cannot be mitigated by protective equipment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the employer should not be able to insist that employees have certain hairstyles. This is a basic human right. The only exceptions could be if the hairstyle creates some kind of health and safety risk that cannot be mitigated by protective equipment or if the hairstyle is inappropriate for the job.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, employers should not be able to insist that employees have certain hairstyles. The UK is a free country and styling yourself as you see fit is a matter of expressing your own right to freedom. It should be noted however that an employer may request you to dress your hair appropriately. Another exception could be the Armed forces which require only particular hairstyles as it can influence your performance on the job.
