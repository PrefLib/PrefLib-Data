# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think there is a reasonable argument for legalising all drugs. This is mainly because the illicit nature of illegal substances means that people cannot always be certain of where they have come from, how pure/ genuine they might be and or how safe they might be to use. If all drugs were made legal, it would be possible to regulate them to the extent that users could access them in safer ways that are less likely to damage their health. I think it's naïve to assume that making drugs illegal prevents users from seeking to access them. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I don't believe that all drugs should be legalized.  Drugs such as Heroin & cocaine have a more detrimental impact if taken - therefore it's important in my opinion that they are regulated & not easily available.  There are drugs such as cannabis that I believe could benefit from legalization - especially for those that benefit from it for medical conditions & not leisure.  Drugs such as Heroin & cocaine are highly addictive.  That said regulation of them to mean less black market sales could have some benefit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes I believe we should. By legalising it we can tax it and control distribution and production standards. Taxes can be used for treatment programs and awareness campaigns against the use of drugs and the risks involved. They could also be used to boost healthcare budgets in general. It would help reduce the amount of crime associated with drug use, buying and selling. This has been shown to be a successful policy in Portugal with usage numbers staying the same or going down rather than up.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No we should not we have enough problems with drugs with out it being made easier for people to get them  I think we would only be creating more problems 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: i don't think we should legalize all drugs as this wouldn't help to discourage people from using them. I agree that through legalization we can reduce crime, regulate usage more, increase tax from sales to support healthcare for users however hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine serve no benefit to the human body they are highly addictive and destroy peoples lives. legalizing such destructive drugs would send the wrong message to our community about the serious physical, mental and social health consequences of these drugs.
