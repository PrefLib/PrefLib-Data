# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of installing solar panels on all houses. It was agreed that solar panels are a great way of reducing our energy costs and they are a great way to help the environment. However, it was also agreed that there are some problems with this idea. It was agreed that it is very expensive to install solar panels on houses and it is not viable for many people to afford to do so. The group thought that the government should help with the cost of installing solar panels but it should not be forced upon people. It was agreed that this is a great idea and it would be a very good thing for the environment but the cost is a big issue and it should be addressed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should encourage people to install solar panels on their houses but not make it mandatory. This is because of the cost of installing the solar panels and also because not all houses are suitable for solar panels.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of solar panels on houses, but not in favour of it being a legal requirement. The group thought that solar panels should be encouraged by the government, with funding being provided for poorer households who may struggle to afford them. The group also thought that all new builds should have solar panels installed as standard.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of solar panels but thought that the current subsidies were insufficient to help the poorest people in society and that the subsidies were also insufficient to incentivise people to take up the option. It was felt that a mandatory approach would be the best way to go, although the group thought that the mandatory approach should only be applied to new builds, rather than existing properties.
