# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although the age of 18 is deemed the legal age for consuming alcohol, it is not necessarily the most appropriate age. Some people may argue that alcohol should be banned altogether but this would be an unrealistic approach. The age of 21 would be more appropriate for the consumption of alcohol as this is the age when people are deemed to be mature enough to vote in elections and are also seen as adults. It is important to note that the legal age of 18 has been in place for a very long time and it would be very difficult to change it now.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Alcohol is very damaging and addicting.  It should not be used by people of younger ages especially when their body and brain is still developing. The current legal age of 18 does still seem too young as someone could still very well be in college and university and getting their life together.  However, alcohol can be relaxing drink if consumed properly so it is really up to the individual in my opinion but increasing the age should help.  There are also more liver issues with the younger generation nowadays.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that we are not in favour of increasing the legal age for consuming alcohol to 21. The age of 18 is the legal age for a person to be an adult, so we feel that they should be allowed to consume alcohol at this age. The age of 18 is also the legal age for a person to vote, so we feel that they should be allowed to consume alcohol at this age. If the age was raised to 21, this would lead to an underground drinking culture, which could fuel crime and lead to a substantially increased workload for the Police. The group of participants came to the consensus view by each person putting forward their opinion, then listening to everyone else's opinions and debating with them. Each person had to give reasons for their opinions and everyone was open to changing their mind if they were convinced by another person's opinion. In the end, the group of participants had to come to an agreement on what their consensus view was going to be.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the legal age for consuming alcohol should be raised to 21. We believe that this is because the majority of people who consume alcohol are in their late teens and early twenties. We also believe that this is the age that people are the most vulnerable and at risk of being affected by alcohol and that the current age of 18 is too young. Alcohol can lead to health issues, liver damage, mental health issues, obesity, increased risk of cancer, increased risk of suicide and death. We believe that alcohol is not good for the body and the brain and that the age of 18 is too young to consume it. We believe that raising the age to 21 will lead to less people consuming alcohol and being affected by it.
