# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should not make it illegal for a person to leave their partner or spouse. People have the right to choose to stay in a relationship or not. There are various reasons why a person may want to leave a relationship and some of these reasons are very serious. If it was made illegal to leave a partner or spouse, a lot of people will suffer unnecessarily.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, it should never be made illegal for a person to leave their partner or spouse.  We are living in a society that is becoming more and more diverse in terms of the nature of relationships people have. To force someone to remain in a relationship is to force them to stay in a relationship that they may no longer feel a part of. It could be an abusive relationship, one that is no longer mutually beneficial, or one that simply doesn't suit the person anymore. We must ensure that everyone is protected, and the best way to do that is to make it impossible for someone to be forced to stay in a relationship.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People have the right to be with the partner of their choice. This is the very basis of what makes a relationship, romantic or otherwise, and so people also have the right to end a relationship. We must also consider the issue of domestic violence. Leaving an abusive partner is necessary to a person's safety. Therefore we must not make it illegal for people to leave their partner or spouse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the idea of forcing people to stay in relationships is repugnant. Most people should have the right to leave their partner or spouse. The idea of forcing people to stay together is too fraught with the potential for abuse and danger. There is a minority of people who should be forced to stay in a relationship, but this should be for a limited period, and with close monitoring of the situation.
