# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We feel that the safety of the public is paramount and any issues with food being imported from places that do animal testing is outweighed by the danger of not being able to import food. The opinion of one person about the rights of animals and the consensus statement about safety are clearly different. The issue is not so much the content of the individual opinions but rather how a group of people come to a consensus that is actually not supported by many individuals in the group.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should ban the import of food from countries that allow animal testing. It's a terrible thing to do to the animals and is avoidable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although it is important to be able to thrive as a nation and keep food prices low, we think that importing food from countries that allow animal testing is wrong. It violates animal rights and there are plenty of other ways to test on food without it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, we believe that food should be imported from countries that allow animal testing because if we didn't, this would cause a rise in the price of food and it would lead to higher levels of poverty. Furthermore, we would also be interfering in the politics of other countries.
