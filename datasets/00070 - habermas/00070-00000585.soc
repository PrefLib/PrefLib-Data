# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a very low chance that there will ever be a cure for the common cold. Scientists will always try to find cures for all diseases but because of the fact that the common cold is not a very serious illness it will likely not be a priority for scientists and thus a cure for the common cold will probably never be found.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The common cold is not a dangerous disease and therefore money spent on research into it would be better spent on other diseases. However, if researchers were to be given the time and resources, there is a possibility that a cure for the common cold would be found.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There are more harmful diseases than the common cold and we should not be focusing our research money on developing a cure for the common cold. However, it is possible that one day we will develop a cure for the common cold.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Money would be better spent on developing cures for more serious diseases. However, with enough resources, it is likely that one day there will be a cure for the common cold.
