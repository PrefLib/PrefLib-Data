# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Four day working week would be a great idea if it was implemented on a voluntary basis. It would not be suitable for all employees and companies and some sectors would struggle. However if it works well for some it would be a step in the right direction.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: A four-day working week should be adopted by the UK. This would benefit employees, who would have more free time and a better work-life balance. Moreover, the UK's productivity would be boosted as people will be less stressed and will be more engaged in their jobs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the idea of the 4 day week in the UK is positive. We should consider adopting this, however there are some cons. For example, if a business is only open Monday-Friday and closed on weekends, the shorter working week would require higher productivity in 4 days rather than 5. This may not be feasible. It may also cause problems for parents as a shorter working week could cause issues in the availability of childcare for the extra day. For example, it could lead to people paying more for childcare. There are some jobs that are not suitable for the 4 day week. For example, police officers or other emergency service personnel are not able to have the same hours as normal workers. The shorter working week would be suitable for the hospitality industry, as they can be flexible and cater for all customers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should adopt a four-day working week. A four-day working week is a measure that will help reduce the stress levels of workers and increase the overall productivity levels. However, this should only be implemented on jobs that don’t require very high demand for their services or product on a daily basis.
