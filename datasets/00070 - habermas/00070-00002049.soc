# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People should not have to buy their own healthcare. The NHS is a vital part of society and people should be allowed to access healthcare free at the point of use. It is a right, not a privilege. The current NHS is badly run, and underfunded, and I hope that in the future the NHS will be looked at more closely and reformed. Healthcare is a right, and it should be free at the point of use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, people should not have to buy their own healthcare insurance.  We have the NHS and it works well.  However, there should be an option for private healthcare if people want to pay for it.  The NHS should be adequately funded by the government, and the government should ensure that there are enough doctors and nurses to provide the care that people need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While it is an important principle that people should have access to healthcare regardless of ability to pay, we do not feel that it should be mandatory.  Healthcare is a personal choice and individuals should have the right to choose whether to purchase it or not.  It is also worth noting that the cost of healthcare is extremely expensive and therefore even if it were mandatory, many individuals may not be able to afford it.  It is however, very important that individuals are made aware of the financial cost of healthcare services and we feel that this is not well communicated by the NHS at present.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, people should not be required to buy their own healthcare insurance.  The NHS is a good system, and the government should be funding it more than they currently do.  The USA system makes affordable healthcare a mere dream for a lot of people, which cannot be ok.  All people are worthy of care and all people are worthy of healthcare.  No matter their background, no matter what decisions they have made in the past, everyone is equally worthy of treatment.  Who is anyone to say that just because someone can afford healthcare, they are more worthy of life and health than someone who cannot.  We pay enough in tax and national insurance already.  We have the NHS.  The NHS is a good system, and the government should be funding it more than they currently do.  The USA system makes affordable healthcare a mere dream for a lot of people, which cannot be ok.  All people are worthy of care and all people are worthy of healthcare.  No matter their background, no matter what decisions they have made in the past, everyone is equally worthy of treatment.  Who is anyone to say that just because someone can afford healthcare, they are more worthy of life and health than someone who cannot.  We pay
