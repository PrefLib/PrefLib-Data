# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I think that the rich should be generous, but in a voluntary way. The issue with the poor being reliant on the rich is that the rich are more likely to offer assistance to projects they believe in, rather than just to the poor in general.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the rich in the UK do have an obligation to help the poor in the UK. There are various reasons why we came to this decision.  We feel that by making a certain amount of money, it’s almost as if you are in a position of privilege and responsibility, so therefore you should help those who are in need. You may have had your parents help you in the past, whether that be financially or otherwise, so by having your own success, you should also help others. If everyone who is in a good position helps, then those who are in need will be helped too. If everyone is helping, then everyone will be able to contribute to making a better country.  By giving a little to help those who are in need, we will all benefit from a better society and country. It is not fair that some people have to live their lives in poverty, when others can live in luxury. People who are in poverty need help and if they receive that help, then they will be able to improve their life for the better. If we all work together to help others who are less fortunate than us, then everyone will be able to have a better standard of living.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We feel that there is an obligation on the rich to help the poor in the UK as long as it is a voluntary contribution. We feel that if the rich were obligated to help the poor it would cause the rich to not want to help the poor in the first place. The UK has a welfare system and people who can not work do receive a certain amount of money to live on so the rich are not necessarily obligated to help. The rich should also help with causes like education, hospitals, and the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We don't believe that the rich have an obligation to help the poor.
