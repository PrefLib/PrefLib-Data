# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that prisons can be better utilised and that the number of people in prison can be reduced in the UK. While in some cases, incarceration is necessary, it should not be the only option available to society in the majority of cases. There are many factors that contribute to crime and many of these factors, such as mental health, poverty, and abuse, are not addressed adequately within prisons.

The prison system should be used for the most dangerous and violent offenders, whilst less dangerous offenders should be given a chance to change their ways. The prison system should focus less on punishment and more on rehabilitation.

A non-interfering supervisor was available to provide any support needed to the participants and ensured that they were able to work autonomously. The pre-debate survey also assessed whether the participants would be willing to change their views or be convinced by the others. In this example, all participants indicated a willingness to change their views if the other participants made good arguments. The pre-debate survey also assessed what arguments the participants were expecting to hear and what they thought would be the most convincing arguments. This is very important for improving the debate session and for ensuring that everyone feels they have been heard and have had an equal chance to share their
