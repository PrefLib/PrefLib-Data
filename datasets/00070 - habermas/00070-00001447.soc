# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The minimum wage should be higher than the Living Wage. It is a disgrace that people are struggling to make ends meet, despite working full time. The government should raise the minimum wage in line with inflation. They should stop wasting money and invest in the people of the country immediately.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The minimum wage should be higher than the Living Wage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The minimum wage should be higher than the living wage. The living wage is not a realistic amount for anyone to live on. The minimum wage is far too low and does not reflect the true cost of living. The minimum wage needs to be increased as it does not reflect the true cost of living especially as inflation is so high. With prices so high, the cost of living has dramatically increased. The minimum wage also needs to be reviewed on a quarterly basis as inflation is rapidly reducing the effectiveness of the minimum wage. This can be reviewed when inflation is under control. The raising of the mininium wage will also increase employment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe the minimum wage should be raised above the living wage. The living wage is too low for people to live on and provides a bare minimum standard of living. The cost of living has increased dramatically in recent months, with the majority of people working, and earning the minimum wage, struggling to get by. The minimum wage does not keep pace with inflation. The minimum wage needs to be reviewed more often to take account of rising inflation. If the minimum wage was to be raised, then employment levels may increase as people will be able to afford to spend more, increasing demand, and businesses will therefore be encouraged to hire more people.
