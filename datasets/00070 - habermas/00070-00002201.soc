# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of making private medical insurance compulsory. This was because the group felt that it was important for everyone to have access to free healthcare and that making private medical insurance compulsory would create a two-tier system. However, the group did feel that it would be appropriate to make private medical insurance compulsory for people who choose to participate in dangerous activities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of making private medical insurance compulsory. The reasons for this included the fact that the NHS is a publicly funded service which should be available to all and that private medical insurance would create a two-tier system where the rich would receive better treatment than the poor. The group was also concerned that making private medical insurance compulsory would lead to the NHS being further underfunded and would lead to a decline in the quality of care.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group believes that it should not be compulsory for people to have private medical insurance. This is because the NHS should be able to provide the necessary services required and if it is failing to do so it should be reformed or receive more funding. Compulsory private medical insurance would unfairly disadvantage the poor who may not be able to afford it. It could lead to poorer quality healthcare for people who cannot afford insurance and, if the NHS does not receive the necessary funding to function properly, then this would only worsen.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should have a choice about whether or not to have private medical insurance. Some people will be able to afford the insurance and others will not. If people choose not to have private medical insurance they should still be able to get medical care but will have to wait in a queue to receive it. The health service will not be able to meet the needs of all patients all of the time. This means that a two-tier health service will be created, and those who can afford to will get faster, better treatment.
