# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Countries should develop more solar and wind energy, but in a way that minimises the environmental impact and protects wildlife.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Countries should develop more solar and wind energy as they are renewable resources. The issue of the land area required to produce the same amount of energy as a traditional power station is a concern, but this is a problem that should be overcome. The safety of birds and wildlife is also an important consideration and must be addressed when siting wind turbines. Conclusion: Solar and wind energy have many advantages over fossil fuels, such as being renewable and safe for the environment, but there are some disadvantages, such as requiring a large land area and not producing enough energy for a country, and these must be overcome in order for these forms of energy to be the future of energy production.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Countries should develop more solar and wind energy as they are renewable resources. The issue of the land area required to produce the same amount of energy as a traditional power station is a concern, but this is a problem that should be overcome.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Countries should develop more solar and wind energy as they are renewable resources. The issue of the land area required to produce the same amount of energy as a traditional power station is a concern, but this is a problem that should be overcome. The issue of pollution is less of a problem than with traditional forms of energy, but care should be taken to ensure wildlife is not harmed and bird deaths due to wind turbines are kept to a minimum.
