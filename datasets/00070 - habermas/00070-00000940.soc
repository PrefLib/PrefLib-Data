# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that there should be rules and regulations that restrict the amount of plastic packaging that supermarkets use for food products. We believe that plastic packaging is often unnecessary and is not disposed of correctly. There are other more earth-friendly options for supermarkets to use. We believe that the government should incentivise companies to make sure their packaging uses plastic less frequently. We believe that supermarkets should lead the way with their corporate responsibility and responsibility to their customers. We believe that they should be encouraged to use alternatives to plastic which will most likely be more expensive at first but will become the new normal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that there should be rules and regulations that restrict the amount of plastic packaging that supermarkets use for food products. Plastic packaging is often unnecessary and is not disposed of correctly. There are other more earth-friendly options for supermarkets to use. We believe that the government should incentivise companies to make sure their packaging uses plastic less frequently. Supermarkets should lead the way with their corporate responsibility and responsibility to their customers. The government should also incentivise R&D so that there is an alternative to plastic packaging that still preserves the food for a similar length of time and so that it doesn't contribute to food wasteage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that there should be rules and regulations that restrict the amount of plastic packaging that supermarkets use for food products. Plastic packaging is often unnecessary and is not disposed of correctly. There are other more earth-friendly options for supermarkets to use. The government should incentivise companies to make sure their packaging uses plastic less frequently. Supermarkets should lead the way with their corporate responsibility and responsibility to their customers. We believe that regulations should be put in place to reduce the usage of plastic. Supermarkets are often lagging behind using new packaging if they are hitting their profits.  We believe that the replacement for plastic should have the same preservation properties so we don't create a new problem in food wasteage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that there should be rules and regulations that restrict the amount of plastic packaging that supermarkets use for food products. We believe that plastic packaging is often unnecessary and is not disposed of correctly. There are other more earth-friendly options for supermarkets to use. We believe that the government should incentivise companies to make sure their packaging uses plastic less frequently.

We believe that the replacement for plastic should have the same preservation properties so we don't create a new problem in food wasteage. Regulations should be put in place to reduce the usage of plastic. Supermarkets are often lagging behind using new packaging if they are hitting their profits. I would add reasons why plastic packaging should not be used for example it ends up in the ocean and endangers the lives of animals such as turtles as they get caught up in the packaging.
