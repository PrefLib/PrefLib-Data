# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of improving public transport in urban areas. This is because it would reduce congestion, reduce pollution and provide a more reliable way to travel. However, the group also recognised that this would be expensive, and that the government may have other priorities for their spending. The group also recognised that the current public transport system is very good in some areas, but not in others. The group felt that the government should focus their efforts on improving public transport in the areas where it is currently the worst.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK should put more effort into improving public transport in urban areas. There are several reasons for this, including: 1) It will encourage less cars on the road, which will help to reduce carbon emissions. 2) It will reduce traffic, and therefore reduce congestion in urban areas. 3) It will make it easier for people to travel to areas where they are less likely to own a car, for example people on lower incomes, or young people who may not be able to afford to run a car. 4) There is also evidence to show that people with access to good public transport are more likely to use public transport, and not own a car. 5) It will make life easier for those who cannot drive, or cannot afford a car. The group is aware that this will not come without cost, and that there are other important things that this funding could be spent on, but feel that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Public transport in urban areas should be improved. It should be improved because it is becoming increasingly expensive and unreliable, which makes it unappealing to use. If we can improve public transport, it would help to reduce emissions, which would benefit the economy and the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the UK should put more effort into improving public transport in urban areas. This is because it will make it easier for people to get around, and reduce the amount of cars on the road. It will also make it easier for people to get to work and school, and reduce the amount of people being late. However, it is important to note that improving public transport will come at a cost, and it is important to ensure that the money spent on improving public transport is spent in the most effective way possible. It is also important to note that improving public transport will not solve all of the problems with transport in the UK, and that we should also be looking at other ways to reduce the amount of cars on the road, such as improving cycle lanes, and increasing the price of fuel.
