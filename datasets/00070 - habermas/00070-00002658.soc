# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should raise the minimum wage in the UK. We need to do whatever is possible to make the lives of everyone easier. There are too many people reliant on food banks, this in itself shows what a significant problem this is. People on highest wages need to be taxed more to provide the necessary means for everyone to be able to live comfortably. There needs to be a correlation between higher wages against rising costs of produce, goods, transports and services. We should strive to become a high productivity, highly skilled economy and for that to happen the market force mechanism of a higher minimum wage will have to be applied. Those who work should not be struggling for the basic necessities of life. We need to ensure that we stamp down on in-work poverty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of raising the minimum wage in the UK. We all agreed that the cost of living crisis is a major issue and that the minimum wage should be raised to combat this. However, we were aware that the minimum wage is a very sensitive issue, and that it should be raised in a way that does not cause too much inflation or harm businesses. We felt that the government should provide some subsidies to businesses to help them cope with the extra costs of paying higher wages. We also felt that the government should provide subsidies to low income families to help them cope with the cost of living crisis.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “We believe that the minimum wage should be raised to combat the cost of living crisis. We also believe that the government should help subsidise the costs of the increase in wages, as it would be unfair for businesses to have to absorb the costs of the wage increase. The raise in minimum wage should be a manageable amount for businesses to handle and not cause them to have to let staff go. We also believe that there should be a correlation between higher wages against rising costs of produce, goods, transports and services. This would ensure that the cost of living crisis does not worsen. We believe that the minimum wage should be raised to combat the cost of living crisis, although the extra costs should be slightly subsidised by the government to prevent businesses from raising prices and causing too much inflation.
