# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of doctors being able to prescribe life-ending drugs to patients with terminal illnesses, provided there were very robust guidelines in place and always included the expert opinion of at least two medical practitioners and the consent of the patient or their family if the patient cannot give their consent. This is because the group believe that the decision to end a life is a very serious one and it is important that it is made by a number of experts and with the consent of the patient or their family.
