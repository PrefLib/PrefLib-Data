# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, there should be a limit to the amount of fish people can catch for recreation. It is important to maintain a healthy fish population and to limit the impact of recreational fishing on local rivers and ponds. However, the limit should not be too strict and should be set at a level that is appropriate for the local environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that there should be a limit to the amount of fish people can catch for recreation. The amount of fish in the world's waterways is dwindling, and if we want to protect the environment for future generations, we must take steps to protect fish. It is also important to consider the health of the fish population in recreational fishing, as fish are an important food source for humans and other animals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In principle, there should be a limit to the amount of fish people can catch for recreation. However, it is important to bear in mind that some recreational fishing is already regulated and some is not. In cases where recreational fishing is already regulated, the current limits are sufficient and should be maintained. In cases where recreational fishing is not currently regulated, we recommend that a limit should be set. The limit should be set at a level which ensures that the recreational fishing is sustainable and does not have a negative impact on the local environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a limit to the amount of fish people can catch for recreation. However, this limit should be set at a level which allows for the continuation of the recreational fishing industry. This would allow for people to still enjoy the hobby of fishing, but also protect the fish stocks from over-fishing. This is particularly important for fish species which are already threatened or endangered.
