# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Students should be encouraged to take a foreign language but it should not be a compulsory part of the curriculum. The current situation should continue.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of students taking a foreign language in school. However, the group was not in favour of forcing students to take a foreign language. The group felt that students should have the option to take a foreign language, but should not be forced to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that students should take a foreign language in school, due to the important cultural, economic and social benefits that this will bring. It will also be of benefit to the UK as a whole, if a significant proportion of the population is able to speak a foreign language. The ability to speak a foreign language would enable individuals to more easily travel abroad, which would be of benefit to the UK tourism industry. In addition, if more people in the UK are able to speak foreign languages, this would enable the UK to forge stronger trade links with other countries, which would be of economic benefit. We feel that in a multicultural society, learning a foreign language would allow individuals to learn about other cultures, thereby promoting racial harmony and tolerance. In addition, learning a foreign language would be a useful life skill, as an individual would then be able to communicate with others more easily.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of students having to take a foreign language in school.  It was felt that this would be of great benefit to them in later life, especially in terms of their ability to travel and work abroad.  It was also felt that learning a foreign language would help students to appreciate other cultures, and prevent them from viewing the world in a narrow-minded way.  However, it was also felt that the choice of foreign language should be left to the student, and that they should not be forced to learn a language that they have no interest in.  It was also felt that the choice of foreign language should be based on its usefulness to the student, and that some languages are more useful than others.
