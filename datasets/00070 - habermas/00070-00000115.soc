# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Humans have a basic moral sense that is inborn. The way we act morally in society is learned from others, especially our parents and peers. Society as a whole also plays a big role in influencing our behaviour through the things we see in the media and in politics. Everyone has a different moral sense, but at the core, most people have a basic idea of right and wrong, which helps us get along with each other and form communities.” In this example, it is clear that the way the group consensus statement was formed was to take each opinion in turn, discuss any criticisms of the opinion, and then develop a consensus view that incorporates the opinions of all of the participants. In a way, the first draft consensus statement was like a working document for the participants to work with, with critiques coming in from all sides.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Humans have an innate ability to be moral. Children are born with an innate sense of morality and as they grow older, they learn from those around them and from the news and TV, so they develop their innate sense. Throughout their lives, people’s sense of morality is shaped by their experiences, culture and the society in which they live.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “I believe that we are all born with an innate sense of morality, because as soon as a child is born they can distinguish right from wrong. This innate sense is developed throughout life by watching those around them, especially their parents. They also learn from society in general, by listening to the news, watching tv and learning from their peers at school. I believe that some people are more morally aware than others, which makes them more likely to engage in good deeds and help those in need.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The innate ability of humans to be moral can be seen in young children who instinctively know that it is wrong to do something such as stealing. This is something that is developed further as they grow up, however, through watching the people around them, such as their parents, and through the influence of society as a whole, for example, watching the news. This is why it is so important for young children to be brought up in an environment where morality is modelled to them by those who care for them." A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft of a consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement by the participants, and the final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
