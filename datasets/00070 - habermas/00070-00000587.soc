# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The world is a shared resource, and it is everyone's responsibility to ensure it is not harmed by their own actions. Everyone needs to be responsible for their own impact on the environment. Everyone needs to make an effort to minimise their negative impact on the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People need to live in a way that does not harm the environment, however we need to help educate people on how their actions affect the environment and how they can make changes to protect the environment. After reading the opinions above, what would your opinion be? a) Are the opinions of the individual participants clear and concise? b) Does the consensus statement capture the essence of the debate? c) Would you have been happy to agree with this consensus statement?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is not ethical to live in a way that deliberately harms the environment. However, it is not always easy to see how regular and irregular activities cause harm. It's also difficult to calculate whether changes in behavior are always beneficial or causing some other harm we are not aware of.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, it is not ethical for a person to live in a way that harms the environment. The fact that many people are still living unethically towards the environment suggests there is a lack of awareness of the importance of the environment and the consequences of people's actions. It is therefore vital to improve awareness. It is also important to encourage and reward those people who do act in a more ethical manner towards the environment.
