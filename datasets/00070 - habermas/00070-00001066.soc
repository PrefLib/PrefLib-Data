# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “No, it is not time to ban all cars from the city centre. However, it is time to improve public transport and make it more accessible to all. The current public transport offering is too expensive and not reliable enough to make it a viable alternative to the car. This needs to be addressed and a more attractive public transport offering needs to be made available to all before any consideration of banning cars from the city centre can be made. This would be unfair on many groups who rely on the car to get to work or complete onward journeys. However, there is a need to make the city centre more pedestrian friendly and encourage people to walk and cycle more. This will help with public health and reduce congestion in the city centre. There is also a need to improve the air quality in the city centre and this can be achieved by encouraging more people to use public transport and cycle. This will also help to reduce congestion in the city centre. There is a need to improve the public transport offering but it is not time to ban all cars from the city centre.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is time to ban all cars from the city centre, but only after the public transport offering has been dramatically improved, to negate many of the reasons why people currently prefer to drive in. Public transport is patchy and underfunded as well as being expensive in many areas, and the alternative transport options available to the disabled and those who have onward and multiple journeys to complete in a day need to be addressed first.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, it is not time to ban all cars from the city centre. This is because there are still people who need to use their cars for commuting and other journeys. The public transport offering needs to be improved dramatically before any consideration is given to banning cars. The disabled and those who have onward and multiple journeys to complete in a day would be impacted by a ban.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “While the pollution, queues and impact of cars in the city centre is acknowledged, a ban on all cars would be too drastic a measure and have far reaching consequences for many residents. Instead there needs to be more of a focus on providing alternative modes of transport to cars, particularly through the development of improved public transport and cycle paths. In addition to this, there needs to be a greater awareness of the negative impact cars are having on the city centre and city as a whole. The current situation where car drivers are not responsible for the pollution and impact of their car on the city is not sustainable. There needs to be greater responsibility put on car drivers to change their ways.”
