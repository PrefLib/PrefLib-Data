# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to have their own Instagram account. Instagram is a social media platform that has become incredibly popular, especially with young people. This has resulted in a lot of children feeling pressured to have their own account, as they feel they are missing out on something. This is not the case, children under the age of 13 should be encouraged to spend their time with their friends and family, enjoying the outdoors, playing sports and having fun. They should not be exposed to the pressures of social media, which can lead to issues with their self-esteem, as they are comparing themselves to others and feeling as if they are not good enough. They should not be exposed to the bullying that is prevalent on social media, and they should not be exposed to content that is not age appropriate.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to have their own Instagram account. As a social media platform, Instagram has gained popularity over recent years. As such it has become very popular with young people. Young people can feel pressured to have their own Instagram account as they feel they are missing out on something if they do not. However this is not the case. There are other ways to share memories with your family and friends, and the whole "likes" culture of Instagram can leave young people feeling as if they are not good enough in comparison to other people. As a social media platform, Instagram is not suitable for children under the age of 13, there is pressure to conform to a standard, content can be inappropriate for young children, and children can be exposed to bullying via Instagram. Children under the age of 13 should be able to be kids for as long as possible. The draft consensus statement was critiqued and subsequently revised and a final consensus statement was reached by the participants, this is then deemed to be the definitive position of the group of participants on the question that was posed at the start of the activity.
