# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of veganism, however, there was some contention as to whether it was better to be a vegan than an omnivore. The participants felt that veganism was a more moral and ethical way to live, however, they also felt that veganism was not necessarily the most nutritionally beneficial way to live. It was felt that there are some vegan products which are heavily processed and may not be as nutritionally beneficial as an omnivorous diet. The group also felt that veganism is not necessarily the most environmentally friendly way to live. It was felt that there are some vegan products which are flown or shipped across the world, which may have a negative impact on the environment. The group felt that there should be freedom of choice in terms of diet, however, there should be a mindful approach to the impact of diet on the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a freedom of choice in terms of diet. However, we must be mindful of the impact of our diet on the environment and other living creatures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is better to be vegan than omnivore because a vegan diet is more healthy, less environmentally harmful, and more morally right.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of an omnivorous diet but we all had different reasons why. A vegan diet can be nutritionally unbalanced due to lack of certain nutrients that only exist in animal products. We were not entirely sure whether a vegan diet is more environmentally sustainable due to a lot of research coming to different conclusions. The meat industry is a huge contributor to global warming, however the debate continues to be controversial due to the fact that veganism also requires energy and resources. I think that although I believe in personal choice, if everyone was to become vegan, I believe that this would be better for the environment and for health.
