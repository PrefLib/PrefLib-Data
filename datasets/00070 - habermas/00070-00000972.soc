# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Social media has had both positive and negative impacts on society. The benefits of social media are that it makes it easier for people to connect with each other. This can be used for pre-existing groups, and for new groups which can only be established through social media. The negative aspects of social media are that it has created an environment where people are more focused on being seen as popular or interesting as opposed to being genuine. Social media creates unwanted pressures on teenagers and children and has also caused a massive rise in "cyber bullying".
