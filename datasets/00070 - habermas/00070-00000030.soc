# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “I think that we should ban single-use plastics in the long term. In the short term however we must educate people about the damage they can do and implement policy that will deter people from using them.“
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should try to ban all single-use plastics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of reducing the use of single-use plastics. However, they agreed that there are cases where plastic use is justified (e.g. packaging food that would otherwise spoil). The group agreed that we should try to find alternatives but should also encourage people to avoid single-use plastics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that a ban on all single-use plastics would be too impractical at this current moment and there should be further research into other solutions that would make single-use plastics less of a problem.
