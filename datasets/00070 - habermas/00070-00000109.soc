# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of limiting the time people can hold public office. Most people felt that this is a good thing because it gives new people a chance to contribute. However, there was one person who felt that the public is better served by people who are experienced and have gained a certain amount of political experience, but all participants agreed that there should be a maximum period of time for each position.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a maximum time that a person can hold public office. It will prevent a political class from forming who only have self-serving interests. It also allows the systems of checks and balances to take place and prevents absolute power corrupting absolutely.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a maximum amount of time that a person can hold public office, in order to prevent a political class from forming and to allow new people to gain access to public office. This prevents the accumulation of power in one person’s hands and allows fresh ideas and new perspectives to be heard. It also allows a check on the possibility of old age and senility coming into play when making decisions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Yes, we believe that there should be a maximum period of time that a person can hold public office. We think that this will be good for democracy because it will allow new blood to enter into office. This will help to foster new ideas and innovations and to prevent corruption in the public sector.
