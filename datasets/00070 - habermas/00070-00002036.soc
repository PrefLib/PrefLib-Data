# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “In conclusion, Britain does have a debt problem. This is a result of a combination of factors, including the current economic crisis and cost of living crisis, a lack of financial awareness taught to children in schools and a culture of consumerism. In the current crisis, debt is unavoidable for a lot of families, it is either rely on credit or not be able to afford to keep the house over your head or feed your children. This is an issue that needs to be addressed and the government needs to provide support to families and individuals to help them avoid getting into debt and help those who are in debt to get out of it.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Britain has a debt problem. Many Britons are using credit to get by and whilst this has been a necessity for many during COVID, the pandemic has highlighted that there are deep inequalities in our society. We believe there is a lack of financial education, particularly in schools, leading people to not be able to control their own finances, resulting in people relying more and more on credit. It is easy to fall into debt due to this, and often once people are in debt it can be very difficult to get out of it. We believe that governments are not doing enough to tackle this and are instead focusing on just bailing out banks rather than supporting the people. The Covid pandemic has exposed the need for a major change in our society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Britain does have a debt problem. The problem is that people are falling into debt more easily than ever. This is due to the cost of living crisis, as well as people being less financially aware. The government are working to get the country out of debt but it is a long process. The current crisis has made the debt problem worse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Britain does have a debt problem. The high cost of living crisis is the main cause for people getting into debt, which has only been exacerbated during the current crisis. Individuals are unable to live within their means and are therefore getting into more and more debt. This is because the cost of living crisis is becoming ever more serious.
