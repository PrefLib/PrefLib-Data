# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Cryptocurrencies are a way of the future. Cryptocurrencies are the future of online transactions. There is a clear need for an alternative to traditional currency. We should not ban cryptocurrencies as this will stifle innovation and the free market. We should embrace cryptocurrencies and ensure that the necessary regulation is in place to protect consumers. We should also ensure that cryptocurrencies are affordable to the average consumer and not just an investment opportunity for the wealthy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, the UK should not ban all the cryptocurrencies. There are many advantages to using cryptocurrency as a means of exchange, not least the anonymity and the security that it provides. It also provides an alternative to the current banking system, which some may prefer. The disadvantages are that cryptocurrencies are volatile and difficult to predict. This means that they are not a reliable form of exchange, which can lead to people losing money. However, people are free to make their own choices and if they wish to use cryptocurrencies then they should be free to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to banning cryptocurrencies. The general view was that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and banning them would not achieve anything. The general view was that the government should regulate cryptocurrencies rather than banning them. There were some differences of opinion, however, on how cryptocurrencies should be regulated. Some members of the group felt that the government should not interfere with cryptocurrencies at all. Other members of the group felt that the government should make cryptocurrencies more transparent. For example, the price of Bitcoin varies significantly from one exchange to another. Some members of the group felt that the government should make the price of Bitcoin consistent across all exchanges. The group also noted that there are some aspects of cryptocurrency that are illegal. The group felt that the government should take action to stop these aspects of cryptocurrency. For example, cryptocurrencies are often used for illegal activities such as money laundering, drug dealing and tax evasion. The group felt that the government should stop these illegal activities from happening.

We should not ban cryptocurrencies as this will stifle innovation and the free market. We should embrace cryptocurrencies and ensure that the necessary regulation is in place to protect consumers. We should also ensure that the price of cryptocurrencies is low enough for the average consumer to be able to use them for online transactions.
