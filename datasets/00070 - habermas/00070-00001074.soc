# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of encouraging the eating of insects to save the planet. The group felt that the eating of insects would be more environmentally friendly than the eating of animals, as the production of insects would require less resources and the insects themselves would be less harmful to the environment. However, the group did not feel that the eating of insects would be a quick fix to save the planet and that it would be more beneficial to encourage vegetarianism and veganism. The group also felt that the eating of insects would not be for everyone, as it is a cultural difference and some people would not be comfortable with the idea of eating insects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although eating insects is a foreign concept to many, it is one that is growing in popularity and awareness around the world. It has been proven to be a beneficial way to save our planet, however we should not encourage the eating of insects but instead encourage the idea of vegetarianism or even, everyone's favourite term, veganism.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of eating insects, however, not all agreed on the idea of eating insects. Some were willing to eat insects whereas some had their doubts about the cleanliness of the bugs. The overall consensus was that we should encourage people to eat insects as it is a more sustainable food source than the consumption of animals. The meat industry requires a lot of energy to produce, however the breeding of insects require less energy and resources. The participants would also need more evidence to be convinced that the bugs that are eaten are not clean or dirty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of encouraging the eating of insects. This was because insects are important to the planet and the idea of eating insects is disgusting to most people. However, some people in the group thought that it could be a good idea if insects were farmed in a way that was not harmful to the environment and if they were made to taste nice.
