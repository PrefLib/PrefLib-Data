# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to encouraging everyone to get a degree. The group felt that degrees are very good for some people to get a start on the careers they want for themselves but a degree is not for everyone. The qualities that you need for a degree are not necessarily needed in all career choices and so they would just be a waste of time and money for certain people. The group felt that people should be allowed to decide for themselves if they want to get a degree. The group felt that encouraging everyone to get a degree would lead to massive holes in vital industries all over the country. The group felt that encouraging everyone to get a degree has been a disaster. The group felt that turning colleges into universities and giving students sub par below average degrees that just saddle them with lifetime of debt an no chance of a meaningful career has been a disaster. The group felt that discouraging people from getting things like trades like Plumbing etc which pay well and are solid careers has been a disaster. The group felt that encouraging everyone to get a degree has led to students who would have been better off doing an internship or apprenticeship being encouraged at a young age to get themselves into significant debt for a degree that will not progress their career in any way
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, we should not encourage everyone to get a degree. We believe that university is not for everyone, and that university is often used as a way to delay entering the working world. We believe that university should be for people who have a specific career in mind that requires a degree, or for people who are passionate about a subject and want to pursue it further. We believe that apprenticeships and internships are a great way for people to get into their chosen career, and that university is not always the best option.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not encourage everyone to get a degree. In the past, university degrees were used to break into professional careers that required a higher level of learning. However, now we have many degrees by average universities that are run as cash cows. Students who would have been better off doing an internship or apprenticeship are encouraged at a young age to get themselves into significant debt for a degree that will not progress their career in any way. In addition, they are unlikely to pay off their student loan if their ultimate potential career is low-paid, meaning the taxpayer has to foot the bill for students going to university for the sake of it. At the same time, we have discouraged people from getting things like trades like plumbing etc which pay well and are solid careers. We should, however, be encouraging people to seek out apprenticeships and internships, which offer a great way to break into well-paid careers and can be an alternative to degrees.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should not encourage everyone to get a degree. In the past, university degrees were used to break into professional careers that required a higher level of learning. However, now we have many degrees by average universities that are run as cash cows. Students who would have been better off doing an internship or apprenticeship are encouraged at a young age to get themselves into significant debt for a degree that will not progress their career in any way. In addition, they are unlikely to pay off their student loan if their ultimate potential career is low-paid, meaning the taxpayer has to foot the bill for students going to university for the sake of it. At the same time, we have discouraged people from getting things like trades like plumbing etc which pay well and are solid careers. We should not want to stop young people going to university if they want to. However, we should make them more aware of the possible outcomes of their decision, and help them consider alternatives that will set them up in a more financially secure position.
