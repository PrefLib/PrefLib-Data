# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to use social media. This is because they do not have the necessary knowledge of how to use it safely or the experience of how to avoid things that may harm them. There are many dangers of social media that can be damaging to a child's mental health and can cause them to become isolated and exposed to bullying. Children under 13 are still developing and are at risk of being exposed to content that may have a negative effect on their mental health and development. Children are easily influenced by what they see online and it is important that they are not exposed to this at such a young age. The dangers of social media are very real and children should not have access to these apps/sites before they are old enough to understand and deal with them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to use social media. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the content that can be viewed on these sites/apps can be harmful and inappropriate for younger viewers. Once children have access, it is very difficult to control what they see. Whilst some children may be mature enough to view the content, the vast majority will not be. It could negatively affect their mental well being and perceptions of the world. Secondly, it is very easy for children to become addicted to social media, which could lead to health problems and social isolation. This is something that is already being seen in teenagers and adults. Finally, children under the age of 13 do not need the added pressure that is associated with social media. They are in a vulnerable stage of their lives and are still developing their own personality and sense of self. Social media can be very harmful to their confidence and well being.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to use social media. Whilst social media can be used in a positive way, the content and interactions that can occur are not suitable for children of this age. Children are not yet mature enough to handle the negative impacts that can occur from social media usage. The content that can be viewed can be harmful and inappropriate for younger viewers. The risk of children being exposed to harmful content and interactions is too great and can have a negative impact on their mental well being and perceptions of the world. The issue of online safety is also a concern and children are not yet clued up on how to stay safe online. Social media is difficult to control with the content children are exposed to and have access to. Children of this age also do not need to be influenced by adults and don't understand certain nuances. Children are in danger of speaking to people they don't know. The group of participants believe that children under 13 should not be allowed to use social media.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to use social media. Whilst social media can be used in a positive way, the content and interactions that can occur are not suitable for children of this age. Children are not yet mature enough to handle the negative impacts that can occur from social media usage. The content that can be viewed can be harmful and inappropriate for younger viewers. The risk of children being exposed to harmful content and interactions is too great and can have a negative impact on their mental well being and perceptions of the world. The issue of online safety is also a concern and children are not yet clued up on how to stay safe online. Social media is difficult to control with the content children are exposed to and have access to. Children of this age also do not need to be influenced by adults and don't understand certain nuances. Children are in danger of speaking to people they don't know. Social media can be a force for good, when used in a social manner but it can equally be used to undermine the vulnerable. The group of participants believe that children under 13 should not be allowed to use social media.
