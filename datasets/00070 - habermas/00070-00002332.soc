# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of encouraging people to eat insects. The main argument was that it is not necessary to eat insects to save the planet, and that there are other more sustainable sources of protein. It was also argued that insects are not a versatile food source and that many people would be put off by having to eat them. It was agreed, however, that insects could be used to feed livestock, and that this could be a more sustainable way of producing meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of eating insects to save the planet. The reasons for this included the fact that insects are not a very versatile food and that there are other more sustainable sources of protein that could be used instead. The group also felt that there would be a large number of people who would be put off by the idea of eating insects and so it would be very difficult to get people to eat them. However, the group did feel that insects could be used to feed livestock and so reduce the amount of meat that we need to produce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of encouraging people to eat insects. This was for a variety of reasons, including the fact that it would be difficult to get people to change their diet and also because it would be difficult to get people to overcome their disgust of eating insects. The group did agree, however, that insects could be used as a protein source for livestock and that this could be a useful way of reducing the environmental impact of livestock farming.
