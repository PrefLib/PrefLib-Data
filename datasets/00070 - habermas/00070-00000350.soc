# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Politicians should not ask for personal favours from their aides.  It's fine for a politician to ask their aide to do something that their aide is responsible for, but asking for a personal favour that they could hire someone to do for them is going too far.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is not OK for a politician to ask an aide for a personal favour. Politicians should employ people for tasks that they can not do themselves. If a politician needs someone to do their shopping for them, they should hire a personal shopper.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, it is not OK for a politician to ask an aide for a personal favour.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: it is not OK for a politician to ask an aide for a personal favour.
