# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not acceptable to smoke on the job. The health and safety of others should be a primary concern of the company. There are ways of creating a separate designated smoking area away from the workplace and if this is not done, then it will result in health problems and additional costs for the company. In addition, time taken up by smoking on the job results in other workers having to cover for that person or have work that requires the whole team be delayed. This means that the smoker will be drawing additional pay for their smoking break when the work is not being done.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, it is not okay to smoke on the job. If you are going to smoke, you should do it during your break.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Smoking on the job is not okay as it is not fair to non smokers. The issue of smoking is a health concern for smokers and non smokers. If a person is a smoker they should try to quit or at least not smoke at work. If they are unable to do this, they should go outside the building to smoke. This will ensure that non smokers are not negatively impacted by the smoke and will allow smokers to take a break from their work. This will also ensure that smokers are not seen to be taking extra breaks and will ensure that they are not negatively impacting the work of others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The practice of smoking on the job is acceptable as long as all parties involved agree to it, and as long as it does not adversely affect the work output of those who do not smoke.
