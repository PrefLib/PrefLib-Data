# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the minimum wage is something that is in place to protect workers from being exploited for little pay. A maximum wage would be rather hard to put into practice as this would have to be on an individual basis as people are not on the same level of productivity and therefore will not make the same amount of money. However, I think it would be good to have a maximum and minimum wage for big company CEOs, such as the CEO of Facebook. This would also help with wage equality, as currently there is a huge gap between the highest and lowest paid in the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should have a maximum and minimum wage. A maximum wage is important to ensure that CEO's do not exploit their employees and pay themselves huge salaries that are unjustified. However, we should also have a minimum wage to ensure that workers are not exploited by businesses for very low pay.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: A minimum wage is essential in the world today, for employers who try to exploit workers, who are prepared to work for any wage in order to get a job. A maximum wage is also essential to ensure that people who work are not underpaid in relation to people who do not work and are simply paid from the state.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that a minimum wage should be set by the government. If there is no minimum wage then the potential to exploit workers and abuse their conditions will be much greater. The rate should be set by the government in such a way that it will increase the income of the lowest paid and protect them from the effects of inflation. The minimum wage should be set at a rate that is below the National Living Wage as this will take into account workers who are currently on low wages and not able to earn the living wage. The group was then asked to look at the following question:
