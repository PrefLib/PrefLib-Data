# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Citizen's Jury
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The citizen's jury agreed that they would like to see a living wage but felt that a set living wage would cause more problems than it would solve. The jury discussed that the living wage is a set amount and is therefore an average. This means that some people would get a lower living wage and others would get a higher living wage. Some members of the jury thought that if people got more than the living wage, then this would be a disincentive to work harder and could result in the whole system of working to be undermined. If people got less than the living wage, this would be seen as unfair. Instead, the jury thought that we should encourage employers to pay higher wages by increasing the minimum wage.
