# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should be taking a much more active role in developing sustainable alternatives to the use of fossil fuels, such as the development of nuclear fusion or alternative energy sources, as this would lead to the reduction in the overall reliance on fossil fuels. While the effects of carbon tax on reducing individual emissions is disputed, it is agreed that this is one of the many tools that governments should be using to encourage businesses to decrease their emissions. Furthermore, while a carbon tax is the best way to persuade businesses to do the right thing, it should be a universal carbon tax, i.e. imposed by the whole world, to ensure that the companies do not move to a country with a low or no carbon tax. The idea of monitoring carbon emission by companies is a good one as it provides the incentive for companies to decrease their carbon emission.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The governments should impose carbon tax but they have to do it carefully. They need to understand what the impacts are, what the negative impacts are, and what the positive impacts are, so they can come to a consensus to create a positive outcome.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that a carbon tax is necessary to reduce the amount of carbon emissions. It is also necessary for the government to closely monitor the carbon emissions of companies. The government should also help companies with their emission reducing measures and give tax relief. The government should also enforce the carbon tax to ensure that the companies do not find ways to cheat the system. The government should also help the citizens by implementing measures to reduce the cost of living, so that the citizens do not feel the impact of the carbon tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes, the government should impose a carbon tax. However, it should be a tax on companies and not individuals. The tax should be used to help companies invest in new technologies and implement emission decreasing measures. The tax should be imposed gradually and be closely monitored.
