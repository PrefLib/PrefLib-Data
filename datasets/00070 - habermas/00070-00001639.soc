# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, there should not be a legal minimum age limit for buying a bicycle. We do not think it is an area that the government should legislate about. Children are routinely bought a bicycle by their parents and carers at the correct time. Bicycles are a fast, reliable and cheap alternative to cars or public transport and it would be a shame to deprive younger people of that benefit. Riding a bicycle is also generally good for your health and as a mode of transport will most likely become more prevalent as the world goes greener. We would also like to see the government work with bicycle clubs to help equip more people with the skills to look after, maintain and fit accessories to a bike such as front and rear lights as they are important for safety.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should not be a legal minimum age limit for buying a bicycle. The government should not legislate in this area. Children are routinely bought a bicycle by their parents and carers at the correct time. Bicycles are a fast, reliable and cheap alternative to cars or public transport and it would be a shame to deprive younger people of that benefit. Riding a bicycle is also generally good for your health and as a mode of transport will most likely become more prevalent as the world goes greener. The government should work with bicycle clubs to help equip more people with the skills to look after, maintain and fit accessories to a bike such as front and rear lights as they are important for safety. Conclusion: Throughout the three rounds, it is clear to see that each participant voiced their own opinion on the topic, which led to the creation of the first draft of the consensus statement. From here, the critiques were able to be discussed, leading to the creation of the final consensus statement. It is also clear to see that each participant, in all three rounds, contributed and voiced their opinions and views.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, there should not be a legal minimum age limit for buying a bicycle. We do not think it is an area that the government should legislate about. Bicycles are a fast, reliable and cheap alternative to cars or public transport and it would be a shame to deprive younger people of that benefit. Riding a bicycle is also generally good for your health and as a mode of transport will most likely become more prevalent as the world goes greener. We suggest that rather than having a legal age limit, government should be working with youth clubs and cycling clubs to help people develop the skills for looking after, maintaining, riding and fitting accessories to a bike such as front and rear lights as they are important for safety.
