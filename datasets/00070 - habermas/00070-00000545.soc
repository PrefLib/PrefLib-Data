# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should ban new-build coal power stations. However, this should be carefully considered on a country by country basis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of moving away from coal power and towards cleaner energy sources such as wind and solar. The group felt that due to the large existing coal capacity in some countries and the long lives of coal plants, and the fact that they are currently a major contributor to global electricity generation, it would not be practical to ban new coal power stations. A few of the participants were concerned about the cost implications of renewables. The participants agreed that it was a challenge, but that there were many developing technologies in this field which could address this in the future. There was also some concern raised that it might be possible to build new coal plants which emit less CO2 than existing coal plants, but these were not widespread. The group felt that the key way forward was to develop cleaner energy sources and put greater emphasis on conservation and energy efficiency.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No - coal power stations should not be banned, but we must focus on finding more efficient, sustainable and renewable ways of energy production in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe the most sustainable option would be to work towards a zero-carbon future, in which new-build coal power stations should be banned and non-renewable energy sources should be replaced by renewable sources. The group were given a tool to help them reach their consensus and the above statement was the outcome of their decision making.
