# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a cut in the number of students accepted to UK universities to maintain standards of education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although education is important, it should be seen as a privilege and not a right. There are too many universities in the UK and this is an area that needs reform. The quality of education needs to improve to ensure that we can compete on a global scale. The number of students going to university should be reduced and the number of universities should also be reduced. This will help to improve the quality of education. However, this will also result in a reduction in the number of students able to go to university, which may negatively impact on our overall economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we do not think the number of students accepted to UK universities should be cut. While it is true that universities are inundated with students and there is a limit to the number of people they can accept, there are a lot of ways of addressing this problem. One of the most obvious ways is by offering more teaching support. Another way is to simply increase the number of universities that exist in the UK. This would then mean that there would be more places to accept people and there would be no need to reduce the number of students.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the number of students accepted to UK universities should not be reduced. We feel that as long as universities are able to maintain high standards of education then the number of students should be increased as the higher the number of educated professionals we have in this country the better the economy will be in the future.
