# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group was opposed to fracking. All agreed that it should not be allowed to continue, and there should be no new operations set up. In order to mitigate any damage that might be caused by existing fracking operations, and prevent any future ones from starting, it was agreed that a new regulatory framework should be established. This would be for the purpose of ensuring that the industry was not allowed complete freedom to set up operations wherever and whenever it wanted. The regulations would take into account local conditions, such as the desire for employment opportunities, as well as environmental objections. Additionally, it would ensure that fracking operations would not run counter to the government's approach to reducing dependency on fossil fuels, in order to protect the climate and mitigate against further global warming. A new framework should also ensure that fracking operations would be run as responsibly as possible, in order to protect the environment and ensure the safety of local communities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to fracking. All agreed that it should not be allowed to continue, and there should be no new operations set up. A new regulatory framework should be established to mitigate any damage caused by existing fracking operations, and prevent new ones from starting. This new framework should ensure that the fracking industry is not allowed complete freedom to set up operations wherever and whenever it wants. The regulations would take into account local conditions, such as the desire for employment opportunities, as well as environmental objections. Additionally, it would ensure that fracking operations would not run counter to the government's approach to reducing dependency on fossil fuels, in order to protect the climate and mitigate against further global warming. A new framework should also ensure that fracking operations would be run as responsibly as possible, in order to protect the environment and ensure the safety of local communities. It should also be stated that, although we all felt that a new regulatory framework was needed, it was also acknowledged that we felt it should not be as strict as possible, because we also want to protect the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be no fracking in the UK. A new regulatory framework should be established for the purpose of ensuring that the industry is not allowed complete freedom to set up operations wherever and whenever it wants. This would take into account local conditions, such as the desire for employment opportunities, as well as environmental objections. Additionally, it would ensure that fracking operations would not run counter to the government's approach to reducing dependency on fossil fuels, in order to protect the climate and mitigate against further global warming. Conclusion A consensus statement was created, representing the opinions of the group of participants. In the above example, there was disagreement between some of the participants, but through debate and discussion, a consensus was reached. The creation of the consensus statement is a very important part of the knowledge process, and is the outcome of a great deal of work. While it is important to make sure that the opinions of each individual are fully represented in the statement, it is also important that the statement is written in a way that is easy to understand. For this reason, it may be necessary to break it down into a number of shorter, separate sentences, so that it is clear exactly what each participant thinks. TIP: It is a good
