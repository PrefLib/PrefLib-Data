# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I do not think we should make it compulsory for new homes as it is an investment every household should decide on. It is an expensive investment and not everyone will be able to afford it. Maybe if there were some grants available from the government then it would be easier for most people to buy it. If the new homes will have solar panels then they will become more expensive and maybe will not be selling as fast. I do not understand why are we always focusing on homes only what about all the big companies and their buildings? These are the people earning a lot of profit and they should have solar panels. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: New homes should have solar panels for their green credentials. It would reduce reliance on the national grid and also, in the longer run, be cheaper for the user.   With the increase in adoption of supporting technologies such as house batteries (which can be charged from the solar panel) and the increased push towards electric cars these do complement each other well.  There is also already precident for this with a number of councils building green targets into planning permission (e.g. new builds must have solar panels) to gain planning approval.  It also reduces reliance on offshore energy which has been very costly for the average person in the last few years.   
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: For new homes, yes i do there are huge costs around energy and this will help solar panels are renewable energy and the way forward
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I think we should consider making solar panels compulsory. It is a sustainable way of creating electricity. This will be better for the environment and is a renewable source of energy. Although I am unsure about how much sunlight the UK gets and whether that would be conducive or an effective energy generator. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I think if they are new homes, yes. It's much easier to structure them into newer homes and makes them so much more efficient, it will save money for the buyers. However, not everyone wants them, some people don't like them and they're not always as beneficial as intended. I do think in terms of helping the environment and energy costs, it would be worth it.
