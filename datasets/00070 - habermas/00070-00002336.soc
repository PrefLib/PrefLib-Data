# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the idea of eating insects is not a good one. We do not think that it would be a good idea to encourage people to eat insects. There are other ways to help the planet that are not so drastic and would be more effective. The only way in which we think that eating insects could be a good idea is if people were to eat them in addition to their normal diet and not as a replacement. This is because insects would not provide a balanced diet and would not be sufficient to sustain life. However, insects could provide a good source of protein to supplement a normal diet. This is a better idea than encouraging people to eat insects as their only source of food.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group in general did not support the idea of encouraging the eating of insects to save the planet. The reasons for this included the fact that insects are not a very versatile food and that there are other more sustainable sources of protein that could be used instead. The group also felt that there would be a large number of people who would be put off by the idea of eating insects and so it would be very difficult to get people to eat them. However, the group did feel that insects could be used to feed livestock and so reduce the amount of meat that we need to produce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of eating insects to save the planet. We all agreed that it would be very difficult to get people to change their eating habits and that the health benefits of eating insects are not sufficient to justify the change. However, some insects are beneficial to the environment and should not be eaten.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group, in general, was opposed to the idea of eating insects to save the planet. The reasons for this included the fact that insects are not a very versatile food and that there are other more sustainable sources of protein that could be used instead. The group also felt that there would be a large number of people who would be put off by the idea of eating insects and so it would be very difficult to get people to eat them. However, the group did feel that insects could be used to feed livestock and so reduce the amount of meat that we need to produce. This idea was not shared by all participants though, as one participant felt that this would be difficult as livestock are often very selective eaters.
