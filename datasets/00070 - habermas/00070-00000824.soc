# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group was generally against the idea of switching to the Euro, as this would lead to a potential increase in prices, as seen in Ireland. The group also noted that the idea of switching currencies would not have been considered prior to Brexit, so would not be a good idea now. The group did note that the pound is not doing very well at the moment, but the Euro is not doing much better, so there is no clear winner. The group also noted that the current system works fine for the UK, and there would be no real benefits to switching. It would also take a major amount of work to change everything over to Euros instead of pounds.
