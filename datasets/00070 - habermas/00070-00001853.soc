# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the idea of reducing the working week to 3 days is a good one. However, it would be a difficult idea to implement in practice, and it would be very dependent on the sector/industry. It would be a good idea for some industries, but not for others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A 3 day working week is too short. A 4 day working week would be more appropriate, but only in sectors/industries where it would be appropriate to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although reducing the working week to three days would appear to be beneficial for employees, there are several issues that would need to be addressed prior to this change being implemented. There is a fear that by reducing the working week to 3 days, this would also lead to a significant reduction in the income for the employees, which could in turn lead to an increase in unemployment. The groups participants also felt that a reduction in the working week to 3 days, would also lead to reduced levels of customer service, which would also negatively impact on the profitability of the business. The group agreed that a compromise would be to reduce the working week to 4 days, which would still offer a work life balance to the employees, whilst still being able to provide customer service levels to the customers of the business.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is a good idea to reduce the working week to 4 days, to improve productivity and quality of life for workers.
