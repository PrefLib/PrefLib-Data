# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The internet can be a useful tool for children and adults alike. However, there are dangers online, and children can be exposed to things that they should not be. There should be some level of restriction on the internet, however, this should be limited to the most extreme cases, such as pornography, and violent material. It should not be the job of the government to be a ‘nanny state’ and restrict everything. Parents must take responsibility for what their children are exposed to. If there are extreme cases of this, then the government should be allowed to step in, but this should be a last resort.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Children under 12 should not be allowed to access certain content on the internet. We feel that some of the content, such as pornography, can be damaging to children, and we feel that they should be protected from it. We also feel that the parents should be responsible for monitoring their children, but that some restrictions should be in place to make sure that they are not accessing inappropriate content.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be some restrictions on the internet for children under 12 years old. The government should take the lead on this, but parents should also have a say on what their children can and cannot access. The internet is a wonderful resource, but there are some things that are not appropriate for children. The group of participants also made the following recommendations: The government should make a list of things that are not appropriate for children to see. This list should be agreed with by parents. The list should be regularly updated. The government should make sure that the list is adhered to. The government should also make sure that the list is made available to parents. Parents should also be responsible for making sure that their children do not access inappropriate content. The government should make sure that parents are aware of this.
