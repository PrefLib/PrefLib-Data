# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: History has often oppressed females, and for this reason gender-based language may appear to be in need of a sudden change. Language, however, changes organically and subtly, and in time we may see gender-based words removed from our language. A sudden change is not necessary and will help nobody.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Gender-based words have been part of our language for hundreds of years, and although history has often oppressed females, gender-based language remains a part of our history, culture and language. Language shifts are made organically and subtly, and this may be the case in the future that we don't have gender-based words, but a sudden change is not necessary and will help nobody.
