# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes it's the standard every business/company/employer should not only meet but to exceed. A minimum wage that is not only fair and meets the living wage would make millions of families better off and able to deal with issues better, Pay a better wage and people work harder and give a damn.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, everyone deserves to earn enough to live. Some employers will always try to exploit their employees and a minimum wage is one of the ways we can prevent this. We work hard and should be rewarded accordingly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - A minimum wage is essential to enable workers to live,, pay bills and eat. There are benefits available for low paid workers but the government  should not have to subsidise employers. Many people are unemployed and , possibly cannot afford to work on a low wage. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes due to the living crisis, we cannot expect the private sector to pay the minimum wage, there needs to be standards for businesses hiring staff in the private sector to ensure everyone in society has a baseline of wages to live on. Arguably the national minimum wage is not enough.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - Yes, we should have a minimum wage within the UK because it protects workers and ensures that those working should have the ability to look after themselves on this wage, and hopefully lift some people out of poverty. It will prevent the exploitation of workers, and prevent employers from taking advantage if a minimum wage was not enforced. The national minimum wage has also shown to improve productivity and the mental health of workers so it benefits both the employee and employer.
