# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Austerity is not a good economic policy for the UK. It has caused significant harm to the economy, where it is now widely accepted that greater public spending increases growth in the economy in all other areas and can lead to stronger growth and reduction in inflation which has caused some of the recent issues in the economic instability. It has also caused significant harm to the people of the UK, where it is now widely accepted that austerity disproportionately affects the poorer people, as they are already struggling, and this forces even harder times on these people. Trying to restrict the spending of the already worse off, creates impossibly hard decisions such as feeding yourself or feeding your children. It also negatively affects public services, creating a worse situation overall for everyone.

We believe that it is important that the government reviews its austerity policies and considers alternatives to cutting public services, so that the people of the UK can enjoy a greater quality of life and the economy can continue to grow.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Austerity is a bad economic policy for the UK. It has caused significant harm to the economy, where it is now widely accepted that greater public spending increases growth in the economy in all other areas and can lead to stronger growth and reduction in inflation which has caused some of the recent issues in the economic instability.

We would urge for a reconsideration of the current policies put in place and would look forward to an immediate review of the situation.
