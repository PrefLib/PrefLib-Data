# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not continue to have a parliament that has both a House of Commons and a House of Lords.  The current system of electing peers is not fit for purpose.  For instance, a 30 year old ex-advisor of Boris Johnson has just been elected into the House of Lords.  These people are not democratically elected and the peers do not represent a cross-section of the population.  We would prefer to just be represented by the House of Commons as at least these people have been democratically elected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the United Kingdom should continue to have a parliament that has both a House of Commons and a House of Lords.  However, the House of Lords should be elected by the people rather than appointed by the government.  This would make the House of Lords more representative of the population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The House of Lords should be made an elected chamber with a fairer method of election in order to give a voice to all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The House of Lords is undemocratic, we have a House of Commons that is a democratic institution.  Therefore, we should get rid of the House of Lords and just have the House of Commons.  However, we also feel that the House of Commons could be improved, such as having fixed term parliaments, or having constituency boundaries revised regularly, and we would like to see the government invest in technology to increase participation, such as through electronic voting, so that the system can become more modern.
