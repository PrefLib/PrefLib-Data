# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Divorce in the UK should be an easier process.  Many people get married without thinking it through properly and many people remain married when it would be better for both of them if they divorced.  The process of getting a divorce should be no more difficult than getting married and there should be adequate protections in place to ensure that both parties are not harmed in the divorce and cannot be taken advantage of.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the divorce process in the UK is too long and too expensive.  This can lead to a lot of stress and make an already difficult situation even worse.  It can also lead to people remaining in abusive relationships for longer than they would like, or to them having to spend more money than they can afford on the divorce process.  The process should be made easier, and more affordable, but there should be adequate protections in place to ensure that both parties are not harmed in the divorce and cannot be taken advantage of.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is the opinion of the group that the process of divorce should be speeded up in the UK, and the law around this process made more transparent and easier to understand. It is also the opinion of the group that divorce should be made easier for those who have suffered abuse, and that a reduced time-scale should be considered for those in this situation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While the legal process of divorce is complex, we believe that there are significant flaws in the law which need to be fixed. Firstly, the law currently allows for unilateral divorce. This means that if one party decides that they want a divorce, then that is what will happen, no matter what their spouse thinks. This is unfair. If one party wants a divorce, but the other does not, then the law should require some form of mediation between the parties, so that both are satisfied that the outcome is fair. Secondly, it is very expensive to obtain a divorce, and the law does not do enough to protect people from financial ruin. We believe that the law should allow couples to use a set of basic forms which will take them through the process of getting divorced, and should also provide for the division of property in a way that is more fair than the current system.
