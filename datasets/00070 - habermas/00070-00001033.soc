# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that plastic packaging should be phased out in the long term, but not immediately. This is because there is currently no viable alternative to plastic packaging. If the government was to implement a ban, this would lead to a significant loss of jobs in the UK. The government should instead look to provide more funding for research into new packaging alternatives. The group also believes that the government should look to implement stricter controls on the disposal of plastic packaging, with the aim of reducing the amount of plastic that ends up in landfill sites and the ocean.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a ban on plastic packaging. The reasons for this included the fact that plastic is a petroleum product, which is a finite resource, and that it is a major pollutant of the environment, particularly of the oceans. However, it was noted that plastic packaging has many advantages, such as being lightweight, and often being the most cost-effective option. The group felt that the ban should be phased in, and that there should be an awareness campaign to educate the public on the need for this. The group also felt that there should be incentives to encourage businesses to move away from plastic packaging, and that there should be a greater emphasis on recycling.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Plastic packaging, both its usage and manufacturing should be discontinued as soon as possible. Microplastics are permeating every level of the food chain and wreaking havoc on the natural world. Plastic is however rather hard to replace and there is currently no cheaper or more efficient alternative. As such a lot of research should be on how to effectively switch to more sustainable options. The country is not in a position to immediately move to a blanket ban. Once alternative solutions are in place, we can look to phase it out.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that the production of plastic packaging should not be banned. However, the use of plastic packaging should be reduced as much as possible. This can be done by introducing a tax on plastic packaging and by using more recyclable materials. This will reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills and oceans.
