# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The average Briton’s attitude to the Chinese government is one of hostility, but not unjustifiably so. The Chinese government is responsible for appalling human rights abuses, including their treatment of Uyghurs, and they are known to spy on the West. Furthermore, their lack of action and dishonesty at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic arguably helped the virus travel around the world instead of being contained. However, the average Briton is largely uneducated about China’s government, as we don't get much information on them.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “The average Briton's attitude to the Chinese government is hostile. The Chinese government is often blamed for Covid-19 and its treatment of the Uyghurs. The average Briton is also suspicious of the Chinese government's lack of transparency and its close ties with Russia. However, there are some who are supportive of the Chinese government, as they believe that the Chinese government has handled Covid-19 well, and that it has a right to censor content, as long as it does not violate human rights.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The average Briton’s attitude to the Chinese government is one of suspicion and fear. The Chinese government’s human rights abuses, mistreatment of Uyghurs, and its lack of transparency and honesty at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic have led to a hostile attitude from the average Briton. However, the average Briton is largely uneducated about the Chinese government, and so their attitude is largely based on misinformation and a lack of transparency from the Chinese government.
