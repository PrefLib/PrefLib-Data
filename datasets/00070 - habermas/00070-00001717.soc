# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Petrol prices are already too high and we should not raise taxes on petrol. We should however tax people on the mileage they drive annually or on the type of car they drive e.g. SUV or 4x4 owners should be taxed higher if they choose those types of vehicles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The price of petrol is a contentious issue in today’s world, with its fluctuating costs and environmental impact, however, increasing taxes is not the solution. Due to the significant impact on the cost of living, increasing taxes on petrol is not a viable option. Whilst it may encourage a more efficient use of oil, it does not address the damage already done to the environment by this. In the short term, raising taxes is not the solution. However, the current system does not incentivise sustainable transport solutions and needs to be updated in order to allow our public transport system to be as efficient as possible. In the long term, an overhaul of the tax system and public transport system is needed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to an increase in tax on petrol. The reasons for this included the fact that many people rely on their cars to get to work, to access services and to provide care for family members. The group felt that the current cost of living crisis is already crippling people and that an increase in tax on petrol would have a significant impact on people's abilities to go to work or travel to provide care for family members. The group felt that the public transport network is not reliable or robust enough to support a significant increase in users if car owners are not able to afford to fill their tanks. The group felt that there are other ways to encourage people to use their cars less, such as by encouraging the use of public transport and by making it easier for people to cycle and walk. The group felt that there are other ways to reduce our impact on the environment, such as by encouraging the use of public transport and by making it easier for people to cycle and walk. The group felt that it would be better to encourage the use of public transport and to make it easier for people to cycle and walk, rather than to increase the tax on petrol.
