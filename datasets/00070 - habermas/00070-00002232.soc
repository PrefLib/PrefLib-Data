# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, MPs should not be able to claim expenses for a second home. However, MPs who live a significant distance from Westminster (e.g., all Scottish MPs and those living in the north of England) should be able to claim for a second home in order to carry out their duties. Also, these claims should be limited by the fact that the home must be rented below the average cost of homes in the region and there should also be a cap on the cost of the home that can be claimed for. The consensus was strongly in favour of this and we saw no evidence of any attempt to force anyone's opinion to the ground. This is strong evidence that Delphi need not be a consensus-forcing process.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - MPs should not be able to claim expenses for a second home. This would ensure that MPs from all over the country are treated equally. We believe that MPs already receive a generous income and should not require a second home in order to carry out their duties. However, there should be some exceptions to this rule. For example, if an MP lived a long way from Westminster, they should be able to claim for a second home. The group felt that the current system was open to abuse and that there should be a distance limit and a cap on the amount that could be claimed. We believe that MPs from all over the country should be treated equally and that no MP should be able to claim for a second home. However, we also believe that the current system is open to abuse and that a new system must be put in place. We believe that the new system should be strict and should not allow for MPs to claim for an excessively large or grand house.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of MPs being able to claim expenses for a second home. The group felt that MPs were already well paid and should not be claiming for a second home. However, the group felt that there should be some exceptions to this rule. For example, if an MP lived a long way from Westminster, they should be able to claim for a second home. The group felt that the current system was open to abuse and that there should be a distance limit and a cap on the amount that could be claimed.
