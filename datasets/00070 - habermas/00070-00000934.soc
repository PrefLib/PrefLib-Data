# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that the UK should ban products that have been tested on animals. The benefits of testing on animals are not worth the suffering that the animals go through. There are alternatives such as computer modelling which could be used instead. The UK is a developed country and should not support such a cruel practice. We would also like to stress that testing on animals should be banned for cosmetic purposes only. For medical research, animal testing is essential as a last resort.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Products should be made safe for humans but I don't believe they should be tested on animals. The suffering which the animals go through seems so cruel that the benefits are not worth it in my opinion. There are alternatives such as computer modelling which could be used instead. The UK is a developed country and should not support such a cruel practice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that the UK should ban products that have been tested on animals. We agree that the benefits of testing on animals are not worth the suffering that the animals go through. There are alternatives such as computer modelling which could be used instead. The UK is a developed country and should not support such a cruel practice. We also think that testing on animals should be allowed for essential medicines, such as vaccines, because it could be a matter of life and death.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that the UK should ban products that have been tested on animals. The benefits of testing on animals are not worth the suffering that the animals go through. There are alternatives such as computer modelling which could be used instead. The UK is a developed country and should not support such a cruel practice. We have not come to a complete consensus, however, and Participant 4 believes that testing should be allowed for essential medicines, but cosmetics testing should be banned.
