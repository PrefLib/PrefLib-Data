# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should have a nuclear power industry. We should not be running fossil fuel power plants because they are bad for the environment.  We need more green energy sources but we need to rely on nuclear power as the next best alternative until green energy can take over.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the UK having a nuclear power industry.  The reasons for this were that nuclear power is a clean source of energy and is much better for the environment than fossil fuels.  The group was aware of the dangers of nuclear power and the potential for accidents but felt that these were outweighed by the benefits of having a nuclear power industry.  The group felt that it was important that the government was working to increase the amount of green energy in the UK and that nuclear power would be phased out in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although it is better for the environment, nuclear power is a dangerous thing. Accidents can occur such as Chernobyl.  The fact that it produces radioactive waste is a very worrying thing also. We shouldn't run more fossil fuel power plants because they are so harmful to the environment.  We obviously want more green energy sources but while the government is slowly increasing our green energy capacity we have to rely on nuclear power as the next best alternative.  Hopefully it will be phased out in the future as we move to 100% green energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should not have a nuclear power industry.  Although it is more environmentally friendly than some of the alternatives, nuclear power is dangerous to our people and the environment.  If a power plant were to experience a meltdown it would be catastrophic.  There is also the issue of the radioactive waste which is hazardous to both our health and our environment.  The problem with the nuclear power industry is that there is no 100% safe solution, in the event of an accident there is no going back.
