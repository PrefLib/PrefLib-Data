# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, it is wrong to pay people different wages for doing the same work. The most common justification for people being paid different wages for doing the same work is their amount of seniority or experience in the workplace. Seniority and experience should not be the only determining factor when it comes to wages. Paying people different wages for doing the same work leads to inequality in the workplace and this is something that should be avoided. It is important to note that there are some exceptions to this, for example, if a person is new to a workplace and has no experience, it would be acceptable to pay this employee less and gradually increase their wages over time to match that of more experienced workers doing the same job role.  This will also help less experienced employees be given a chance where as they might otherwise be overlooked in the hiring process for more experienced workers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, it is wrong to pay people different wages for doing the same work.

It is important to note that there are some exceptions to this, for example, if a person is new to a workplace and has no experience, it would be acceptable to pay this employee less and gradually increase their wages over time to match that of more experienced workers doing the same job role.  This will also help less experienced employees be given a chance where as they might otherwise be overlooked in the hiring process for more experienced workers.  However, the group also emphasized that experience alone should not be a factor in whether someone is paid a lower or higher wage.

The Delphi Technique The Delphi Technique is a method of achieving a consensus of opinion of a group of experts on a particular subject. This is a highly structured approach, in which the experts don't interact directly with each other and a facilitator is used to run the process.  This technique has a number of important advantages.  These include the fact that people can answer the questions at their own time and pace, it is cheap to run, no travel is required, experts are able to maintain their anonymity and it can be used
