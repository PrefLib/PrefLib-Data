# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to an outright ban on the sale of soft drinks that are high in sugar.  Rather, the group felt that the sale of these products should be more tightly regulated and that the public should be educated on the dangers of consuming these products.  The group also felt that the government should provide incentives for manufacturers to reduce the sugar content of their products and to offer healthier alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to an outright ban on the sale of soft drinks that are high in sugar.  Rather, the group believed that the sale of such drinks should be regulated in terms of the sugar content of the drinks and that this should be accompanied by an education programme aimed at the general public.  The group believed that the manufacturers of such drinks would only respond to legislation or pressure from consumers, not for requests to do the right thing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People have the right to buy what they want. The government needs to provide the public with enough information for them to make informed choices and I think that education is the key to a healthier society. I don't think a ban would be effective.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While the sale of soft drinks which are high in sugar should not be banned, there is a need for better regulation in this area.  However, we believe that education is the key, and there needs to be more public awareness on the negative health consequences of drinking sugary soft drinks.  A general public health campaign which shows the facts is essential to getting people to make better choices for their health.  Manufacturers should be encouraged to promote reduced sugar alternatives, and their labeling and packaging should make it easier for people to make informed decisions on what they buy.
