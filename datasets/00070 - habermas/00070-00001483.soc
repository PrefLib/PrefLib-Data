# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of abolishing private schools.  It was felt that the current system is unfair and that the quality of education is not necessarily better in private schools.  However, it was also felt that private schools do provide a valuable service for those who can afford them.  Therefore, it was felt that the current system should be maintained but that private schools should be taxed to provide funding for public schools.  This funding should be ring-fenced and made available only for use in public schools.  In addition, it was felt that there should be a system for moving between the public and private school systems, allowing students to move freely between the two.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be no private schools, however, the current system is so entrenched that we must retain it.  Private schools should be heavily taxed to provide funding for public schools.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We generally agree with the draft consensus statement, however, given the complexities involved and the need for further research, the group was unable to commit to saying that private schools should be abolished.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of abolishing private schools.  It was felt that the current system is unfair and that the quality of education is not necessarily better in private schools.  However, it was also felt that private schools do provide a valuable service for those who can afford them.  Therefore, it was felt that the current system should be maintained but that private schools should be taxed to provide funding for public schools.  It was further felt that the tax revenue from private schools should not be given to the government to be distributed at its own whim, but rather be given directly to the public schools in order to provide them with the funds they require to provide a quality education to their students.
