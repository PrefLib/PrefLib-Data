# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not fair to use animals to test new chemicals, and where possible alternatives to this should be used. Where it is not possible to use alternatives, animal testing should only be performed when it is not harmful and only where necessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No I do not think that it is.  This is because I do not see what right humans have to do such a thing.  Just because we are more intelligent does that give us more right?  If a more intelligent alien race came and wanted to test their chemicals on us, would they be justified to do so?  It is exploitation and is unethical.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the safety of the public must be the first priority when it comes to releasing new chemicals into the world. This means that some level of animal testing is necessary to ensure this safety. However, testing on animals should be the last resort, and should only be used if there is no other alternative.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Animal testing should be avoided wherever possible, but if necessary it should be done with all efforts made to reduce suffering.
