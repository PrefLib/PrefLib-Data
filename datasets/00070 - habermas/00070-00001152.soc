# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should limit the number of times a person can run for political office. This will reduce political corruption and introduce more fresh ideas and ways of looking at things. It will prevent political figures becoming complacent in their jobs, and therefore ensure a more efficient political system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the number of times a person can run for political office should be limited.  This ensures a system that is constantly refreshed with new people and new ideas, and prevents a complacent political class from forming.  It also ensures that younger politicians with more of a link to their electorates and can represent them better have a chance at office, and is more democratic overall.  There are some exceptions to this rule, however.  If a politician has been in good standing and has been a good political figure, they should be able to run as many times as they want.  The only time a politician should be restricted from running for office is if they act in bad faith and haven't been truthful to the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should not limit the number of times a person can run for political office.  This is because there are no good reasons to do so, and many bad ones.  A politician who has been in office for a long time has a wealth of experience that cannot be matched by someone new to the role.  There are often limits on how long one person can hold an office, and that should be the focus.  If a person is not elected, then it shows that they are not good at the job, and so should not be in office.  The people have spoken, and their choice should be respected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that there should be limits on the amount of times a person can run for political office. This ensures that there is a higher degree of political turnover and prevents complacency in political leaders, which can lead to a decline in the quality of government. It also means that there is a greater possibility for more diverse voices to be heard, as many people will have the opportunity to take the reigns of government and offer new policies and ideas. In many countries, limits are put in place to stop politicians becoming too powerful, and to make the political system more democratic and representative of the wider population.
