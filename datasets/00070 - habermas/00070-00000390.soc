# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Parents should have the right to choose their children’s school, however a balanced system should be in place so that each school has a fair amount of students. This could be achieved by having a set of “tie-breakers” in place which gives preference to certain groups (e.g. siblings, disadvantaged families, disadvantaged areas). Parents should also have the right to withdraw their child from a school if the situation warrants it. This should be closely monitored and there should be a process in place for the child to return to school at a later stage.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Parental rights should be exercised with care. The well-being of the child should be the ultimate goal, and parents should be careful to ensure that any decisions they make are in their child's best interests. Parental rights should be balanced with the child’s right to education. The child's interests are paramount. A consensus view: Parental rights should be exercised with care. The well-being of the child should be the ultimate goal, and parents should be careful to ensure that any decisions they make are in their child's best interests. Parental rights should be balanced with the child’s right to education. The child's interests are paramount.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Parents should have the right to choose their children’s schools, but this should be limited. Parents should be given the right to choose the best schools that are suited to their child’s interests and their own interests. However, there are some schools which have a bad reputation, and parents should not have the right to send their children there. Schools should also be within reasonable distance. Parents should not be allowed to choose a school that is situated a long way away from their home and thus causes inconvenience for their child. A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, parents should have the right to choose the school their children attend. This is in the best interests of the child and will allow them to flourish. In order to accommodate this right, every school should have an equal range of facilities and resources so that parents are not forced to make a choice based on necessity. However, this right should not be completely absolute. If a school is over-subscribed, then children should be allocated a school via a lottery system. If a school has a poor academic record, then parents should not be able to opt out of it - their child should attend the local school. This will ensure that children are given a fair chance to learn.
