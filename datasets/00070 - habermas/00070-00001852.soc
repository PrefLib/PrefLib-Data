# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No. Social media should be about free speech and expressing opinions on any subject including political advertising. If other types of advertising are allowed so should political advertising be allowed. All advertising should be treated equally. That being said all sides of any political subject should be allowed equally. However, we do feel that all political advertising should be clearly signedposted as such and all parties must be treated equally. We believe that political adverts can have a negative effect on mental health as political parties never do what is right for the people. They just do what is right for their party. We are concerned that social media is manipulated and easily targeted those that are easily influenced and that it can be used to spread misinformation. We would like to see social media platforms make it easier for the public to report anything they see that could be classed as political advertising.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Political advertising should be banned from social media.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that political advertising on social media should be banned. The reason for this is that it is easy to manipulate and target people on social media, and it can have a negative effect on people’s mental health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to a ban on political advertising on social media. They felt that it was important for people to be able to express their views, and that it was important for people to be able to see the views of others. They did however feel that there should be a level playing field, and that all political parties should be able to advertise equally. They also felt that there should be some regulation on the content of political advertising, to ensure that it is not misleading or untruthful.
