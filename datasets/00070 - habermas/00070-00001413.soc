# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There was a feeling among the group that the tax rate on higher earners could be raised, but only under certain conditions. It was felt that those earning more than a certain amount of money, probably around £200,000 per year, should be taxed more highly. This was seen as a reasonable amount to live on and therefore, anything more should be taxed at a higher rate. However, the participants did not think that the tax rate should be too high, as there would be no incentive for people to work hard and do well. The group thought that if a person is a hard worker and spends all their money, it should be seen as more acceptable than someone who stores their wealth in a savings account and does not put money back into the economy. The group thought that raising the tax rate on higher earners was fair, but thought that it should be done carefully and gradually.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It was the opinion of the group that high earners should be taxed at a higher rate. The group felt that, in this country, it is not necessary to earn more than £200,000 per year to live a comfortable life. Therefore, the group thought that people who earn more than this amount should be taxed highly to prevent inequality in our society. The participants did not think that the tax rate should be too high, as it is a right of people to be able to work hard and then profit from their work. The group thought that if people earn a lot of money and then spend all of it, it should be seen as more acceptable than someone who stores their wealth in a savings account and does not put money back into the economy. However, the group thought that the tax rate on high earners should be raised, but only gradually.
