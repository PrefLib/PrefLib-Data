# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should rejoin the European Union.  This is because the EU is the most effective means of promoting good relations among the members it predisposes members to trade with each other.  Leaving has left to a loss of goodwill.  We are stronger together economically, politically and militarily.  The UK has not seen any benefits of leaving the EU.  Instead it has only seen problems and disbenefits.  It appears to have harmed our economy and kept us outside of the decision making in Europe.  The main item used in the vote to leave (people entering UK) does not seem to have been solved.  This all seems to suggest we were better in the EU and hence we should seek to rejoin.  The question might be less should we rejoin and more how we rejoin and hence under what terms.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of rejoining the EU, however, they felt that it was important to consider the terms of re-entry. They felt that the referendum was poorly considered and that it would be good to hold another referendum with a more balanced question. They felt that the EU was fundamentally undemocratic, but that it was an effective means of promoting good relations among the members and that it predisposed members to trade with each other. They felt that the EU was damaging to people and the planet, but that it was also a good way of promoting democracy and that it was an effective means of promoting good relations among the members and that it predisposed members to trade with each other. They felt that the EU was fundamentally undemocratic & mired with bureaucracy.  Its policies of neo-liberalism are damaging to people & the planet, causing mass destruction of the environment & tearing up communities.  They felt that we should be using brexit as an opportunity to do things that the E.U. wouldn't have allowed such as mass state investment in the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group came to the consensus view that the UK should rejoin the EU. The participants felt that the UK has suffered economically and politically since leaving the EU. They felt that the UK would be stronger if it was part of the EU and that the UK would be better able to influence EU policy if it was a member. The participants also felt that the UK has suffered a loss of status since leaving the EU. They felt that the UK is no longer seen as a world leader and that this has damaged the UK's standing in the world. The participants felt that the UK should rejoin the EU but that the UK should negotiate a better deal than it had previously. They felt that the UK should be able to control its borders but that it should be able to trade freely with the EU. The participants felt that the UK should be able to control its laws but that it should be able to trade freely with the EU. The participants felt that the UK should rejoin the EU but that it should be able to control its laws and borders.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a new referendum on whether the UK should rejoin the EU.  The referendum should be conducted in a way that allows for a more nuanced response than the binary choice of remain or leave.  It should allow for the possibility of rejoining with conditions, or rejoining with no conditions.  It should also allow for the possibility of leaving with no deal, or leaving with a deal.  The referendum should be conducted in a way that allows for a more nuanced response than the binary choice of remain or leave.  It should allow for the possibility of rejoining with conditions, or rejoining with no conditions.  It should also allow for the possibility of leaving with no deal, or leaving with a deal.
