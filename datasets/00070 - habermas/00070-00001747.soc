# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Yes, the UK should raise taxes on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service. The NHS is an essential service that is underfunded. The government has made many cuts to the NHS budget, and this has led to increased waiting times and poorer care for patients. The NHS is a crucial part of British society, and it is important that it receives adequate funding to provide high-quality healthcare to all citizens. Raising taxes on high earners would be a sensible approach to increase NHS funding. The NHS is a public service that should be accessible to all, regardless of income. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask people who earn a lot to contribute a bit more to support the NHS. Of course, any tax policy should be carefully designed to balance the need for funding with the potential impact on the economy and overall societal well-being. In this way, the Delphi method is very useful for developing a consensus opinion, as it allows all participants to be involved in the process, and they can provide critiques of each draft and have their say in shaping the final consensus opinion. Each participant has an equal voice and gets to share their opinion. No opinion is dismissed, and each opinion is taken into
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that, in the view of the debt the NHS is running, the problem should be paid for by higher taxes, which is only fair for those earning a high salary. However, this might hamper economic growth, not just for the individual but for the country as a whole. People in such jobs often spend much of their income, thus their tax revenues are widely dispersed in the economy. An increase in tax for those with such a high wage might stymie their growth, in addition to dampening the economy. Rather than this, raising the tax threshold might be a better option, due to the economic growth this might create. More tax revenues would come from the newly wealthy, and this could be funnelled in to the NHS. It's easy for this group to say this when we don't have children/are quite young. However, it is important to remember that people might have a family dependent on them. It is not fair to put tax rises that might result in substantial cutbacks on to these people.

Therefore, it is reasonable to ask people who earn a lot to contribute a bit more to support the NHS. However, it is crucial to understand that the amount of tax the rich pay in absolute terms is much less than the amount of tax the poor pay, and raising their taxes may lead to a contraction in the economy and reduced funds available for healthcare in the long run. It is vital that any policy to increase tax on the rich is well thought out to avoid unintended negative consequences and ensure sustainable funding for healthcare.”

It is also important to recognize that the NHS faces serious challenges beyond funding and that reforming the NHS requires a comprehensive approach that involves multiple stakeholders and solutions.
