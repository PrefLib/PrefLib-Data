# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The internet has been a net positive for humanity. It has provided a vast library of knowledge and information for all to access. It has connected people and communities around the world. It has allowed for the sharing of ideas and thoughts. However, there are negatives. The internet has been used to spread misinformation, lies and propaganda. It has been used to groom and exploit children. It has been used to spread hate and division. The internet has been a net positive for humanity, but it is not without its dangers. Conclusion A consensus statement is more than just a majority opinion. It is a view that all participants agree is the best possible outcome for the group, even if it is not the view of the majority. A consensus statement is reached through a process of debate and dialogue, where all participants have a voice and where the goal is to come to a single view that all participants can accept.

However, there was some concern that the process had been too long and arduous. It was suggested that if this process was to be used in the future, it should be condensed into a shorter and more streamlined process.
