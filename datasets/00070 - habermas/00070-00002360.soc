# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, it is not ok to use tax havens.  This is because it is a way of avoiding paying taxes that you should be paying.  It is also a way of avoiding paying taxes that are used to fund services that you use.  The issue is not that tax havens exist, but that they are used by the wealthiest individuals and biggest companies to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.  This is morally wrong and is also unfair on the less wealthy individuals and smaller companies that have to pay higher taxes to compensate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the conclusion that it is not ok to use tax havens.  We feel that it is unfair that some people can use tax havens and avoid paying tax, when others cannot.  This means that those who cannot use tax havens have to pay higher taxes to compensate for those that do not pay their fair share.  It is also unfair that those that use tax havens are likely to be the wealthiest individuals/biggest companies and so it doesn't seem right that they can benefit from tax havens when others cannot.  This is a problem with the rules about using tax havens rather than the existence of them.  If it is legal to use tax havens then it is ok to use them, but we do not think that it is right that it is legal to use tax havens.  It is a moral issue and we believe that everyone should be paying their fair share of tax, based on their earnings.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that it is not ok to use tax havens.  The main reason for this is that it is unfair that the wealthiest people/biggest companies are able to avoid paying tax when others are not.  The government needs tax money to provide services for the country and so it is not right that some people are able to avoid paying their fair share.  We also think that it is not ok to use tax havens because it is often the case that tax havens are used to launder money from illegal activities.  This means that the government is losing out on tax money and it also means that the tax havens are allowing people to get away with illegal activities.  We think that the rules about tax havens should be tightened so that it is not possible for people to use them to avoid paying tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that it is not ok to use tax havens.  We feel that the use of tax havens is morally wrong as it means that people are not paying their fair share of tax and are therefore not contributing to society.  We feel that this is especially the case for the very wealthy who can afford to pay their taxes.  We feel that the use of tax havens is also not ok as it means that the less wealthy have to pay higher taxes to compensate for those that are avoiding paying their taxes.  We feel that the use of tax havens is also not ok as it means that those that are using tax havens are getting an unfair advantage over those that are not.  We feel that the use of tax havens is also not ok as it means that the government has less money to spend on public services and other things that would benefit society as a whole.
