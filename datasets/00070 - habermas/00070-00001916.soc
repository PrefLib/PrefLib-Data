# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government needs to regulate certain online content because so many people could be negatively influenced by bad content, including young people, however free speech is very important and should be protected as much as possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is important that the government regulate certain online content to prevent things such as illegal pornography and racism and hate speech. There needs to be some regulation to make sure that children and younger people do not see things that could affect their behaviour. Free speech is very important and so is the ability to publish things that one might find offensive but not illegal. It is very important that we regulate the content that is illegal and that is used to manipulate young people or anyone else into committing a crime or doing something that they would not otherwise do. It is also very important that we protect free speech and the right to express our opinions online, no matter how unpopular they might be, and also to protect the right to access content online that might not be to everyone's liking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is important that the government regulate certain online content to prevent things such as illegal pornography and racism and hate speech. There needs to be some regulation to make sure that children and younger people do not see things that could affect their behaviour. Free speech is very important and so is the ability to publish things that one might find offensive but not illegal. It is very important that we regulate the content that is illegal and that is used to manipulate young people or anyone else into committing a crime or doing something that they would not otherwise do. We also need to protect the right to free speech as much as possible and the right of adults to express themselves even if others may find it offensive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There needs to be regulation of certain online content in order to protect the vulnerable and to stop people from being manipulated by others to do harm. Children should not have access to online content that might affect their behaviour, such as pornography and hate speech. The right to free speech is very important and should be protected as much as possible, but there are certain things that cannot be allowed to be said and published and these things need to be regulated.
