# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of paying people to recycle.  However, it was recognised that some people will not recycle unless they are paid to do so.  In these cases, it may be necessary to pay a small amount to these people in order to encourage them to recycle.  This will hopefully lead to a reduction in the amount of waste going to landfill sites.  It was also suggested that it may be a good idea to make it compulsory for businesses to recycle.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that people should be incentivised to recycle in some way, but that a monetary payment is probably not the most effective way. This is because many people may simply do the bare minimum if a payment was in place and as such this would not actually be the best way of achieving the desired outcome. More effective ways of incentivising the behaviour change we are looking for could include ways of social influencing, so that there is a sense of peer pressure to recycle, as well as promoting the environmental benefits of doing so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group came to the consensus view that we should not be paid to recycle.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the decision that the government should not pay people to recycle. We think that it is the responsibility of each person to recycle and that this should be done without the need for any financial incentive. However, we also think that the government should do more to encourage people to recycle and that this could be done by making recycling more accessible to people. We think that this could be done by making recycling more accessible to people. We think that this could be done by having more recycling bins in public places and by making it easier for people to recycle at home. We also think that the government should do more to educate people about the importance of recycling and the impact that not recycling has on the environment.
