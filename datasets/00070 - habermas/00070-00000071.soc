# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Pesticides have a clear benefit in terms of protecting crops, but can have a devastating impact on bees. A ban on all pesticides is not the best solution, as pesticides have a vital role to play in food production. However, alternative solutions to harmful pesticides should be sought and some pesticides may be harmful enough to warrant a ban.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the use of pesticides should be kept to a minimum. However, if there is no other way to grow crops to feed people then it should be considered as an option. Pesticides should be used as a last resort. The use of pesticides should be carefully considered and only if necessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be a ban on pesticides that are harmful to local wildlife and to bee populations in particular.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Pesticides should be banned where they are found to cause irreparable harm to bees, otherwise the benefits of using them for crop production are greater.
