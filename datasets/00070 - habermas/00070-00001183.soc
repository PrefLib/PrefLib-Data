# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: The group were very strongly in favour of requiring companies to disclose the technology they use to identify users. The most important factor they came up with was transparency. The whole issue was seen as being about informed consent and transparency. By disclosing the technology they use, it allows us to make an informed choice about whether to use the software and what information to divulge to them. It also puts us in a better position to understand how we can be traced by online advertisers and what our rights are with regards to how our information is used. This transparency can only be achieved by the companies disclosing the technology they use. We all believed that it is extremely important to inform users, and agreed that if a company decided not to inform them, then that decision should be punished heavily by law.

By disclosing the technology they use, it allows us to make an informed choice about whether to use the software and what information to divulge to them.

It also protects us against the possibility of companies abusing our data by using the technology without our knowledge.
