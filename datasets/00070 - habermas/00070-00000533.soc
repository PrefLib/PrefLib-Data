# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of remaining in the EU but thought that it was too late to change this. This was because of the many political and economic implications that would have to be accounted for and because of the time it would take for the UK to rejoin the EU. The group thought that it was important to maintain the momentum that had been built up since Brexit and that it was important to focus on the future rather than the past.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: YES. The UK should seek to rejoin the EU.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There has been some unexpected negative impacts of Brexit. However, the UK needs to continue on its course to recovery. In the future, the UK needs to be open to ideas and opportunities and take more risks, however there is also a need to consider the long-term implications of a decision and future opportunities that it may bring. The views expressed by each participant are those of the individual participant and not those of anyone else.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group felt that the UK should seek to re-join the EU. This is because they felt that the UK economy has suffered as a result of leaving the EU and that the EU is a powerful economic bloc. They felt that it would be difficult for the UK to remain outside the EU and be able to compete with other countries in the EU. They also felt that it would be important for the UK to work closely with the EU in the future in order to ensure its economic success. They felt that they were more comfortable with the idea of being in the EU rather than being outside of it and that they would prefer to re-join rather than remain outside. Finally, the group felt that they would like to see a second referendum, once the effects of Brexit were more fully known. This is because they felt that the UK had voted to leave the EU based on a campaign that had not been fully honest with people and that there had been a lot of scaremongering in the lead up to the vote. They felt that the UK public would not be prepared to leave the EU if they knew how it would affect the economy, and therefore they should be given a chance to vote once the effects of Brexit were fully known
