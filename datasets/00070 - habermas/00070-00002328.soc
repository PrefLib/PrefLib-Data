# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “We should not abolish private property as generational wealth is important in this country. It provides an incentive to work harder and longer, if you believe your earnings will be passed on to loved ones. Abolishing private property will lead toward Socialism/Communism, and historically those countries have not fared well in the long term. If there is little incentive to work, then the society will be less productive. However, we should introduce a cap on the level of wealth that can be accumulated intergenerationally to ensure that the rich-poor divide is not exacerbated by large levels of inherited wealth. This cap should be set at a level that will allow the average person to accumulate a small amount of wealth, but not enough to live off for the rest of their life. This will ensure that the majority of the population continues to work hard and contribute to society, whilst also ensuring that the 1% do not continue to get richer and richer.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “We should not abolish private property as generational wealth is important in this country. It provides an incentive to work harder and longer, if you believe your earnings will be passed on to loved ones. Abolishing private property will lead toward Socialism/Communism, and historically those countries have not fared well in the long term. If there is little incentive to work, then the society will be less productive. However, there should be more access to affordable housing so that most sections of the population have the opportunity to buy their own home. Having bought a modest home, it should be up to the homeowner whether any of this wealth can be accumulated intergenerationally. There should be a limit on intergenerational wealth to stop the 1% getting richer and richer. It would help with the rich-poor divide. A limit of £1 million, for example, would help to reduce the gap between the rich and poor.”

Abolishing private property will lead toward Socialism/Communism, and historically those countries have not fared well in the long term. If there is little incentive to work, then the society will be less productive. However, we should ensure that everyone has the opportunity to buy their own home, and to do so at an affordable price. This will allow a level of intergenerational wealth to be accumulated by most sections of the population.”
