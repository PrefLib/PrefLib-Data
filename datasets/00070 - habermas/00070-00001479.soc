# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, we feel that the UK is still a Christian country, but that the country is slowly moving away from being a Christian country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK is still a Christian country, but the population is slowly moving away from religion. We still celebrate all of the Christian holidays such as Christmas, Easter and have them as bank holidays. We still bless the King via the national anthem saying, "God bless". The population are slowly moving away from being a Christian country but the country as a whole is a full Christian Country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although the country is still considered a Christian country, with a high percentage of the population claiming to be Christian, the actual number of practising Christians has dropped significantly over recent years.  This is due to several reasons including a drop in organised religion and people becoming more spiritual rather than religious. The UK has also opened its borders to refugees, which has led to the creation of more multicultural towns and cities. With this, there has been a rise in other religions, which has reduced the dominance of Christianity in the country.
