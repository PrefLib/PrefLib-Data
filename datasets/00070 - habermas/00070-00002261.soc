# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the number of skilled workers allowed into the country. The group felt that this would be beneficial to the economy, and also to the existing skilled workers in the country who may be struggling to cope with the workload. The group also felt that it was important to ensure that the skilled workers coming into the country were being paid a fair wage, and that they were not taking jobs away from existing skilled workers. The group felt that it was important to focus on the areas where there was a shortage of skilled workers, and to ensure that the skilled workers coming into the country were able to fill those roles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the number of skilled workers allowed into the country. The group felt that it was important to ensure that existing workers were not being exploited and that there was a balance of skilled workers from a variety of backgrounds. The group also felt that it was important to ensure that existing workers were not being exploited and that there was a balance of skilled workers from a variety of backgrounds.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is important that the country has a high number of skilled workers to help sustain the economy. At the moment we have a good balance of skills, knowledge and experience within the country, however, there are still a few areas in which we are not able to fill jobs due to a lack of the required skills. We have tried to encourage more people to learn the skills that are required but have been unsuccessful. This is where we believe that increasing the immigration of skilled workers would be beneficial. This is because these workers are able to come into the country and make a good contribution, often by working in jobs where we are unable to find people with the skills. It is also important that they do not take away jobs from our people, so it is important that we maintain a balance of immigrants to existing workers. As a group, we all agree that our country would benefit from increasing the number of skilled workers that we allow into the country. However, we believe that it is important that the existing population in our country is given a chance to also improve their skills. For this reason, we believe that we should focus on improving the skills of the existing population before we open up our borders to more skilled workers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that we should change our immigration policy to allow a higher number of skilled workers into the country, but only in areas where we are really struggling to find people. We need to ensure that we are able to employ these workers without harming the prospects of others in the country, and that they are able to receive the same support that is available to other workers.
