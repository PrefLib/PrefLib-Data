# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The UK government should spend money on research into space travel. This is because it is important for the future of the human race and inspires the next generation of scientists.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although the UK government should not spend money on research into space travel, it should invest in the education of space travel and the potential it holds for future generations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Space travel is an important and necessary thing for humanity. It is an important scientific pursuit, but also could be vital for the survival of our species. With a growing population and climate change, we may need to look to other planets for resources or to move to. Therefore I believe the government should support research into space travel, but also encourage private sector companies to get involved and invest their own money.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that the UK government should spend money on research into space travel. We believe this because it is important for humanity to be able to explore the universe, and this can lead to important scientific breakthroughs.
