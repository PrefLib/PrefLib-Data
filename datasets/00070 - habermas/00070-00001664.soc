# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We don't think it is right to use recreational drugs. Recreational drugs can have a negative impact on a person's life and health. Therefore, we don't think it is right to use recreational drugs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the use of recreational drugs is wrong. This is because they are illegal and can lead to addiction and crime. They can also lead to the use of illegal drugs as the individual might need to move on to stronger drugs to have the same effect. They can also lead to an addiction to these drugs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the use of recreational drugs is wrong. The use of recreational drugs is directly linked to an increase in crime - both violent and non violent. Recreational drugs are highly addictive and can cause people to act in ways they normally wouldn't. It can cause people's behaviour to change completely and make them more paranoid, angry and violent. Also people can easily get addicted and their lives can be ruined easily because of drugs. They can no longer hold down jobs because all they can think about is their next hit. This means they end up living on the street and can turn to crime to fund their drug habit.They may turn to jobs such as prostitution or join gangs as a way to make money - both of these contribute to increased levels of crime and this makes society a worse and more dangerous place.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: While the legalisation of all drugs is not supported by the group, some members were open to the idea of decriminalisation, where drugs are not criminalised but their possession, sale and use are still offences. Although the group generally agreed that it is wrong to use recreational drugs, the general view was that cannabis is the least harmful and most widely used recreational drug. This was considered the exception to the rule and the consensus was that the possession of cannabis for personal use should not be criminalised. The group felt that it was also important to note that there is a strong link between poverty and the use of recreational drugs, and that the drug laws need to be looked at as a whole. The group felt that this link between poverty and the use of recreational drugs must be considered in the debate, and was another factor that showed that the war on drugs had failed.
