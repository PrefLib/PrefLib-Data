# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that we are not in favour of raising the retirement age to 68.  We have discussed the health implications of working longer, the lack of jobs for young people, and the strain on the NHS and care homes if the elderly are not able to retire.  We believe that the government should look at other ways to save money, such as reducing the salaries of MP's and those in the House of Lords to a more normal and socially acceptable level, and reducing expense limits available to politicians.  We also believe that the government should look at other ways to generate revenue from tax-avoiding corporations and billionaires rather than the working people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to raising the retirement age to 68.  It was felt that this would be unfair to those in this age bracket who may not be able to work due to ill health or caring responsibilities.  It was felt that it would be unfair to force people to work longer, especially when they may be in less physically able to do so.  It was felt that it would be unfair to force people to work longer, especially when they may be in less physically able to do so.  It was also felt that the government should be looking at other ways to save money, such as reducing the number of MPs and the amount of money they are paid.  The group felt that it would be better to allow people to work longer if they wish to, but not to force them to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We do not believe that the retirement age should be raised to 68. We believe that this will have a detrimental effect on the 50+ population of this country. We are convinced that there are other ways to save money in the general spending of the treasury. For example, reduce salary of MP's and those in the House of Lords to a more normal and socially acceptable level, and reducing expense limits available to politicians. We believe that it is not fair to make this group of society work for 2 more years, when they are going to need to spend more time looking after themselves. People in this age bracket are also going to be less able bodied and thus may not be able to complete some types of work as well, and they will need to have more time for sick leave due to potential health conditions which are more common to acquire with old age, which will ultimately cost companies more money.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should not raise the retirement age to 68.  The majority of people in the 50+ age group are fit and able to work and will be willing to work later in life, however there will be a minority who are not fit enough to work or who do not wish to work later in life.  We believe that this group of people should not be forced to work and should be able to retire at the age of 66.  This will also save the government money on healthcare costs for this group of people.  The government should look at other ways to save money, for example by reducing the salaries of MP's and those in the House of Lords to a more normal and socially acceptable level, and reducing expense limits available to politicians.
