# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although the majority of dog owners are responsible and do clean up after their dogs, there are some who do not.  We feel that the government should not have to make it compulsory for dog owners to carry a doggy bag.  All responsible dog owners already do this, and it would be a waste of time and resources to police it.  However, there should be a campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of dog mess, and the importance of picking up after your dog.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People who have dogs need to take responsibility for any mess they may make in public spaces. Dog poo carries diseases which can be dangerous to other wildlife and humans. It takes a dog owner 2 seconds to pick up the mess were as it can take a member of the public a lot longer to deal with the smell and mess on there shoes. It is nasty seeing lots of dog poo on the pavement and dog owners should be ashamed of themselves for leaving the mess behind for others to deal with. In 5 years of dog ownership I have never gone out of the house with my dog without carrying a poo bag, it is just automatic to do so. Unfortunately some dog owners arent as responsible as others, and enforcing those to carry bags won't change their behaviour. It would be an excellent idea but I don't see how it could be enforced. Dog mess is a huge problem and apart from being very unpleasant to find, the faeces can carry diseases which children may pick up. Responsible owners will always clean up after their dog but irresponsible ones do not and I doubt that making sch a thing compulsory would change their behaviour.  Who would police it? There are not enough peope to go around after every
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of dog owners carrying a doggy bag, but felt that it was an individual's responsibility and that it should not be made compulsory.  The group felt that it was important to encourage people to be responsible dog owners, and that this could be done by campaigns in the media and by local authorities.  The group felt that the problem of irresponsible dog owners leaving their dog's mess in public places was a small one, and that it would be difficult to enforce a law making it compulsory to carry a doggy bag.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although it is not practical to enforce dog owners to carry doggy bags, it is important to encourage all dog owners to be responsible and pick up after their dog. Dog mess is unpleasant, it can carry diseases and it is dangerous to children. We feel that the government should provide more doggy bag dispensers in public places, to make it easier for dog owners to be responsible. We also feel that there should be a campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of dog mess, and the importance of picking it up.
