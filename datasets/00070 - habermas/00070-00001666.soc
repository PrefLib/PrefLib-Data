# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers. We believe that the wealthiest taxpayers should be paying their fair share of taxes and should not be receiving tax breaks. We believe that lowering taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers would increase the income gap between the highest and lowest earners. We believe that there is already a significant income gap between the highest and lowest earners and lowering taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers would increase this gap. We believe that reducing taxes would reduce the amount of money available for public spending at a time when it is crucial that money is made available for public services, especially the health services and education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We do not think taxes on the wealthiest should be lowered, however, we also do not think that wealthier people should be made to pay more in tax just because they earn more. Tax should be paid in accordance to earnings so as to level out wealth and reduce poverty. Having more taxes coming from wealthy earners could boost the spending on vital services that the poorer taxpayers are unable to fund.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should not lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers. The wealthiest taxpayers should not be made to pay higher taxes but they should not be given lower taxes either. Taxes should be paid in accordance to earnings.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “No, we shouldn't lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers, but we should lower taxes on the lowest earning taxpayers.”
