# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Learning a second language is important for children as it can open up a wide range of opportunities in the future, and also improve their development and social skills. This is especially important in the modern world, where the workplace is becoming increasingly multicultural, and being able to communicate with people from other countries is an important skill. However, we believe that forcing children to learn a second language is not the best way to go about this. Children should be given the choice of what language they want to learn, and if they don't want to learn a second language, they should not be forced to. This will help to foster a love of learning, and ensure that children are more likely to continue with their second language in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that all children should learn a second language. This is because it is likely to help them to develop cognitively and intellectually. We know that learning a second language can improve general intelligence. In addition, learning a second language at an early age has been shown to improve creative and critical thinking skills. It is also true that speaking a second language can increase job prospects and lead to better-paid jobs. Being able to speak a second language is also important in an increasingly multicultural society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should be encouraged to learn a second language, as this will help them in their futures, by opening up more opportunities for them and allowing them to communicate with a wider range of people. However, it should not be forced upon them, as this may lead to resentment and a dislike of the language.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We feel that children should have the right to choose if they would like to learn a second language. The benefits of being able to speak a second language are extensive, however we don't feel that it is correct to force children to learn a language they do not wish to learn.
