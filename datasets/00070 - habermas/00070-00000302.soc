# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although music lessons have a range of benefits for children and their families, there are more important things that the government could subsidise. Music lessons are a luxury that families can choose to get their children involved in if they wish to, rather than a necessity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We don't believe that it is an essential activity for the government to subsidise music lessons. The government already has a number of priorities that it needs to deal with and it seems as though music lessons are a luxury rather than an essential.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Music lessons are something that are beneficial for children, in allowing them to creatively express themselves and giving them an opportunity to learn a skill they might not normally get the chance to, but they don't seem like the best use of government money. The country is in crisis and there are many more important things that should be given priority over music lessons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, the government should not subsidise music lessons for low income families. Although it would be a great opportunity for children from low income families to get a chance to take up music lessons, we don't think that it should be funded by the government as we believe that there are other important things in this country that are in a much greater need of being funded and subsidised.
