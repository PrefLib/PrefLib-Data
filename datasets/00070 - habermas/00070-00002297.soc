# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of giving priority admission to disadvantaged groups. The group felt that this would be unfair to other students who were not disadvantaged, and that it would not be in the best interests of the disadvantaged students themselves. The group felt that if a student was disadvantaged, but still academically capable of attending university, then they should be given the opportunity to attend university, but that this should not be at the expense of other students. The group felt that it would be more beneficial for the disadvantaged student to attend a university that they were academically capable of attending, rather than being fast tracked into a university that they may not be able to keep up with.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although we feel that the term disadvantaged is very broad, we feel that for people who have been placed at a disadvantage due to socio-economic status or other similar factors, they should be given some form of preference when it comes to university admission. This would help to even the playing field a little and help those who may not have had the same opportunities as others. For people who have physical or mental disabilities, we feel that the issue is more complex. If the person is able to complete the course and is academically capable then they should be allowed entry, but if they need special provisions then the university should be able to provide them. For people who have experienced extreme trauma or have been diagnosed with a mental illness, we feel that it is unfair to ask that they be given special treatment as this would be unfair to other applicants. There are many forms of disadvantage and it would be difficult to cater to all of them. Therefore, we feel that for people who are disadvantaged due to socio-economic status or similar factors, they should be given some form of preference when it comes to university admission.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of giving disadvantaged groups admission priority to universities. The idea that some people should be fast tracked to a university education just because of their socio-economic status or their ethnicity was generally viewed as unfair. It was also felt that giving disadvantaged groups admission priority would not address the root of the problem, which is poverty and racism in society. The group felt that this would just be a band-aid solution that would not solve anything in the long run. However, the group also felt that there were certain circumstances where disadvantaged groups should be given admission priority. The group felt that if a disadvantaged person had the academic ability to be admitted to a university and was otherwise qualified, then they should be given admission priority. This would be the case for people who had a disability, who were refugees, or who were orphans. The group also felt that if a disadvantaged person had the academic ability to be admitted to a university but could not afford it, then they should be given financial assistance. This would be the case for people who were living in poverty or who were refugees. The group felt that these were the only circumstances in which disadvantaged groups should be given admission priority.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of giving priority admission to disadvantaged groups. The group felt that this would be unfair to other students who were not disadvantaged, and that it would not be in the best interests of the disadvantaged students themselves. The group felt that if a student was disadvantaged, but still academically capable of attending university, then they should be given the opportunity to attend university, but that this should not be at the expense of other students. The group felt that it would be more beneficial for the disadvantaged student to attend a university that they were academically capable of attending, rather than being fast tracked into a university that they may not be able to keep up with. The group also felt that it was important for universities to provide more support services for disadvantaged students to ensure that they were able to keep up and succeed in their studies.
