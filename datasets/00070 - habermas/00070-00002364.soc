# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the government funding a high-speed rail line from London to Birmingham. The group believed that it would be beneficial for the people of England, and would be a good way to improve infrastructure in the country. However, the group also believed that the government should not fund the project if it meant that other, more important, areas of public spending would have to be cut. The group believed that the NHS was a higher priority than the rail line, and so should not be cut to fund the project. The group also believed that the rail line should be built in a way that meant that it would be cost-effective to run, and so that it would not be a burden on the taxpayer. The group also believed that the environmental benefits of the rail line should be taken into account, and that this should be considered when deciding whether or not to fund the project.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of the government funding a high-speed rail line from London to Birmingham. This is because it will benefit the many commuters in the area and allow for more people to travel by train instead of by car. This is more environmentally friendly and will also help reduce congestion on the roads. However, the group was also in favour of making the rail line affordable to use. This means that the government must make sure that the costs of running the rail line are low enough for the ticket prices to be lower than the cost of driving. The group was also in favour of the government funding other rail lines in the future, but only if they are affordable to use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the decision that we think that the government should fund a high-speed rail line from London to Birmingham. This is because it would provide a much more efficient way of travelling between the two cities, and would be much more environmentally friendly. It would also cut down on the amount of cars on the roads, which would be beneficial for everyone. However, we do think that this would be very costly, and that this money could be spent on more important things. We think that if the government does decide to fund this rail line, it should be very careful with how it does this, so that it is as cost-effective as possible.
