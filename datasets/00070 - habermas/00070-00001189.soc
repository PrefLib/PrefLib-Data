# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although the imperial system of measurement has been used for centuries, and some people prefer to talk in feet, pounds, gallons and miles, I think that we should move to the metric system.  The metric system fits well with science, and will be a lot easier to use, because the measurements are compatible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the imperial system of measurement is outdated and should be replaced by the metric system. However, the imperial system is so deeply ingrained in our culture that it would be very difficult to change and would cause a lot of problems. Therefore, the best solution would be to keep the imperial system for things like clothing sizes, cooking measurements and everyday weights and distances, but to use the metric system for scientific measurements.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “I think that the imperial system of measurement is outdated and does not fit in with the metric system that is used in most of the world.  The imperial system is also not compatible with the science that is taught in schools and this could cause confusion for children.  However, I think that the imperial system is a part of our heritage and that it would be difficult for some people to change to a new system.  I think that the imperial system should be phased out gradually over time and that the metric system should be used more and more in schools and in everyday life.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “I feel that we should stop using the imperial system of measurement, because although some people may be accustomed to it and it might be difficult for them to change over, it is becoming more and more anachronistic as time goes on and the use of metric measurements is becoming more and more common in everyday life.   Also, metric is the universal standard and it would be beneficial to be able to have one set of measurements and to not have to deal with conversions.  On the other hand, I can see the point of those who argue that we should keep the imperial system of measurement, since it has been used in Britain for such a long time, and people would be very resistant to changing.  I feel that if we were to stop using the imperial system of measurement, then it would be best to change over slowly, so that people have time to adjust, rather than to just stop using it one day, because if people did not have time to adjust, then there would be a lot of confusion and problems.”
