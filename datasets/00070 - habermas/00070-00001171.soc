# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that a small reward system could be implemented by the government to help improve recycling in the UK, and to encourage people to be more aware of their impact on the environment. However, we feel that this would need to be monitored closely to avoid it being abused and also to ensure that it is effective.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of some form of incentive to encourage recycling. This could be in the form of a tax rebate, or some form of payment. However, there were some concerns about the practicalities of this, such as the cost, and how to ensure that people were recycling properly. The group felt that this would be a good way to encourage people to recycle, but that it would not be a long term solution, and that it would be better to invest in other ways to encourage recycling, such as improving the infrastructure to make it easier to recycle.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of paying people to recycle. However, it was also agreed that this idea should be implemented in a way that does not allow people to abuse the system. The group also agreed that it would be a good idea to use the money saved from this idea to improve the recycling system in the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It was thought that the government should pay people to recycle, however, there should be more of an incentive for the recycling to be recycled correctly rather than be thrown away in the bin, such as discount vouchers for buying food or drinks which have recyclable products, or even a discount on council tax. This will help people recycle more correctly and in turn will increase the amount of people that recycle as they can see the benefit from it, which in turn will decrease the amount of waste that is created. Overall, it was thought that if people are being paid by the government to recycle correctly, it will increase the amount of people recycling, which in turn will decrease the amount of waste produced. However, this will take a long time to come into effect, as people are so set in their ways and aren't likely to change what they do easily. This is why it was thought that an incentive such as the above should be used to encourage more people to recycle.
