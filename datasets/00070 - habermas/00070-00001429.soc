# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the participants believe that the government should have a role in reducing childhood obesity. Most people think that the government should focus on providing information and education on diet and exercise, and that this should be started at an early age. Some participants think that the government should also have a role in directly intervening in the diets of children, such as by providing a healthy school lunch or making it more expensive for parents to provide unhealthy food to their children. In general, most participants thought that parents had the primary responsibility for reducing childhood obesity. However, some participants also thought that the government should intervene when parents are unable or unwilling to provide a healthy diet for their children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the government taking steps to reduce childhood obesity, but felt that this was a complex issue and that there was no 'one size fits all' solution. The group felt that the government should provide information and support to parents and children, but that the onus should be on the parents to ensure that their children are eating a healthy diet and getting enough exercise. The group felt that the government should also ensure that school meals are healthy and nutritious, and that children are educated about the importance of a healthy diet and exercise. The group also felt that the government should take steps to ensure that healthy food is affordable for all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should reduce childhood obesity by ensuring children eat healthy food and take part in exercise. The government should also support parents to do the same. The government should educate children about the effects of obesity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should not be responsible for reducing childhood obesity, but they should be responsible for providing the facts, and for providing funding for local initiatives to reduce childhood obesity.
