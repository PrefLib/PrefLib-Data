# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of medical marijuana, with one person being slightly against the idea. The general feeling was that medical marijuana is good as it has helped people in the past, and the use of medical marijuana can be controlled and monitored so that people do not abuse it. The participant who was against medical marijuana had her concerns, such as addiction,  but also came to a consensus view that medical marijuana should be used for specific purposes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, we believe that the question posed by the scenario is very much a valid one, and that medical marijuana is certainly an important topic. There are a wide range of views in our group with some strongly in favour of medical marijuana and others strongly opposed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that the Government should set up an inquiry to look at the pros and cons of the medical use of marijuana. Doctors should be able to prescribe marijuana for medical use. The marijuana should be produced and dispensed through licensed pharmacies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is appropriate for doctors to prescribe medical marijuana. Medical marijuana has proven benefits to alleviate pain and the potential to treat a range of illnesses and chronic diseases. There are numerous studies that have proven its safety, with minimal side effects and no risk of death. The addictive properties are low compared to many other drugs used in medicine.  Medical marijuana is often very cost effective compared to other medication, and as such could have a huge positive impact on the NHS and public health. It is only right that patients should have the right to choose this treatment option if they wish, and should not be denied this right. It is important that the public are educated on the use of medical marijuana and that it is monitored to ensure that it is used for its intended purpose, but we believe that the benefits of this outweigh the risks.  This project was designed to elicit consensus from participants in a group environment, and allow them to explore their personal and collective opinions on a question in a safe space, while creating a meaningful and tangible output.
