# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, a high rate of inequality is bad for society. A high rate of inequality leads to social disharmony, where certain segments of the population feel discriminated against and marginalised. It also results in inefficient distribution of wealth, where resources are concentrated in the hands of a select few instead of being distributed evenly across society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “No, a high rate of inequality isn’t bad for society, but it is morally wrong and should be tackled.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, a high rate of inequality is bad for society. It can lead to lawlessness, unfair advantage and a feeling of unfairness. However, it is important to note that inequality can exist for many reasons. For example, inequality between men and women can exist because women are often expected to stay at home and raise children, thus reducing their ability to work and earn money. Inequality between races can exist because of historical injustices. Inequality between the rich and the poor can exist because of differences in ability and drive. Therefore, it is important to understand the causes of inequality before making judgements on whether it is good or bad.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: A high rate of inequality is bad for society because it leads to a breakdown in trust and cohesion, which can result in civil unrest and other negative consequences for society.
