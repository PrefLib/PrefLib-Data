# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The environmental impact of another runway in the London area would be a concern, but at the same time, the UK economy relies heavily on London and its tourism and economic hubs. Also, as London is an important cultural centre, people from all over the world travel to it, meaning a new runway would have a positive effect on the UK. However, the construction of another runway would be a nuisance to local residents and those who fly from the London area, so maybe a better solution would be to reduce congestion at airports by running trains to a new, dedicated airport outside the London area.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We don't think it is a good idea to start work on another runway at an airport in the London area. This is because of the environmental impact that it would have. We think that the pollution would be a big issue, and it would be a problem for the local residents. We think that the noise would be a problem as well, and it would be a problem for those living nearby. We also think that it would be a problem for the wildlife in the area. We think that it would be a problem for the local economy as well, as the businesses in the area would be affected by the construction work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is not a good idea to start work on another runway at an airport in the London area. This is because, in this day and age, we need to be doing everything we can to try and reduce pollution. An extra runway would inevitably increase the number of flights coming into and out of London, thus increasing the number of planes in the sky and therefore the amount of pollution in the air. If we are serious about reducing the effects of climate change, then we cannot continue to build things that increase the amount of pollution, even if it is something that may have short-term benefits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of a new runway at an airport in the London area, as it would increase the number of planes that could use the airport and therefore reduce the cost of flights. However, the group was also concerned about the impact that this would have on the environment, as the number of planes would increase the amount of pollution in the area. The group suggested that the government should consider building a new runway in a different area of London, so that the impact on the environment would be reduced.
