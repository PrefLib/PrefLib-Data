# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We would suggest that it would improve the NHS, but not necessarily in the ways that people would think.   We would expect to see drug prices to fall significantly as profit would not be a factor.  However, this would also mean that research and development would also take a massive hit as there would be no monetary incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to keep up with the newest, best and most effective treatments.   This is why we would suggest that the pharma industry should remain privately owned, but with a greater degree of oversight to reduce prices, and provide a better financial framework for pharmaceutical companies to provide the best for the patients they are responsible for.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the idea of a nationalised pharmaceutical industry is a good one.  It would reduce the cost of medicines and ensure that the NHS is able to provide medicines to all who need them.  However, there are many issues that would need to be considered, such as the impact on innovation and the ability to keep up with the demand for medicines.  The government would also need to ensure that there is enough competition in the market to keep prices down and to ensure that there is no abuse of power.  This would be difficult to achieve and would require careful planning and management.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: A nationalised pharmaceutical industry would be a great idea. The NHS would be able to get better deals on the medicines it purchases and this would allow it to invest in more frontline staff and services. The NHS would also be able to have a say in the research that was carried out and this would allow it to focus on the areas that it felt were most important.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although there are a number of potential problems and we need to be careful, we believe that a nationalised pharmaceutical industry could improve the NHS in the UK.
