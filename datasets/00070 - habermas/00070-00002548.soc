# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I'm a little in two minds about this topic. Part of me feels like the arts is a fundamental part of society that allows for free expression and communication that otherwise would be lost. If a new generation of children weren't exposed to the arts the way other generations were, we might lose a part of humanity that is a great deal of what we are as human beings. Then on the other side of things, in the current state of the world, the funding might be best spent elsewhere.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes they should be funded as they are a big part of what makes the UK appealing.  We do not have a lot of attractive things so we can draw on our rich artistic heritage to attract tourism and also promote happiness of the general population.  It will help build open and creative minds which will make as a better society overall.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The question of government funding the arts is a complex one, with valid arguments on both sides. I will argue that it promotes cultural enrichment and economic growth, while on the other hand I can say it stresses the limited resources and the importance of prioritizing other sectors. It is important to strike a balance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I don't believe the arts should be funded by the government, I feel that in a sucessfull and prosperous state, people would be willing to pay to access arts, such as theatre and galleries. If the money is not being spent by citizens, people perhaps do not have the money to be spending on such frivolities. Money from the government could be spent better else where to improve the economy. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Arts are an important part of opening minds to new possibilities, without which we would stagnate. Funding is important, but not as important as say healthcare or infrastructure.
