# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should make it easier for people to switch to other energy suppliers. This would help to reduce the cost of living crisis that many people are facing. It would also create a healthy competition between energy suppliers, which would help to keep energy prices low.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group came to the consensus view that the government should make it easier for people to switch energy suppliers. They believe that this will encourage energy suppliers to improve the service they offer, so that customers are happy with the service they receive. This will also lead to a healthy competition between the suppliers, as customers will choose the supplier that is giving them the best deal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should make it easier for people to switch to other energy suppliers. This is because the companies entice new customers with discounts and people should be able to take advantage of that without having to pay an extra charge. It would help during the cost of living crisis and would help customers see the money they could save by switching. This would also encourage a healthy competition between the energy companies and make sure that they keep their prices low to keep their customers happy. The government should also make it easier for the elderly to understand how to change their supplier as they often find it difficult to keep on top of what they are being charged and how much they are being charged for their energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the government should make it easier for people to switch to other energy suppliers. The current system is very complicated and people find it difficult to switch. If it was easier, it would be beneficial for both customers and energy suppliers. Customers would be able to find the best deals for them and energy suppliers would have to keep their prices competitive to attract new customers. This would be fairer for customers and would create an environment where suppliers have to keep their prices competitively low, rather than being able to hike up costs knowing that their customers cannot easily switch to an alternative supplier.
