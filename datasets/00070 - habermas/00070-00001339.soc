# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the consensus that the UK should not adopt a universal basic income system. We came to this conclusion by first acknowledging that it could be beneficial in some ways such as encouraging people to spend money into the UK high street but this would also lead to inflation and some people may feel even worse off due to this. We also concluded that this would disincentivise people to work as they would have a guaranteed income from the government even if they do not go out to work. Although we do believe it would be beneficial in some ways, there are other ways the government could improve life in the UK. We believe that the government should improve and make the public transport more reliable and easier to access. They should also improve their efforts to reduce carbon emissions to help save the environment. Although these improvements would be beneficial, we believe that the costs of the universal basic income system outweighs these benefits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While Universal Basic Income may seem a good idea at first glance, further research would be needed to see how this could be funded and what impact it would have on the economy. We believe that we could do a lot better as a country if we used the funds that are currently used for the welfare system and public services to support a better education system, which in turn would help more people get good jobs, thus helping the economy. If people are better educated then the economy will be stronger and in turn we can raise taxes, this would allow us to provide a better universal basic income to those who are not able to work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - A universal basic income system would be a good idea for the UK, however, it would need to be introduced in stages, so that people are not disincentivised from working. The system would need to be funded by a tax on businesses, so that it would not be funded by the taxpayer. This would also help to ensure that businesses do not replace workers with robots and AI, as the cost of this would be higher. This would also help to reduce the cost of living, as businesses would have to pay their workers a higher wage, in order to compete with the universal basic income. This would also help to reduce the number of people on benefits, as they would be able to find work that pays them more than the benefits they are receiving. This would also help to reduce the cost of living, as the cost of goods would be lower, as businesses would not be able to take advantage of people who are unemployed and desperate for work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - A universal basic income system would be a great idea for the UK. This is because it would help people who are out of work and help to reduce poverty in the UK. However, it is important to note that it would also help to reduce the incentive to work and could also lead to inflation as people would have more money to spend.
