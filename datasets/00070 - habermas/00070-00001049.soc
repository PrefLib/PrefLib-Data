# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although we don't agree with a total ban on advertising to children under the age of 18, we feel that some adverts should be banned. We think that adverts that contain explicit sexual content or adverts for alcohol or gambling should be banned for children under the age of 18. However, we think that it is important for children to be exposed to advertising, as it helps them develop their critical thinking skills. However, we don't think that the right and needs of the business should take precedence over those of children, even when the adverts in question are not of the explicit sort.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although we don't agree with a total ban on advertising to children under the age of 18, we feel that some adverts should be banned. We think that adverts that contain explicit sexual content or adverts for alcohol or gambling should be banned for children under the age of 18. However, we think that it is important for children to be exposed to advertising, as it helps them develop their critical thinking skills. However, we don't think that the right and needs of the children should be sacrificed for the businesses. Although, we do admit that businesses will always have their part in these issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although we don't agree with a total ban on advertising to children under the age of 18, we feel that some adverts should be banned. We think that adverts that contain explicit sexual content or adverts for alcohol or gambling should be banned for children under the age of 18. We think that it is important for children to be exposed to advertising, as it helps them develop their critical thinking skills. We also understand that advertising is important for businesses, but we feel that our children's welfare is paramount.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children should be exposed to advertising as it helps them develop their critical thinking skills. However, we feel that some adverts should be banned. We think that adverts that contain explicit sexual content or adverts for alcohol or gambling should be banned for children under the age of 18. This is because these kinds of adverts may encourage them to get involved in these activities. We do not agree with a total ban on advertising to children under the age of 18, because we think that it is important for children to be exposed to advertising, as it helps them develop their critical thinking skills and it is also important for businesses. Conclusion: We believe that the consensus statement obtained is a good representation of the opinions of the group of participants. We think that there is a good balance between the importance of the welfare of children and the importance of advertising for businesses. The consensus statement is also in line with our original opinion that there should be a ban on some advertising for children under the age of 18, but not a total ban.
