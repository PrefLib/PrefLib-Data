# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the wearing of face coverings in enclosed spaces should not be made compulsory, however in places where vulnerable people are present such as hospitals and care homes, the wearing of face coverings should be actively encouraged.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we should not make the wearing of face coverings compulsory in all enclosed spaces. There is a lack of evidence to support that this would be effective in preventing the spread of disease. The wearing of face coverings should be an individual choice, not legislated for. There is a possibility that the wearing of face coverings could lead to a false sense of security and therefore people may be less likely to follow other guidelines such as social distancing and hand hygiene. This could lead to an increase in the spread of disease.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that there is insufficient evidence to mandate that masks should be worn in all enclosed spaces. We do not feel that there is enough proof that masks are beneficial in preventing the spread of diseases. The wearing of masks should be a personal choice, not one that is forced upon people. There is a point where the government can have too much control over the population and this could be one such example. If someone wants to wear a mask, then they should feel free to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We do not think we should make the wearing of face coverings compulsory in all enclosed spaces. The wearing of masks in enclosed spaces should be an individual choice. There is no conclusive evidence that wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces actually reduce the spread of Covid-19, and some studies have shown that it can actually increase the spread of the virus, and lead to poorer hygiene habits. There is also the factor that many people are exempt from wearing masks, or that wearing them causes them harm. These people should not be denied entry to enclosed spaces because they cannot wear masks. That being said, we encourage the wearing of face coverings in enclosed spaces where vulnerable people are present.
