# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children over the age of 14 should have a legally binding voice in custody cases when parents divorce. The age of 14 was chosen because this is the age at which a child is able to consent to sexual intercourse. Therefore, it is also the age at which a child should be able to consent to who they live with.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the participants were in favour of children over 14 having a legally binding voice in custody cases when parents divorce. This is because at this age, children are old enough to have a mature opinion and should be allowed to express their views and feelings on the situation. However, this age should be set by the court. It should also be noted that if a child makes a poor decision, for example choosing the abusive parent to live with, the child could be removed from the situation and go into foster care.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children over the age of 14 should have a legally binding voice in custody cases when parents divorce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children over the age of 14 should have a legally binding voice in custody cases when parents divorce. They should be allowed to express their opinions and have them taken seriously in a court of law. The child should have some say in the matter as it is very important that their opinion is made clear. A marriage is between the two individuals I understand the child is also being affected but the vows were between the couple and it is their duty to weigh up the circumstances not a childs. The age is appropriate and it should be higher. Children are often used as pawns in divorce and their best interests are often forgotten about. I believe they should be able to express their opinions and have them taken seriously in a court of law. I don't know whether they should if I am honest. I think they should get a voice, but I don't know whether it should be legally binding. 14 is a young age and they could be influenced by other people. They would also be quite affected by the divorce, so might not have a Clear head or be thinking straight.
