# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the tax-free allowance is too low. We believe that people, especially those on low incomes, should be able to keep more of what they earn. We believe that having more disposable income would lead to better growth in the economy as long as inflation is kept under control. We believe that there needs to be more pressure on companies and billionaires to pay tax, as opposed to individuals who are already struggling. We believe that the current system is unfair and needs to be changed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the tax-free allowance is too low, and with the current cost of living, should be raised. This would be particularly beneficial to those on lower incomes who are struggling to live on the current allowance. However, the consensus opinion of the group is that there is also a need to look at the tax system as a whole, as it needs a serious shake-up. Many of us feel that the tax-free allowance is used to subsidise the tax cuts on big businesses, and that there is a need to look at the whole system and bring in a more progressive system that taxes the rich proportionately more. We also think that more needs to be done to encourage the big companies and the super-rich to pay their taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “No, the tax-free allowance is not too low, as the money from taxes goes towards helping the poor and vulnerable in society.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be more tax on big businesses and the tax-free allowance should be higher.
