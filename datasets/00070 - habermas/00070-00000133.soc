# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government has a role to play in supporting unemployed people. This may be in providing support to individuals, such as support with barriers to employment. This support could include support with housing, addiction, health, family commitments, transportation and childcare. The support may also need to be provided to the organisations who are helping the individuals. It may also be about providing support to the organisations themselves. This may include providing the organisations with funds to support individuals and for the training of staff to support individuals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There is a role for the government to support the unemployed, but also to support organisations and businesses in being able to provide work and training to the unemployed. In order to help the unemployed, there must be consideration about other barriers they may face, such as poor housing, addiction, poor physical or mental health, family commitments, transportation issues, child care needs.  These factors may need to be addressed before any job seeking can occur. Some form of support is needed to help with these. It is difficult to provide a general consensus statement that covers all cases, but this general statement would be accepted by the group as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the government should do more to help the unemployed. The way in which people can be helped can be very broad and be tailored to each individual. In order to help the unemployed, there must be consideration about other barriers they may face, such as poor housing, addiction, poor physical or mental health, family commitments, transportation issues, child care needs.  These factors may need to be addressed before any job seeking can occur. Some form of support is needed to help with these. There is a role for the government to support businesses and organisations in being able to provide work and training to the unemployed. Support can be given to individuals, but also to organisations to help them support individuals. Conclusion I believe that this experience of using the Delphi technique has been very useful. Although the whole process took a long time, with many iterations of revisions and feedback, I found that the end result was of a very high quality, with all views of the participants being taken into account.  Although the level of involvement and number of participants was not as high as I had hoped, the views of those involved were very valuable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government has a responsibility to ensure that its citizens are supported in a way that ensures that they can achieve their full potential. This includes support for individuals, and also support for businesses and organisations to be able to offer work, training, and development to the unemployed. The support offered to individuals needs to be tailored to each individual, as some barriers to employment need to be addressed first, such as housing, addiction, poor physical or mental health, family commitments, transportation issues, child care needs.  This is because without addressing these barriers, the likelihood of a person being able to be successful in finding a job is greatly reduced. Some form of support is needed to help with these, such as more mental health services, better transport links, better housing, and the use of job coaches to help unemployed individuals to get the support they need to become ready for work. Support can be given to individuals, but also to organisations to help them support individuals. Support for organisations can take the form of tax incentives, grants, subsidies, or other forms of financial assistance, or it can be in the form of assistance to find training programmes and funding for training programmes for people who may have been overlooked in the hiring process.
