# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not build a nuclear power station on each of the islands of the UK. Nuclear energy is an important part of the energy mix in the UK, and the government has a target of generating 30% of the UK's electricity from nuclear by 2030. However, there are several reasons why building a nuclear power station on every island would not be a good idea. Firstly, it would be impractical and too expensive to build a power station on every island in the UK, and the expense of doing so would make it not financially viable. Secondly, even though the UK is an island itself, most of the population and energy use is concentrated in a few large cities, which means that a nuclear power station on the mainland would be much more efficient than one on one of the islands. Finally, many of the islands are too small to have the space required for a power station, and the environmental impact on the local population would be too great to justify building one. The group also considered that there are better options than nuclear power generation. It is important that the UK looks to renewable energy for future power generation, as well as new, more efficient energy technologies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: We should not build a nuclear power station on each of the islands of the UK. While nuclear energy may be one of the most environmentally friendly forms of energy generation, there are several reasons why building a nuclear power station on every island would not be a good idea. Firstly, the islands of the UK have a relatively small population, which means that it would not make financial sense to invest in energy production there. Secondly, building such a large station would harm the local environment, and because many of the islands are very small, this would have a large impact on the community. Finally, many of the islands in the UK are going to be vulnerable as climate change leads to rising sea levels and extreme weather events, so it is important to site nuclear power stations in locations that will be safe for a long time. For these reasons, we do not think it is a good idea to build a power station on every island. Instead, we think it is important for the UK to look to renewable energy as a new source of power for the country, as well as continuing to innovate and develop new energy technology.

Conclusion: The benefits of using a group consensus statement are that the opinions of each individual are heard by all and considered by all.  This means that the group can consider the opinions and arguments of each participant and reach the best possible consensus,
