# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should be taught about the human body and the changes it goes through as they grow older. They should also be taught about appropriate touching and about consent. However, the group was not in favour of teaching children about sex before the age of 12. The group felt that sex education should be tailored to the age of the child.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Schools should have age appropriate sex education programmes. This can help prevent any confusion for children, and also helps to reduce the risk of teen pregnancies. There is a lot of sexual content on the internet, and without appropriate sex education, it could leave children confused and may lead to risky behaviours.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, we believe that every school should have an age-appropriate sex education program. Sex education is important for children to be informed about, and understand how their bodies work and how they can deal with different situations. It also ensures they are well educated about the dangers of unprotected sex, and know how to stay safe. They can also be taught about consent, and understanding other people's feelings. We feel that it is important to include sex education in schools as there may be children who have no other way to find out information on this topic, and so they may learn bad information from the internet and friends. The topics covered should be age appropriate, so for younger children it would be limited, and for older children they could be taught about STI's and consent.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Sex education should be age appropriate. The subject is very important and can prevent a lot of harm to children. In the past, this subject was taboo and rarely spoken about. The world is a very different place now and sex is much more openly discussed. Therefore, it is important that children are educated on the subject. However, it is important that this education is tailored to the age of the child. Young children should be taught about the changes that will happen to their bodies and how to keep themselves safe. Older children should be taught about sex and relationships in more detail. It is also important that children are taught about consent and that they are able to say no to unwanted sexual advances.
