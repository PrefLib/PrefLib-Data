# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The government should subsidize childcare, because it is important for the future of society to have parents working and children being cared for in a good environment.  There are numerous reasons as to why a parent may struggle with the costs of bringing up a child, and no matter what these reasons are, the child should not be punished for it.  Government aid towards future generations is crucial to the healthy future of the planet as a whole.  Subsidising childcare is a good step towards achieving that.”

If the government does not subsidize childcare, it might become a case of some families not having parents at work because they cannot put their children into childcare.  The government should help those especially that are in a dire financial situation and who have children to take care of.
