# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The use of private jets should be discouraged as it is contributing to pollution, however, their use is necessary in some cases and there is a need to be able to transport people quickly in emergency situations. Therefore, a ban is not appropriate but a limit to the use of private jets is needed. Limits may be enforced by reducing the speed that private jets are able to travel in order to limit the emission of greenhouse gases and by developing more stringent no fly zones. In order to prevent the use of private jets becoming too heavy on the taxpayers of government-funded jurisdictions, wealth and inheritance taxes may be raised on private jet owners and new legislation may be implemented that it will be mandatory for all private jet owners to offset the emissions of their flights to the climate change mitigation of their choice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Private jets are contributing to pollution, but they are a necessary evil. Their high cost may limit their use, but their value in emergency situations cannot be ignored. The most important step that should be taken is to make sure they do not damage the environment with the launch of low emission aircraft.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Private jets should not be banned, but they should be used only when absolutely necessary. This may be done by making it more expensive to use a private jet, by increasing taxes on private jet owners, and by making it mandatory for private jet owners to offset the emissions of their flights.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the use of private jets should be discouraged as they are contributing to pollution. However, their use is necessary in some cases and there is a need to be able to transport people quickly in emergency situations. Therefore, a ban is not appropriate, but there is a need to limit the use of private jets to only when necessary. This may be done by making it more expensive to use a private jet, by increasing taxes on private jet owners, and by making it mandatory for private jet owners to offset the emissions of their flights.
