# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that people should be allowed to express their free speech and should not be supressed by companies or organisations. Companies should not be able to use 'intellectual property' laws to supress free speech. This is undemocratic and can lead to more inequality in society. We also believe that people should be mindful of not breaking any copyright laws while expressing their free speech.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Companies should not have the power to suppress free speech. This is undemocratic and could lead to even more inequality in society where people with money have the power to suppress or propagate their own viewpoint. Ecocnomic institutions already have too much power to influence society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Participants have a right to free speech and we support a fairer society where everyone can speak freely regardless of what their opinion may be even if its something that most people would find repellent. We do not support any company or organisation using intellectual property laws to supress free speech.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: While free speech is important, it is essential that there are clear laws around intellectual property to protect companies, and people. It is not fair that a company can invest in a new product or invention, and then have someone else copy it without consequence. This will lead to less incentive for people to be creative and come up with new things. However, people should still be able to freely express their views, as long as they don't violate someone else's property rights.
