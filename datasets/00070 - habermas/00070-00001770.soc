# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should be encouraged to ride bikes as it is a fun and healthy activity. A legal minimum age of buying a bike is unnecessary and would be difficult to enforce. The group was then asked to come up with a consensus view on the following question:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should not be a legal minimum age limit for buying a bicycle. Children should be encouraged to exercise and putting an age limit on this would impede this. If children are supervised well then there will not be an issue. Learning to ride a bike as a child was an essential part of growing up as it teaches balance, independence, confidence and makes exercise fun! I think introducing a minimum legal age for buying a bicycle would negatively impact the hobby. I remember going to buy my first bike with my parents when I was little and being so excited to get the brand new frame without stabilisers and with black and purple sparkly tassels hanging from the handlebars. There should not be a legal minimum age of buying a bicycle. Pedal bikes and push bikes all allow children to develop their motor skills and challenge them to learn a difficult skill. Children also learn to bond and spend time with the caregiver that teaches them to ride a bike. There should only be a minimum age limit for buying a bicycle if it is electric in nature. In addition, there's not likely to be circumstance where a juvenile is able to have the funds available to make such a purchase.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should not be a legal minimum age limit for buying a bicycle, but there should be a minimum legal age limit for riding a bicycle on the road.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should not be a minimum legal age limit for buying a bicycle. Children learning to ride a bike, either with or without stabilisers, is an essential part of childhood and growing up. The age at which children learn to ride varies and should not be restricted by law. Children learn to balance, gain independence and have fun whilst riding their bikes. The activity is also a social experience which they share with parents, siblings and friends.
