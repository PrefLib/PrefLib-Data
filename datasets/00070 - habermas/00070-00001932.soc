# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Raising the taxes on alcohol and cigarettes is a very controversial topic. The main argument is that it will be better for public health, reducing consumption and decreasing the number of health problems related to smoking and alcohol consumption. It will also raise money for the NHS, which is suffering from budget cuts. The problem is that raising the taxes on alcohol and cigarettes will make them unaffordable for some, which could increase tax evasion and increase poverty. The effect on the pub trade is also a concern. If we raise taxes on alcohol, pubs may suffer and there may be an increase in crime and disorder. I think the positives outweigh the negatives. I think that the NHS should be funded by taxes, and the money for this should come from the people who have put themselves in harm's way and have caused health problems.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the conclusion that alcohol and cigarettes should not be taxed more highly. The current level of taxation on these products is high enough. Raising taxes would be unfair on those who like a drink and a smoke, and it could lead to tax evasion. People should have a choice as to what they spend their money on, and not be punished by making products too expensive. It could also lead to pubs suffering from a decrease in sales if people spend less money.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should raise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. This is because the NHS is underfunded and needs more money. Also, it is an unhealthy habit and we should discourage people from smoking and drinking. The government should also make it more expensive for young people to buy alcohol and cigarettes to discourage them from taking up the habit.
