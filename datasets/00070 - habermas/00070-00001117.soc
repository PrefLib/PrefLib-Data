# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the monarchy. They felt that it was a unique institution that brings with it a sense of national identity and continuity. They felt that the current system works well and should be maintained. They felt that it was an important part of the country's history and culture.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is better to have a monarchy than a republic.  It is a part of our heritage and brings with it continuity and stability.  Monarchs are often appointed for a long period of time, which brings with it consistency.  The monarchy also brings in tourism and all the associated monetary benefits.

The question of whether it is better to have a monarchy or republic is a vague one, and the answer depends on a lot of factors. A monarchy can provide stability and continuity, with a symbolic figurehead representing the nation. It may have been historical and cultural roots that instill a sense of national identity.

However, the monarchy is something that is very costly and we feel that it is something that could be done away with and the country would still be very successful.
