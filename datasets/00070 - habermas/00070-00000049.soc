# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should intervene to set rents as it can protect the vulnerable in society".
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group came to the consensus view that landlords should not be allowed to forcefully increase rents. They also stated that they should be allowed to increase rents in certain circumstances but those should be specified by law. They also noted that they don't think that the government should necessarily force landlords to lower rents, but should consider tax policies that might help address the housing crisis.  Conclusion:  The survey is interesting because it reflects the individual participants' thoughts on a certain issue and also shows how the process of reaching a consensus can sometimes be very difficult. The participants of the survey are very divided in their views, and some of the views are polar opposite. However, some of the participants were more open to the idea of a consensus and were able to formulate a statement that encompassed the majority of the views.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, the government should not be allowed to force landlords to lower rent. Instead, the government should incentivize new housing development by providing tax breaks and other economic incentives to encourage building new homes. This will alleviate the current housing shortage which will lower the costs of renting and buying a home.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the free market is the most efficient way to ensure resources are allocated in the best way possible. However, there are certain goods and services that are not allocated efficiently in this way. Landlords have an incentive to charge as much as they can to maximise profits, and this means that housing will become increasingly unaffordable. The government needs to step in and control rent prices, at least for the time being.
