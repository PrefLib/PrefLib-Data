# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I think that the UK has lots of resources and therefore we should be open to sharing with those less fortunate than ourselves. It is extremely brave and scary to be a refugee and I think people in the UK forget that - refugees aren't just coming to the UK for the fun of it. We should support and be more human.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We are vastly overpopulated as is and the economy is seriously struggling. We do not need any mor increases to populattion. Our culture is already being seriously eroded by disrespect and high expectations from incoming immigrants. Sadly they are resposible for some awful crimes. They ned to be brave enough to stay and stand up to their problems in their own countries instead of adding to ours. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes. As one of the riches countries in the world, I think we should be doing more to help refugees.  We are morally obliged to do so. I think the war in the Ukraine has shown that many people in the UK would be willing to help refugees.  I believe that refugees could bring a lot to our society, economically.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although the UK is indeed a wealthy country, this does not mean it should automatically host more refugees. We are densely populated as it is, and extra people only puts pressure on already stretched services. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - It's been shown that some refugees are using the option to come to the UK under false pretences e.g. men pretending to be younger than they are....I also feel that people should fight for change within their own countries, by taking on refugee status they will see no change in their home countries
