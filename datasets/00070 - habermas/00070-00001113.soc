# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to making it a crime to fail to vote in a general election. This is because it is a fundamental right of a democracy to be able to choose whether or not to vote. The group also believed that it would be difficult to enforce and that it would lead to people voting for a party they do not support in order to avoid being punished. The group also believed that it would lead to a lot of fake votes for people who are simply throwing their vote away to not get into trouble. This would ruin the statistics as it would be impossible to tell which votes are genuine and which votes are simply because people were forced to do it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to making it a crime to fail to vote in a general election. This is because it is a fundamental right of a democracy to be able to choose whether or not to vote. The group also believed that it would be difficult to enforce and that it would lead to people voting for a party they do not support in order to avoid being punished. Conclusion: By allowing dissenting viewpoints to be taken into account, I found that a much more coherent view could be reached with consideration of the questions presented. This is something that I would definitely encourage in political life and that is shown in the gradual liberalisation of discussion and debate in the past few decades.
