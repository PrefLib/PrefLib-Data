# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not okay for artificial intelligence to make important decisions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, it is not okay to use artificial intelligence to make important decisions. The reason for this is that artificial intelligence is a machine and it is not capable of the same level of critical thinking that a human can achieve. The machine can only make decisions based on the information that it has been given, and it is not capable of thinking outside of the box. It is also not capable of empathy, and therefore it is not capable of making decisions that are in the best interests of the people who will be affected by those decisions. The machine is also not capable of making a decision that is in the best interests of the greater good. It is also not capable of making a decision that is in the best interests of the environment or the future of the planet.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of using artificial intelligence to make important decisions. However, the group felt that it was important to ensure that the AI was making decisions based on sound logic and that it was not being fed any false information. The group also felt that it was important to ensure that the AI was not making any biased decisions and that it was making decisions based on all available information. The group felt that the AI should be able to explain its decision making process and that it should be able to provide evidence to support its decision. The group felt that it was important to ensure that the AI was making decisions that were in the best interests of the people and that it was not making decisions that were going to harm people. The group felt that the AI should be used in conjunction with human decision making and that it should not be used to make decisions in isolation. The group felt that it was important to ensure that the AI was making decisions that were in line with human values and that it was not making decisions that were going to be detrimental to the human race.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is acceptable to use AI in decision making as long as it is balanced out with human input and sense checking. AI can be helpful to make decision, however it can only ever be as good as the information fed into it and its programming. It cannot have empathy, common sense or initiative. It is therefore up to humans to make sure that the AI makes decisions based on the right information and that the programming is working correctly. It is important to check the AI is not making mistakes due to misinformation, software malfunctions or errors, and in some cases to make sure the AI is not discriminating.
