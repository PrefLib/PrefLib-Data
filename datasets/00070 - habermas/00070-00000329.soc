# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing the money spent on healthcare. They argued that the quality of healthcare is very good in the UK and it is not something that should be reduced. They acknowledged that it is already struggling under the current funding so it is in desperate need of more funding. They also suggested that the NHS should be restructured so that it becomes more efficient and uses money better so that the waiting times can be reduced and the NHS is made more user friendly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing the money spent on healthcare. They argued that the quality of healthcare is very good in the UK and it is not something that should be reduced. They acknowledged that it is already struggling under the current funding so it is in desperate need of more funding. They also suggested that the NHS should be restructured so that it becomes more efficient and uses money better so that the waiting times can be reduced and the NHS is made more user friendly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group in general did not want to reduce the amount of money spent on healthcare. The current level of funding is struggling to keep up with the demand. This has led to huge waiting times for people needing treatment. The NHS should be restructured to make it more efficient and use money in the best way. More funding is needed to be able to hire more doctors and nurses to help the existing staff. This will allow them to cope better and to shorten waiting times.
