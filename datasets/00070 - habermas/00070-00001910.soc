# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe the NHS is a world leading health care system, the personnel that work in it are hard working and under appreciated. However, they are not provided with good enough pay or resources to do even better. The staff are overworked and underpaid meaning they can't work to their full potential.  We believe that people's lives have been put at risk due to delays to non urgent surgeries and delayed diagnosis. The care people receive varies from place to place, sometimes you get an appointment within a few days, sometimes you have to wait months, it's a postcode lottery. We feel that in a time of crisis, people have put their differences aside and worked together to ensure that the country remains stable and safe. We believe that more can be done to help the NHS and their patients, but we believe the NHS and the people that work within it are doing as best of a job as they can.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The NHS is not doing a good job. They are trying their best but are severely underfunded. The staff are working very hard and are not getting the recognition they deserve.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The NHS is a wonderful service that is the envy of the world.  It is staffed by caring people who want to do their best for their patients.  The service is, however, underfunded and understaffed.  The staff are working under enormous pressure and this has led to many people having to wait for treatment and, in some cases, this has led to serious consequences for patients.  The pandemic has added to the pressure on the NHS and this has led to staff shortages, with many staff having to self-isolate, and this has led to longer waiting times for treatment.
