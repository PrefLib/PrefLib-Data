# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the government should do more to help the unemployed. The way in which people can be helped can be very broad and be tailored to each individual. In order to help the unemployed, there must be consideration about other barriers they may face, such as poor housing, addiction, poor physical or mental health, family commitments, transportation issues, child care needs.  These factors may need to be addressed before any job seeking can occur. Some form of support is needed to help with these. Also, there is a role for the government to support businesses and organisations in being able to provide work and training to the unemployed. Support can be given to individuals, but also to organisations to help them support individuals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should do more to help unemployed people find jobs, however, the government is not the only solution to unemployment. People should not be relying solely on the government to help them find work, but should look for opportunities themselves as well. Unemployment can be a really tough experience, and the government should provide more resources for people to learn new skills and access employment opportunities. If the government want to create more jobs in the community, they need to support local businesses as well as larger employers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should do more to help unemployed people find jobs. If there is less people out of work and more people in work, then it will be better for our economy and the NHS. The government should help unemployed people into paid work, it is their responsibility to provide a support framework for the citizens of the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should do more to help unemployed people find jobs. The jobs need to be of good quality, paying good wages and providing opportunities for people to grow and progress. There needs to be more government support for people to help them get the skills they need to move into employment.
