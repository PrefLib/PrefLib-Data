# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Parental rights should be limited when it comes to health matters concerning their children, especially as children grow older. Parents can become controlling in this area and this can be damaging for the parent/child relationship. Children should be allowed to have a level of privacy in their health, and this should be respected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the parents of the child have the right to know when their child has received contraception but there are some exceptions to this. For example, if the child is vulnerable or has special needs, the parent of the child has the right to know when their child has received contraception. If the child is below the age of 16, the parent of the child has the right to know when their child has received contraception. If the child is above the age of 16, it is down to the child to inform the parents when they have received contraception but it is also down to the child to decide if they want to inform their parents. In addition, if the child is above the age of 18, it is their right to privacy and confidentiality regardless of their parent's wishes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, parents should not have the right to know when their children have received contraception, as it is a private matter.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children should be able to keep information confidential as it can affect the child’s development and progress. The parent has the right to know but not necessarily the right to be informed. The parent should also be aware of the potential outcomes of children’s decision to have sex. The child needs to be aware of the options and the benefits and risks of the treatment.
