# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final consensus statement: While recognising the essential necessity for animal testing, the process should be heavily regulated and enforced to ensure that animals are treated with the respect they deserve. The process may be with an aim of mass production of a particular product in mind, which necessarily means mass suffering of the animals during testing. The testing process should however be regulated and ethical rules and parameters put in place that curtail such overbearing mass suffering of the animals without compromising the safety of the humans and the environment at large. The act of animal testing should not be completely banned especially for vital products like medicines and vaccines since it is scientifically proven that no other ways other than the animals could be used to do the testing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Animal testing is a very important and necessary part of medical advances and the testing of potentially hazardous substances. However the process should be heavily regulated to ensure that animals are treated with the respect they deserve. We should never introduce a blanket ban on animal testing as it is an important part of the production of products that have the potential to improve the health of humans and animals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Animal testing is an important part of medical development and we should not outright ban it. However we should make the process heavily regulated to ensure that animals are treated with the respect they deserve and that there are no other alternatives.
