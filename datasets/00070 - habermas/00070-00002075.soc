# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is a responsibility to protect the environment for the benefit of future generations. The environment is the only home that we have and we should try to tread as lightly as possible on this planet.  In return for its care of us, we should also reciprocate.  Measures should be taken to limit short-term profiteering so that our natural world has survives without disproportionate human impact.  Society has a responsibility to ensure that our behaviour does not do irreversible damage to the environment.  It is important that we preserve resources and look protect wildlife and nature.  Large levels of deforestation and rising climate are causing the environment to be more important than ever in order to protect the future generations and animals.  Housing developments are  destroying large parts of the environment.  Completely.  As a young person I would love to bring children into the world, however, many people of my generation are discussing whether it is selfish to have children as you are bringing them into a world destined for destruction.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, we were in agreement that we have a responsibility to protect the environment for the benefit of future generations.  The environment is the only home that we have and we should try to tread as lightly as possible on this planet.  In return for its care of us, we should also reciprocate.  Humans have played a large role in the global warming phenomenon which we must act on to limit.  This is a natural occurrence and a large ice melt off will take place whether or not humans play a significant role in it.  Large levels of deforestation and rising climate are causing the environment to be more important than ever in order to protect the future generations and animals.  Housing developments are  destroying large parts of the environment.  As we have already done significant damage to the environment for greed and profit, society has a responsibility to ensure that our behaviour does not do irreversible damage to the environment.  It is important that we preserve resources and look protect wildlife and nature.  Measures should be taken to limit short-term profiteering so that our natural world has survives without disproportionate human impact. Conclusion 1. Does the draft consensus statement represent the views of the participants accurately? 2.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There is general agreement that we have a responsibility to protect the environment for the benefit of future generations. The environment is the only home that we have and we should try to tread as lightly as possible on this planet.  In return for its care of us, we should also reciprocate.  We should continue to look into global warming to see if its definitely caused by humans or discover if this is a natural occurrence and would happen no matter what we do.  Large levels of deforestation and rising climate are causing the environment to be more important than ever in order to protect the future generations and animals.  Housing developments are  destroying large parts of the environment.  Society has a responsibility to ensure that our behaviour does not do irreversible damage to the environment.  It is important that we preserve resources and look protect wildlife and nature.  Measures should be taken to limit short-term profiteering so that our natural world has survives without disproportionate human impact.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Draft consensus statement (revised): In general, the group was in agreement that we have a responsibility to protect the environment for the benefit of future generations.  The environment is the only home that we have and we should try to tread as lightly as possible on this planet.  In return for its care of us, we should also reciprocate.  We should continue to look into global warming to see if its definitely caused by humans or discover if this is a natural occurrence and would happen no matter what we do.  Large levels of deforestation and rising climate are causing the environment to be more important than ever in order to protect the future generations and animals.
