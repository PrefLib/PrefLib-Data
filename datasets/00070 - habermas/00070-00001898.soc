# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should try to reduce the reliance of new internal combustion engines, and to reduce the emission of gases from these engines. This can be achieved by making electric vehicles more affordable and more accessible for ordinary people. We should also try to make it easier for used engines to be reused, repurposed and recycled to reduce the number of engines that end up in landfill.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we should not end the sale of all new internal combustion engines. We think that this is not a feasible option currently. Yes in developed countries it might be more workable to replace internal combustion engines with more environmentally friendly alternatives, but the technology for those alternatives might not be so widespread or cost effective in some developing parts of the world, making a blanket ban less workable on a larger scale. We think a better policy would be to have targets to reduce reliance of internal combustion engines and gradually bring the overall numbers down in the coming years as the replacement technology improves and becomes cheaper for mass adoption.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should end the sale of all new internal combustion engines as it is too harmful for the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, the sale of all new internal combustion engines should not be ended. We believe that internal combustion engines are still very much needed in the world today. They are needed to power machines that are essential for the world to function.
