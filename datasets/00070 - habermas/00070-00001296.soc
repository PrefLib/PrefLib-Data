# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should be given the opportunity to learn to play a musical instrument. If they show an interest then the parents should support them to learn the instrument and have lessons. Children who are taught an instrument will have better self-esteem and happiness. Children who are not interested in learning an instrument should be given the opportunity to learn another creative skill. Children who learn to play an instrument may play in the community or in school concerts. The participants had researched the question prior to their discussion and had studied the articles from the National Association of Music Merchants, USA, 13 Arguments Why All Children Should Learn to Play a Musical Instrument (2010) and Jerry Schwirch, Why Every Child Should Play a Musical Instrument (2010).
