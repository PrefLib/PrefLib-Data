# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, we should change our economic system from capitalism to socialism because we feel that it will improve equality and happiness across society. A second group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The world is divided on whether to use capitalism or socialism as an economic system. We think that it is important that the poorest are not forced to be in poverty and that the richest are not allowed to grow rich through greed. The problem is, how do you achieve this without punishing the people who work hard and make the economy function? Is there a middle ground between socialism and capitalism? It is a complex problem that will take time to figure out. We hope that there will be a system that is both fair to all people and also motivates hard working people to continue doing their jobs and to inspire others to do well in their careers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a shift from capitalism to socialism. Capitalism leads to inequality, which is not only unfair but also leads to poorer health and wellbeing. Socialism would lead to a more equal society, which would be better for everyone. The change would not be easy, however, as it would require a change in the way that people think. It would also require a change in the way that the economy is run, which would be very difficult.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Capitalism is an economic system that benefits the rich and therefore we should change to socialism.
