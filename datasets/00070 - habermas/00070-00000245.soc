# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Reducing meat consumption to once or twice a week has many benefits. Health-wise, eating less meat can reduce the risk of heart disease and many cancers. In addition, animal agriculture has a negative impact on the environment through greenhouse gas emissions and waste production. However, meat is also an important source of protein and should be consumed in moderation. The meat we do eat should be of the highest quality, with organic, grass-fed meat being the best option. In addition, we should make sure we use as much of the animal as possible to minimise waste.
