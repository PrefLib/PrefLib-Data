# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I think people from all backgrounds should be given the chance to enter university. Not everyone has the money to gain access and i think this is wrong and we are missing out on the opportunity to have more skilled members within out nations. It would help with staff shortages within certain industries. However, i do not think they should be given priority over others who are more academically deserving. I believe there are enough opportunities within study to advance if you wish to, and university isn't the best option for some people. Admission should be based on merit and merit alone. There is no reason for anyone to be given priority other than on merit.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of giving admission priority to disadvantaged groups. They felt that university admission should be based on merit and merit alone. They felt that this would be the best way to ensure that the best and brightest people get into university. They felt that disadvantaged groups should be given the same opportunities as everyone else and that they should not be given any special treatment. They felt that the idea of giving disadvantaged groups admission priority was patronising and insulting. They felt that it would be better to focus on helping disadvantaged groups once they had been admitted to university rather than giving them admission priority. They felt that it was important to ensure that all students had the same opportunities once they had been admitted to university.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, universities should not give admission priority to disadvantaged groups. There should be no preferential treatment based on any factor other than merit. This is the best way to ensure that the best and brightest are admitted to university. However, in some countries, there are groups that have been historically disadvantaged. In these countries, it may be necessary to give some priority to these groups in order to help them catch up to the rest of the population. This priority should be temporary though, and it should be ended as soon as possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “I believe that everyone should be given the chance to enter university, however I do not think that they should be given priority over other people who have worked hard to get there. I think that universities should be looking at the grades that people have achieved and their potential to achieve well in their chosen course and not their background. There are many people who have come from disadvantaged backgrounds and have worked hard to get the grades that they have achieved and I think that it is unfair to give people who have not worked as hard the same opportunity to attend university.”
