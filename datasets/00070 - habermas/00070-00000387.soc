# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the current voting system in the UK is considered to be fair and accessible. Most people are happy with the current system, and changing it could potentially lower public engagement in the voting process. While it is true that the current system favours larger parties, and there is potential for this to create an unfair political system, this can be controlled through public engagement. If more people vote for smaller parties that share their views, then this would force larger parties to consider their policies more carefully.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The current voting system in the UK is largely considered to be fair and accessible. However, there is a risk that smaller parties are excluded by the current voting system. This is a significant risk to the UK's democratic system, as a healthy democracy depends on the ability of a wide range of political views to be represented. The above statement was then critiqued by another group of participants. This is presented below.

Most people are happy with the current system, and changing it could potentially lower public engagement in the voting process. While it is true that the current system favours larger parties, and there is potential for this to create an unfair political system, this can be controlled through public engagement. If more people vote for smaller parties that share their views, then this would force larger parties to consider their policies more carefully. In summary, although it is true that the current system is not always entirely fair, it is also true that this is under the control of the public - who can make the system more fair through more active engagement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The current voting system in the UK is not fair or accessible, and although it favours larger parties, changing it could potentially lower public engagement in the voting process. Smaller parties should have a stronger presence in the media, and the public should be better educated about all of the options available to them. If these things are improved, then the political system would be forced to be more representative of the population, regardless of the voting system used.
