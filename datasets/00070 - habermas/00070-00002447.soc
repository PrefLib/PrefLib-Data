# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the public should not be forced to wear masks on buses. People have freedom and human rights that need to be respected in the UK. We can advise people on the benefits of mask wearing on buses, and how this protects other members of the public, but we can not force people to don a mask if they refuse. People have different varying beliefs and we need to respect their views even if it clashes with out own personal ones.  People may refuse to wear a mask because of... physical health problems, breathing and lung conditions, disability, mental health problems and cancer.

Wearing masks has been proven by research that they can reduce spread of airbourne diseases. However mask wearing has to continue to be individual choice because we do not know why someone refuses to don a mask. The reason for refusal can include physical health problems, breathing and lung conditions, disability, mental health problems and cancer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of people not being forced to wear masks on buses. This is because wearing a mask is an infringement of basic human rights. The group felt that wearing a mask is restricting and in some cases can trigger panic attacks/asthma attacks. The group also felt that masks are not necessary in every day life, especially now that COVID-19 is over. The group felt that people should be able to make their own decision and weigh up the pros and cons of mask wearing themselves before deciding if they would like to wear a mask on buses or not, it should not be made a mandatory ruling unless there is a threat at play.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Members of the public should not be forced to wear masks on buses. As a free country with freedom and rights, we can always advise people about what is expected of them in society, but we cannot force anything upon them. Even during a global pandemic, we can not force people to do something if it does not align with their beliefs, even if it clashes with personal ones. Wearing masks has been proven by research that they can reduce spread of airbourne diseases. However mask wearing has to continue to be individual choice because we do not know why someone refuses to don a mask. The reason for refusal can include physical health problems, breathing and lung conditions, disability, mental health problems and cancer.
