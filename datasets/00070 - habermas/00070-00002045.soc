# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “There should be a statutory requirement for schools to be open for a minimum number of days each year. Schools are crucial for the growth and development of students, as they are when students learn the most. With the rising cost of education, parents are relying more and more on their schools to educate their children, which is why it is essential that they are open a set number of days a year to allow children to progress in their learning. School is also an essential place for students to develop social skills, and therefore if schools were to be closed for extended periods of time, students would be likely to develop negative social skills, which may affect them throughout their lives. It is also important to consider children who may have less than ideal home lives and the role that schools play in keeping these children safe. Children may be put in danger at home and be subject to neglect or abuse, and therefore school can be a safe space for them to be.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Schools should be open a set amount of days a year. This is to allow schools to not disrupt the progression of students and ensure that students are able to fulfil their potential, so they can live their best life. Social skills are a crucial part of childhood and ensuring that schools are a safe environment for these skills to be learnt is imperative. Also, it is necessary that parents who work outside of the home are provided a safe place for their children to be whilst they are not able to look after them.” A record of the group's deliberations and their consensus statement is available to view here.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “School days are crucial for the growth and development of students, as they are when students learn the most. With the rising cost of education, parents are relying more and more on their schools to educate their children, which is why it is essential that they are open a set number of days a year to allow children to progress in their learning. School is also an essential place for students to develop social skills, and therefore if schools were to be closed for extended periods of time, students would be likely to develop negative social skills, which may affect them throughout their lives. However, schools must be closed for a minimum number of days each year. This is because it is important that the learning space is both physically and mentally healthy for children. This is also important as schools also play a vital role in ensuring that children are safe from harm. When schools are closed for extended periods of time, many parents are left struggling with how to care for their children, and in some cases this leads to children being in danger. Therefore, it is important that schools are closed for a minimum number of days a year in order to allow parents to cope and ensure children are kept safe.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “There should be a statutory requirement for schools to be open for a minimum number of days each year. School days are crucial for the growth and development of students, as they are when students learn the most. With the rising cost of education, parents are relying more and more on their schools to educate their children, which is why it is essential that they are open a set number of days a year to allow children to progress in their learning. School is also an essential place for students to develop social skills, and therefore if schools were to be closed for extended periods of time, students would be likely to develop negative social skills, which may affect them throughout their lives. Lastly, closing schools may lead to greater financial issues for parents, who will have to take off work to look after children during the day. This may have a negative impact on the economy of the country, so therefore keeping schools open will keep the economy going.”
