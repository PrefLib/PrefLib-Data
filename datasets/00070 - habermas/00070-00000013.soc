# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Most of the jury would like to see a living wage but feel that a set living wage would cause more problems than it would solve. Instead, we should encourage employers to pay higher wages by increasing the minimum wage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a set living wage, as it will increase the quality of life of those who receive it. A higher minimum wage would also help increase the living wage, but it would be more useful to set a living wage. It is important that a living wage is set, so that everyone receives the same amount of money.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The citizen's jury thought that a set living wage would cause more problems than it would solve. The jury discussed that the living wage is a set amount and is therefore an average. This means that some people would get a lower living wage and others would get a higher living wage. Some members of the jury thought that if people got more than the living wage, then this would be a disincentive to work harder and could result in the whole system of working to be undermined. If people got less than the living wage, this would be seen as unfair. Instead, the jury thought that we should encourage employers to pay higher wages by increasing the minimum wage.
