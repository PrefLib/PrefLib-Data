# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe employees should be offered more holidays for length of service and targets achieved. This will only be beneficial to the business if employees do not take too much time off at once and may sometimes even push employees to work harder to achieve their objectives. After-all, a fresh mind is vital to a healthy business.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We think that businesses should be allowed to allow their workers to have more holidays if the employees have worked for a considerable time with the company and have been performing well in their roles. The extra holidays could be an incentive for staff to stay with that company. If businesses choose to offer this to their staff it is essential that they do not risk the overall company by having too many staff members away at once. It is important to understand that a person needs a break from work every so often to keep their minds refreshed. A fresh mind will be able to work more efficiently and so a business can only benefit from this. We also agree that there should be a system in place to prevent to many staff being off at the same time so it would work for all parties concerned.

A fresh mind will be able to work more efficiently and so a business can only benefit from this. The extra holidays should not be handed to the staff on a plate but as an incentive for them to perform better, keep their place in the company and be seen as committed members of the workforce. It is essential that it is stated that staff need to maintain the balance between work and home life by not working so hard that the result is a chronic lack of free time.
