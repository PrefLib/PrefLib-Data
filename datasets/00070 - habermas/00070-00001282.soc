# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not end the sale of all new internal combustion engines.  We need to find an alternative that will meet the demand we currently have.  An alternative is costly and beyond the means of a lot of people.  We need to find a way to protect the environment and force innovation and improvement.  The best compromise would be subsidised electric engines and smaller more efficient combustion engines.  Larger engines such as tractors, heavy machinery and large vehicles, still have a big purpose in our society and we rely upon them alot.  Ending the sale of these engines without providing an adequate replacement will just be swapping one problem for another.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We agree that internal combustion engines should be phased out, but the immediate banning of them is not the answer. A phased approach that provides time for the infrastructure to cope with the increase in demand for other forms of energy should be implemented. The government should work to provide subsidies for electric engines and make changes to improve the infrastructure to cope with the increase in demand. In addition to this, the government should provide grants for research into electric engine technology to help it become more efficient and cheaper to manufacture.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that we should be moving towards the end of the sale of internal combustion engines in cars. They are harmful to the environment and are an inefficient use of energy. It may be difficult to come up with a suitable alternative that would be acceptable to all parties and also provide for the needs of the world's population. However, we do believe that it is necessary to take steps towards this goal. It is possible to phase out these engines, while also making a transition to electric or hybrid engines in order to provide for the needs of those who depend on cars.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the sale of internal combustion engines should be phased out. This is to reduce the harm to the environment and to encourage innovation and improvement. However, the sale of internal combustion engines should not be ended immediately. It is important to ensure that there is an adequate alternative to meet the demand. In particular, the sale of larger engines should not be ended immediately, as there is currently no adequate alternative.
