# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that non-essential plastics should be banned from supermarkets. This is because these plastics are not essential to the product and therefore are an unnecessary addition to the product and a waste of plastic. These plastics also often end up in landfill and the oceans where they can harm marine life. The removal of these non-essential plastics will also help consumers to be more mindful of the environmental impact of their purchases and promote a culture of sustainability.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should ban all non-essential plastics from supermarkets as this would be beneficial for the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, we should definitely ban non-essential plastics from supermarkets. Plastics can be essential for some products to increase shelf life, but lots of it is not necessary and only there to attract the consumers eye.  Charging for plastic carrier bags has proved to be a success, and if plastic is essential it should be white and easily recyclable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Yes, we should ban non-essential plastics from supermarkets. Plastic pollution is causing significant damage to the environment and many plastics cannot be recycled. This means that reducing the use of plastics will have an immediate positive impact on our environment.”
