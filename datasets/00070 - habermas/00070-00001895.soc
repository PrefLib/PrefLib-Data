# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Offering more financial incentives to young people to live and work in rural areas could be a viable strategy to address certain economic challenges and promote balanced regional development. The benefits would include; population re-distribution, boosting local economies, access to local talent (workers), community sustainability and keeping traditions going. It is believed, however, that there is a need to look at how we can incentivise young people to live and work in rural areas, while also balancing the need to protect the environment. For example, more opportunities for young people in terms of affordable housing would help encourage young people to live in rural areas, but this would require land to be set aside for development, which could be a risk to green space. Similarly, improving public transport links to rural areas would help encourage young people to live and work in rural areas, but the environmental cost of that would have to be considered.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should offer more financial incentives to young people to live and work in rural areas. This will ensure that rural areas will not become ghost towns and also promote balanced regional development.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should not offer financial incentives to young people to live and work in rural areas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of offering more financial incentives to young people to live and work in rural areas. The group believed that this would be a viable strategy to address certain economic challenges and promote balanced regional development. The benefits would include; population re-distribution, boosting local economies, access to local talent (workers), community sustainability and keeping traditions going. However, the group was also of the opinion that this would only work if the right infrastructure was in place to support it. This included; good public transport links, broadband access, access to amenities, etc. The group also believed that it was important to make sure that the incentives were not exploited in some way and that the land was not sold off for housing developments.
