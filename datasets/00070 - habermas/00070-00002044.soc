# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “In conclusion, Britain does have a debt problem. This is a result of a combination of factors, including the current economic crisis and cost of living crisis, a lack of financial awareness taught to children in schools and a culture of consumerism. In the current crisis, debt is unavoidable for a lot of families, it is either rely on credit or not be able to afford to keep the house over your head or feed your children. This is an issue that needs to be addressed and the government needs to provide support to families and individuals to help them avoid getting into debt and help those who are in debt to get out of it. The economic crisis and cost of living crisis is certainly a factor in the level of debt being accumulated. However, the amount of debt is so high that this can’t be the only factor and our culture and way of life must play a role.”

This is an issue that needs to be addressed and the government needs to provide support to families and individuals to help them avoid getting into debt and help those who are in debt to get out of it. Furthermore, the cost of living crisis needs to be addressed, by scrapping austerity and investing in public services, such as the NHS, social care and education.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “In conclusion, Britain does have a debt problem. This is a result of a combination of factors, including the current economic crisis and cost of living crisis, a lack of financial awareness taught to children in schools and a culture of consumerism. In the current crisis, debt is unavoidable for a lot of families, it is either rely on credit or not be able to afford to keep the house over your head or feed your children. This is an issue that needs to be addressed and the government needs to provide support to families and individuals to help them avoid getting into debt and help those who are in debt to get out of it. In the long term, however, the government should be looking to avoid a situation where families and individuals are having to rely on credit in the first place, by providing the resources and support necessary for families to live comfortably on their incomes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Yes, Britain does have a debt problem. This is a result of a combination of factors, including the current economic crisis and cost of living crisis, the lack of financial education in schools and a culture of consumerism. Unfortunately, it’s worse during the pandemic because debt is unavoidable for a lot of families. And our government needs to do more to help families and individuals to get out of debt.”
