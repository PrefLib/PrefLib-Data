# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We agree that diesel vehicles are less efficient than other fuel sources and produce more pollutants. We would therefore consider taxing diesel vehicles higher than other fuel sources as a way to encourage the use of more efficient vehicles. However, it is unfair to impose a higher tax on existing vehicles and we feel that new vehicles that have an efficient alternative fuel source should be incentivised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to higher taxes on diesel vehicles. They felt that it would be unfair to existing owners and that there were other ways to reduce pollution from diesel vehicles. However, they felt that if the government were to provide incentives for new technologies, then they may be open to the idea of higher taxes on diesel vehicles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Diesel cars cause more pollution and should be taxed higher. Taxes should be higher for new diesel cars than older ones.
