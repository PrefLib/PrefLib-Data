# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, yes, however in many cases this appears to be what the ex-colony wants. In circumstances where the ex-colony desires more autonomy this should be granted. Several countries have chosen to join the Commonwealth for its benefits whilst some have chosen to leave. Each ex-colony should have the independence to decide whether it wishes to remain or leave.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There has been some influence over ex-colonies in the past, however there is less of a need to exert that influence now.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK still has a certain level of control over ex-colonies, although this varies from nation to nation. In circumstances where the ex-colony desires more autonomy, this should be granted. In other circumstances, the ex-colony may choose to remain under British influence for the benefits it receives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the UK has too much influence over its ex-colonies, and should in most cases relinquish its power to enable ex-colonies to choose their own path.
