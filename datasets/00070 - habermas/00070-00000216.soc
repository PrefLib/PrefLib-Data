# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We don't believe that it would be possible to fund this scheme in the UK, and that it would not work in the long term. We don't think that it would be a long term sustainable option and would have huge negative impacts on business. If this was an option that was adopted, we think it would make the economy worse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, as people would be less motivated to work for themselves and that would cause businesses to suffer. However, we think that an unconditional basic income would be beneficial for the economy in the long term as people would be able to invest more and increase productivity and supply.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although the idea of a basic income for all UK citizens is very attractive, the initial consensus is that the £10,000 amount is not feasible and will not lead to an improvement in the economy. The consensus view was that the amount should be set at a more realistic level and also that the amount should be means-tested so that those in most need would be eligible for it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the idea of a universal basic income in the UK is not a bad idea in theory but may not work in practice as £10,000 per year is not enough to live on. There would also be problems with implementation of the scheme, as people could take advantage of it. The issue is also not everyone's situation is the same, for example a single person with no children will have more disposable income than a family of 4 with two young children.
