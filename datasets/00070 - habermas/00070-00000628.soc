# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We should impose higher taxes on the richest people. However, it is important to be specific about what is meant by rich and how high the tax would be. The higher taxes would help to reduce inequality in society and also provide more revenue for public goods and social welfare programs.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should impose higher taxes on the richest people in society. This will reduce income inequality and ensure that those who have the highest amount of income are contributing a higher proportion of their income to society. The revenue from this tax can be used to help improve the lives of the poorest people in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that the richest people in society should pay more tax as they can afford to and the tax revenue can be used to provide welfare for the poorest in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, yes we should impose higher taxes on the richest people. It would help massively to reduce income inequality and prevent the richest people in society from having a complete chokehold on how society is run as in the current system, money is pivotal to buying power from politicians. Increasing taxes on the richest people in society would also help promote social justice and provide significantly more revenue for social welfare programs. Due to the significant wealth they have accumulated, they can afford to pay a larger share of taxes to support the public good.
