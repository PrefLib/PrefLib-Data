# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that in order to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, there needs to be an increase in the number of charging points. There is a need for more charging points as this is a major fear amongst drivers. It is essential that the charging points are accessible, inexpensive to use, and easily located. A wider distribution of charging points would make the cost of owning an electric vehicle more competitive with diesel and petrol cars. This would increase the likelihood of electric vehicles becoming the primary source of transport. There is a need for more awareness to be raised about electric vehicles and the benefits that they provide. We believe that the public should be given the opportunity to try these vehicles for themselves to understand the positive benefits that they provide. It is important that incentives are available to allow drivers to make the switch to electric vehicles and that there is enough information about the costs of owning an electric vehicle to support this.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Final consensus statement: We believe that in order to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, there needs to be a significant increase in the number of charging points. We believe that in order to allow electric vehicles to compete with diesel and petrol cars there is a need for more charging points as this is a major concern amongst many drivers. This is an area in which both public and private operators can be involved in the setting up of charging points. We believe that there is a need for more awareness to be raised about electric vehicles and the benefits that they provide. There is a need for electric vehicles to be seen on the roads and more information to be shared about the costs of owning an electric vehicle, more incentives to be provided to allow drivers to make the switch to electric vehicles, and for a cost of owning an electric vehicle to be made available. We believe that the public should be given the opportunity to try these vehicles for themselves to understand the positive benefits that they provide. There should be a wider distribution of charging points to make the costs of owning an electric vehicle more competitive with diesel and petrol cars. This would increase the likelihood of electric vehicles becoming the primary source of transport.

While most participants were unified about how to achieve this goal, there were some who found some downsides to the scheme, e.g. charging vehicles for long periods of
