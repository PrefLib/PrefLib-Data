# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although dogs tend to be more affectionate and loyal than cats, they also require more attention and exercise, and if not correctly trained and managed, can become a nuisance. Cats, on the other hand, are often happy to be left alone for periods of time and can provide comfort through their cuddles and purrs. Therefore, both cats and dogs make for good companions, it just depends what you are looking for from a pet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, a dog is better than a cat as a companion. However, this is dependent on what you want from a pet, your lifestyle and how you feel about cats and dogs in general. A dog is better for those who want a lot of companionship and attention and if they want to spend time outdoors with their pet. However, a cat is a good choice for those who want a pet that is relatively independent and doesn't require a lot of time and attention.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, dogs are better companions than cats. However, this is not always the case as some people prefer cats and some dogs. It is also dependent on the lifestyle of the owner as a dog requires more attention and is more suited to people who enjoy spending time with their pets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, a dog is a better companion than a cat. A dog is more affectionate and forms a closer bond with its owner. A dog is also more likely to want to spend time with its owner and will often accompany them on walks. A cat is more independent and will often go out on its own, returning home when it suits it. A cat is therefore less likely to provide its owner with company. However, some people may prefer cats as they are less demanding and require less attention.
