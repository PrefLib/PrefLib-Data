# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the BBC being funded by licence fees, however, they all agreed that the licence fee should be reviewed and the BBC should not be allowed to use the licence fee to fund programmes that are not of a high quality.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We are all fairly undecided on the question of whether the BBC should be funded entirely by licence fees. While some of us feel that the BBC provides content which is worth the cost of a licence fee, others of us feel that the BBC should not be provided with more money than other channels. All of us feel that it is important that the BBC is funded in a way which allows it to be unbiased, and not influenced by advertisers, but feel that there are other ways in which the BBC could be funded while still being unbiased.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the decision that the BBC should be funded by licence fees. We believe that the BBC is a vital part of the UK and is an important part of the British culture. We believe that the BBC is an important part of the British culture and is something that we should be proud of. We believe that the BBC should be funded by licence fees as this allows it to be more independent than if it were government funded. It also prevents the need for advertising revenue, which would also impact on independence. We think that the licence fee model also allows people to decide whether or not to pay a licence fee if they don't want to consume the content. We also think that the BBC is a neutral and unbiased organisation with their views which is really important so that our media isn't heavily biased like the newspapers or other television channels.
