# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of co-educational schools. We think that it is important for children to be exposed to both genders from a young age, so that they can develop respect for both genders and understand the differences between them. It is also important for children to be able to socialise with both genders, so that they can develop friendships and relationships with people of both genders. However, we think that there are some circumstances in which single-sex schools would be beneficial. For example, if a child is being bullied by a child of the opposite gender, it may be beneficial for them to attend a single-sex school. We also think that there are some subjects in which boys and girls may learn better in single-sex classes. For example, in a class on menstruation, girls may feel uncomfortable if boys are present.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of schools being co-educational. However, we felt that there should be some single sex schools for those who want them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes. We think that all schools in the UK should be co-educational.  We believe that separating genders can have a negative effect on the future life of the child and lead to more sexism and stereotyping.  In addition, there is the argument that children should be exposed to both genders in school so that they are more prepared for the real world and can deal with issues relating to the opposite gender in a more effective manner.  Children should be able to feel comfortable and open around the opposite gender.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although there are arguments for and against single sex education, we believe that it is important to understand others, and to treat others with respect. Having a diverse school community which is co-educational, helps with this.
