# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the government should provide universal healthcare. However, there are some exceptions. For example, people who are not citizens of the UK should not be given free healthcare. Also, people who are very wealthy should be made to pay for some of their treatment, so that the government can use this money to help the poorest in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the UK government providing universal healthcare. The group felt that it was the government's duty to ensure that all people in the UK have access to healthcare, and that this should be provided for free. The group also felt that this was a moral obligation of the government, and that the government should prioritise this over other things. The group felt that the NHS needed a major overhaul, with staff being given pay rises, and with consultants' pay being capped. The group also felt that people from overseas should be made to pay for their healthcare, and that this should be means tested.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It was thought that the government should provide universal healthcare. However, this should not be completely free to all, as this would cause problems. It was thought that the government should provide healthcare for all people, but a means tested system should be put in place to see what people could afford to pay. This would mean that people who can afford to pay a part of their treatment costs would do so, thus allowing more people to receive treatment. The money from these payments would go to funding the most disadvantaged in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should provide universal healthcare, but only for people who are british citizens.
