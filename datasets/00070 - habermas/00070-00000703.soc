# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be more spending on health, especially on preventative measures, but also on training and wages of staff. The government needs to invest in the NHS and stop privatisation, while also putting an end to the PFI scandal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be more public spending on health.  However, this should be done in a cost effective way.  A lot of money is wasted on ineffective treatments and processes.  More money should be spent on health education to prevent disease and on effective treatments that can cure disease and promote health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be more public spending on health. The health service is a cornerstone of what makes this a great country to live in. It should not be seen as a burden to society and the tax payer, but as an investment in the health, welfare and future productivity of our country. As such it should be invested in and nurtured to flourish ensuring it provides the best service possible to every citizen.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be more public spending on health. The emphasis should shift from cure to prevention. The ridiculously expensive PFI scams Mr Brown introduced should be ended. Once that has happened we can take stock and see how much is needed. Probably we spend enough but waste 30% of it.
