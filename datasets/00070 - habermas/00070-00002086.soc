# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, it is not okay to build on brownfield land if it reduces the total amount of green space in a city. However, if the brownfield land was previously used for industrial purposes and was therefore already reducing the total amount of green space in a city, then it is okay to build on it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, it is not okay to build on brownfield land if it reduces the total amount of green space in a city. This is because green space is vital for the mental health of city residents, as well as providing a home for wildlife. However, if the brownfield land was previously used for industrial purposes, it is likely that the green space has already been reduced. In this case, it is okay to build on the land if it is for a good purpose, such as housing, and if the land has been thoroughly checked for safety.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, it is not ok to build on brownfield land if it reduces the total amount of green space in a city. It is important that cities have green spaces to help them clean the air and reduce pollution, and for the citizens to use as recreational space and to relax in. The issue is complicated however, because sometimes building on brownfield land is a good idea, if the land has been properly cleaned, and the building will bring a lot of benefits to the city. The people of the city should be able to voice their opinion, and have a say in what happens with the brownfield land.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is not acceptable to build on brownfield land if it reduces the total amount of green space. This is because, green space is vital for biodiversity, recreation and city dwelling residents' mental health. It would also increase the negative effects of urbanisation, which already includes increased pollution, a reduced amount of natural land, and increased climate change.
