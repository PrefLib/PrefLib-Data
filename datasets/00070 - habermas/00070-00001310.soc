# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to another referendum on Scottish independence. The reasons for this were that the question had already been asked and answered, and that the Scottish National Party was simply trying to get the answer that they wanted. The group felt that the SNP was trying to use the Brexit vote to their advantage and that it was an unfair tactic. The group felt that the SNP was not acting in the best interests of the Scottish people, and that they were using the referendum to further their own political agenda. The group felt that it was important to respect the democratic process and that it would be wrong to hold another referendum so soon after the last one.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should not be a referendum on Scottish independence. The UK has been a longstanding and successful union, sharing history, institutions and achievements that provides stability, economic benefits, and position on the international stage. Dividing the country could undermine the shared values and achievements built over centuries. Also, unity allows permits economies of scale, improves trade and market access, and monetary stability. The majority of Scottish people don't want one so it should be put to bed for a number of years before the question gets asked to them again.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should not be a referendum on Scottish independence. The Scottish and English have been together for so long, and the concept of separation and one day creating their own nation could have a profound impact on the stability of the UK. Not only would this result in changes in the foreign policy and trade relationships, but also the laws, tax policies, and other institutions. Creating a referendum on Scottish independence at this time could damage the relationship between Scotland and the UK, and undermine the stability of the union. We would like to know what other parties think on this question, and we would encourage you to submit your answer to this question and participate in the debate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While it is clear that the Scottish people have had an oppotunity to vote on the question, and voted against it, the SNP party continue to push for another referendum. It is clear that a new referendum would be met with very little favour with the UK government, and the majority of Scottish people. As such, we would argue that the government must be careful not to allow the SNP to achieve the goal of a second referendum as this could lead to a splitting of the country, or the break up of the union.
