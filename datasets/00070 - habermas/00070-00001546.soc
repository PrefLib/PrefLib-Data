# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the BBC should be broadcasting content that some people consider to be too offensive. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the BBC is a public service and should be reflecting the views of the public, not just a select few. Secondly, the BBC is a trusted source of news and information and should not be afraid to show the reality of the world, whether some people like it or not. Thirdly, there are many different views on what is considered to be offensive, and the BBC should not be afraid to show things that some people may find offensive, but others may not. Finally, the BBC is a large organisation with many employees, and it would be very difficult to make everyone happy all of the time. Therefore, it is important that the BBC is willing to show things that some people may find offensive, as long as they are in the public interest. However, there has to be a limit, and the BBC must consider the impact of the content on their audience. There is some content which is so offensive that it would be irresponsible to show it, as it would cause significant harm to many people.

Lastly, there are many different views on what is considered to be offensive, and the BBC should not be afraid to show things that some people may find offensive, but others may not. Thus, the BBC should be prepared to broadcast content that some people may find offensive, as long as it is in the public interest. Lastly, the participants considered the whole process of creating consensus opinions. The following are their experiences of the process. Participant 1: At first we debated a lot about the draft consensus, but having someone moderate the meeting was very beneficial in coming to a conclusion. We were also able to get our opinions across in a clear manner and subsequently make amendments as necessary.  Participant 2: Although there was more argument than agreement, it was still a fruitful and interesting experience. I have learned a lot from listening to other people's
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The BBC is a publicly funded organisation that should be serving the needs of the public. The BBC should not shy away from controversial issues. However, consideration should be given to the suitability of the content, in terms of both the subject matter and the time of broadcast, for the intended audience.

In these instances, the BBC must draw a line. Finally, the BBC is a large organisation with many employees, and it would be very difficult to make everyone happy all of the time. Therefore, it is important that the BBC is willing to show things that some people may find offensive, as long as they are in the public interest. It is necessary for the BBC to balance the fact that it needs to be in the public interest with the fact that the content must also be accurate, and sometimes the two cannot be reconciled.
