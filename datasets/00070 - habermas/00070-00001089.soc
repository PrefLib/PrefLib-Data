# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “After a debate, we came to the consensus view that the government should provide more funding for public universities. A number of participants felt that the cost of university is currently too high and that this is preventing many people from going. As well as this, people are graduating with a large amount of debt that they will have to pay off for the rest of their lives. If more funding was provided for public universities, this would be used to reduce the cost of university and also help with providing people from poorer backgrounds with the same opportunities as those from richer ones. We did also consider whether funding should be provided for private universities but felt that these should be privately funded as this will be good for the economy. The group debated whether more funding should be provided to help to improve the quality of education and improve facilities but we all felt that this should be done by the universities themselves through increasing the fees they charge to students.” Participants critiqued their fellow participants’ consensus statement below, and in doing so, began to see the value of the Round Robin Writing Technique: “I feel like this method of writing a paper was good in the sense that we could all work on the same ideas, however, it would probably be better suited to

However, we also debated whether the government should provide more funding for education and in particular to support schools and colleges and we all felt that this should be a priority. Education is so important to society and so the government should be doing all it can to improve it.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “The government should provide more funding for public universities. The current cost of university is too high. The high cost of university is preventing many people from going because of the amount of debt they graduate with. If more funding is provided to public universities this could be used to reduce the cost of university and also help with providing people from poorer backgrounds with the same opportunities as those from richer ones. Funding should be provided to reduce inequality, not to increase it. This funding could be used to lower the cost of university but could also be used to provide other forms of financial support such as bursaries for poorer students. A number of participants did also consider whether funding should be provided for private universities but felt that these should be privately funded as this will be good for the economy. In addition, the group debated whether more funding should be provided to help to improve the quality of education and improve facilities but we all felt that this should be done by the universities themselves through increasing the fees they charge to students.”
