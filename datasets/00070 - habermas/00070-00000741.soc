# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although malaria is a very difficult disease to control, it is possible to reduce its incidence through widespread education programmes and a multi-pronged approach to the eradication of the disease.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although the world is making progress in the fight against malaria, it is very unlikely that it will be eradicated. In the poorest countries, it is very unlikely that the disease will be completely eradicated, however there is hope that it can be controlled to a manageable level.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In the short term, malaria will not be eradicated. This is because there are a number of countries where malaria is widespread and where the necessary infrastructure is not in place to support eradication. In the longer term however, malaria will be eradicated. This will be made possible by improvements in technology and medicine. There will be a greater understanding of the biology of malaria, which will lead to the development of more effective treatments. Vaccines will also be developed which will prevent malaria from taking hold. Finally, education and awareness of the dangers of malaria will lead to a change in attitudes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Malaria is a resilient disease, however, with the help of scientific research and technological advancements, malaria can be eradicated in the near future. It is a matter of political will and funding.”
