# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is a good idea to ban certain products in children's television programs like junk food and any adult content. Expensive toys and games should also be banned because it puts pressure on parents to buy them. Banning these products from children's television will remove the pressure from parents to provide everything the children want.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, advertising in children's programs is a good idea. However, it should be limited to certain products. This would be to avoid putting pressure on parents to buy expensive toys or unhealthy foods for their children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion it is the opinion of the majority that advertising in children's programs is not a good idea and we recommend that children should be banned from viewing adverts on television.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be some ban on adverts as it can cause conflict within families and also encourage children to want things that their families cannot afford. There should not be a complete ban on adverts as this is a freedom of speech. It is the responsibility of parents to keep their children informed as to the realities of life and to make the best choices for them.
