# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should remain with pounds, as it makes little sense to align with a currency we have no control over. Furthermore, the conversion costs would be too high to bear.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group have come to the consensus view that we should not switch to the Euro as we are no longer part of the EU.  We did not use the Euro when we were in the EU and therefore it would not make sense to use it now.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, it would be more confusing to people, and there would be too much restructuring to do. We are better off just sticking to our own currency and having other European countries accept that.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Given the recent political events, the UK will stay with its own currency and not adopt the Euro as its currency.  This would be costly and cause much disruption in the short-term and would only benefit Europe in the long-term.  It is best to stay with our own currency in order to preserve our independence.
