# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that the government should not guarantee every citizen access to a university education.  We believe that it should be available to all, but only to those who can show they are equipped to deal with it and would benefit properly.  It is not appropriate for everyone, and it is not necessary for everyone.  We also believe that the government should provide access to university education to those who might otherwise miss out on it and both want and would benefit from the education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of a government guaranteeing every citizen access to a university education. The group was in favour of the idea that university should be a privilege for those who want it and can handle it, and that access to university should be granted on the basis of ability. The group also agreed that a university education is not for everyone and that other opportunities such as apprenticeships are equally as important.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that every citizen should have the right to access to university education, however, there should be some form of assessment to ensure that they are capable of handling the workload. This would ensure that the quality of the university is not degraded and that the graduates are of a high standard. This would also help to keep the university system fair and would not allow for those who do not deserve a place to take the place of someone who does. This would also help to keep the quality of the university high, as it would not be swamped with people who are not capable of handling the workload.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of a government guaranteeing every citizen access to a university education.  The group believed that this would create a situation where some citizens would be attending university who were not suited to it, would not benefit from it, and who would not want to attend.  This would result in a waste of resources and the potential for the creation of a large number of unhappy, frustrated graduates.  The group believed that the government should make university education accessible to all citizens who want to attend, but that the decision to attend should be based on the individual's desire and suitability for the education.
