# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of compensation for pollution caused by high emissions. The group felt that it would be unfair to compensate people in some areas but not others, and also felt that this would be a financial transfer from people who live in areas with low pollution to people who live in areas with high pollution. However, the group did feel that people should be compensated if they are severely affected by high emissions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should compensate people for pollution caused by high emissions in their neighbourhood. High emissions can lead to severe health problems and affect their children. If the government aren't actively trying to reduce emissions then people should be compensated financially. This compensation could lead to people being able to save up quicker to move away from these high emission areas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of compensation. However, the group felt that in cases where the government was actively promoting the purchase of vehicles which produce high emissions, then the government should be held responsible for the consequences. In these cases, the government should compensate the victims.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the government should not compensate people for pollution caused by high emissions in their neighbourhood, rather it should concentrate on the reasons why emissions are high in the first place. By compensatin victims, it does not address the root causes which can then continue unabated, leading to a never ending escalation of higher and higher emissions causing misery for the local people. However, if the government are not actively trying to reduce emissions then people should be compensated financially. This compensation could lead to people being able to save up quicker to move away from these high emission areas. However, the government should also ensure that road vehicles are made cleaner. And to prevent such problems in the future, prosecute the members of the New Labour government who caused this problem in the first place by encouraging everyone to buy dirty diesel-engined cars.
