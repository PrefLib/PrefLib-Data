# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - i would argue yes they definitely do have the majority of responsibility to educate their children regarding pornography, however sex education in school should cover the topic as well, parents instead of just blocking pornographic websites and not approaching the subject, should educate their child about what it is and the negatives and positives associated with it
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes they do have a responsibility as otherwise their children will find out from their school friend's and then they may not be educated properly. Schools should also educate them on the topic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Who else would that responsibility come down to? My first thought was do we need to be 'taught' about pornography but then on second thought it would probably make the world a little better if people were taught that this is not an accurate representation of 'real life' etc. So I do believe that if it is to be anyone to educate children about pornography it should be the parents. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, the overall responsibility lies with the Parents. We have good security measures on our digital devices which allows us to filter out harmful content and are able to monitor what the child is doing online.  During school hours there is not much opportunity or ability to visit harmful sites whereas, at home, there is.  There are of course tech savvy children who would be able to bypass the filters but overall it should be the Parents responsibility
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - Though I think there's value in sex education/awareness for children, I think pornography should only be discussed with older children and shouldn't be a focus of education. It should merely be presented as what it is: entertainment for adults that can, sadly, enforce standards and stereotypes which may not be very healthy. There should also be a discussion around the risks of pornography. That said, it should still be discussed and should not be presented as tabboo/bad. Sex education from schools or parents should be focussed on facts only.
