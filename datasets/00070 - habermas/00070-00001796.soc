# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, the King is too powerful and he should have no say in any political matters.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The King has too much power in my view. He is a head of state and cannot even have a political opinion on a matter or rather he cannot bring it to bear. He even has to sign laws into place that he may not agree with as a result. However I think it is misguided to believe that the King only has symbolic power. He has huge influence and wealth which comes with power. I do not believe the King has too much power. He must give his permission to parliament to pass any legislation, however his say is rarely taken into account. In my practice the King has been known to make political statements in public and private and the royal family has been known to privately influence and lobby against legislation they're not in favour of. The view is also somewhat conflicting. He cannot both have huge influence and not too much power. Ultimately, public money should not be used to fund a family that is largely a historic hangover of imperialism. We should be a democracy. The king should have more say in political matters as it is his country and more say in what laws are put in place or not. Currently he has not say in it whether he agrees or not. This is explained very well, short but firm
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The King does not have too much power in my view. He is a head of state and cannot even have a political opinion on a matter or rather he cannot bring it to bear.
