# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No certainly not at this stage. We need to give it more time to see the final outcomes. All trade deals and arrangements have not been concluded so we cant tell  quite how beneficial it is yet. Opposing political parties are using this as a  very unhelpful tool for their own gain instead of helping with negotiations and conclusions. Yes their have been problems but they are slowly being ironed out. We need to be patient then decide when we have all the answers
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I think it would be a good idea to hold a second referendum now as people have been given enough time to see the lies in the original campaigns. The majority of the promises for the leave campaign have been proven to be lies. As far as I can see there has been no benefit at all to leaving, In fact, it seems to have been quite detrimental to the UK economy. I don't believe people fully understood what they were voting for and the consequences of leaving the EU.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No. There has been so much disruption already in disconnecting from the EU and the economy initially suffered as this transitionary phase happened,  a further referendum would do a lot of damage to the economy showing Britain as being indecisive and 'flaky'. A decision has been made; processes, trade agreements etc have been been put in place, to raise a further question mark would have big global companies that invest in the UK worried about the stability of the economy and may decide that other nations are a better option.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, i dont think there should be. We live in a democratic country where an election was held. The results should therefore be upheld.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Although I believe that Brexit was a mistake and that everything that has happened from Brexit has been rubbish quite frankly. I don't think that you can just call a second referendum. The general public unfortunately made their decision and therefore we have to live with the consequences.
