# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People have a right to choose to gamble on sport or not. If they want to gamble then they should be allowed to do so. However, the gambling industry should have strict rules in place to prevent people becoming addicted to gambling. This should include the ability to set daily, weekly, and monthly deposit limits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, gambling is a negative influence on society. However, banning gambling would be a step too far and would be an infringement on personal freedoms. Instead, we believe that the gambling industry should be more heavily regulated. Gambling advertising should be banned from all forms of sports broadcasting, and there should be restrictions on the amount of money that people are allowed to deposit into their gambling accounts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to a ban on gambling. We recognise that some people can become addicted to gambling and that this can cause serious problems for them and their families. We also recognise that there are laws in place to protect people from spending more than they can afford and that it is the responsibility of the gambling companies to enforce these laws. We think that people should be free to make their own choices and that they should be responsible for their own actions. We think that people should be allowed to take part in gambling if they want to, but that there should be greater restrictions on gambling advertising during sporting events.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should not ban gambling on sport. People should be free to make their own decisions and gambling is something that some people enjoy as a hobby. We believe that the gambling industry has a responsibility to protect people from problem gambling, and to not actively encourage gambling by vulnerable people who may have addictive personalities. We believe that advertising gambling should be tightly controlled and restricted from sports broadcasting, and that there should be tight regulations on the amount of money that can be deposited into a gambling account.
