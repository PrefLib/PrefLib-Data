# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to have their own Instagram account. Instagram is a social media platform that has become incredibly popular, especially with young people. This has resulted in a lot of children feeling pressured to have their own account, as they feel they are missing out on something. This is not the case, children under the age of 13 should be encouraged to spend their time with their friends and family, enjoying the outdoors, playing sports and having fun. They should not be exposed to the pressures of social media, which can lead to issues with their self-esteem, as they are comparing themselves to others and feeling as if they are not good enough. They should not be exposed to the bullying that is prevalent on social media, and they should not be exposed to content that is not age appropriate. Instagram is a social media platform that is not suitable for children under the age of 13.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, I do not believe that children under the age of 13 should have their own instagram account, as I believe that they should be outside and playing with friends rather than being sat inside looking at social media all day.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to have their own Instagram account. There are many risks associated with young children having access to social media and we feel that the age restriction of 13+ should remain in place.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It was agreed that the negative aspects of social media far outweigh the positives for children under 13 having their own account. We agreed that there are many issues surrounding social media, for example, cyberbullying, over exposure to the lives of others and young children feeling inferior to their peers and the potential for young children to view inappropriate content. Although there are parental controls that are available on these accounts, we felt that these can be easily bypassed or misused by children. We also agreed that it is very difficult to limit what is viewed on social media and that young children may be exposed to things that are not age appropriate. We felt that allowing children under 13 to have their own account does nothing to help them develop socially and this time could be better spent developing relationships and hobbies offline.
