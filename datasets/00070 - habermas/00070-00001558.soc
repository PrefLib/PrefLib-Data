# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should tax the wealthy more. This is because they are the people who have the most money and therefore can afford to pay more. Also, the tax that they pay will be used to benefit society and help those who are less fortunate. This is only fair, as the wealthy have more than enough money to live comfortably and can afford to pay more tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, but only if the threshold for lower income households is reduced. There should be no tax on the first £5000 that anyone earns. This would incentivise individuals to get out there and work for themselves as it would not be taken away from them by the government. The government would still make money as individuals will start paying tax when they start earning £5000, and will continue to pay it on anything over £5000. This will also increase the disposable income of lower income households, meaning that they will spend more money and the economy will benefit. It is also believed that the wealthy already pay their fair share, and if anything they should be encouraged to invest their money in companies that will create more jobs for the nation. This should also help to prevent tax evasion as there will be more checks and balances. The government should also provide more tax breaks for smaller businesses, so that they can expand their businesses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should not tax the wealthy more. It would not be fair as those who work hard to get to where they are and deserve to have some of the money that they earn as a reward for their hard work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the wealthy should be taxed more. There should be a higher tax rate for those who earn more than a certain amount, as they have a greater ability to pay. This would help to reduce the tax burden on the lower income households and help to alleviate poverty. This would also help to reduce the tax evasion that occurs when the wealthy are taxed less. The wealthy should also be taxed more on luxuries, as these are non-essential items. This would help to reduce the inequality in society and ensure that everyone is contributing their fair share to society.
