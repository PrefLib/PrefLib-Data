# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, mobile phones should not be allowed in schools. It will only distract school children. However, if it is a boarding school, students should be allowed to use mobile phones once in a while, to keep them abrest with happenings around them. Mobile phone use in schools would cause so many unwanted happenings. Some of the students will engage in pornographic contents, social media, games and all sort while in school. These activities will hinder their learning. A central phone can be placed in school in case they need to talk to their parents.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the use of mobile phones in schools should be discouraged but not banned. As in most other spheres of society, their use should be regulated. The use of mobile phones should be discouraged during class and during other formal activities within the school. The school should regulate the use of mobile phones during non-formal activities, but if they are deemed to be a cause of distraction or misbehaviour, they should be confiscated and returned to the student's parents. The phones should be returned at the end of term. This regulation should apply to teachers as well. It is important to remember that mobile phones are part of society and denying students the right to use them could lead to a decrease in the level of their interest in education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although mobile phones have a number of advantages for students in school, such as the ability to contact family, and the convenience of having all necessary information in one device, they also have a number of disadvantages, such as being a distraction from learning, being a means of bullying and also a means of cheating. As such, mobile phones should be banned in school, unless there is a genuine emergency or need for a student to contact a family member.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a ban on mobile phones in schools. Students can keep their mobile phones on them at all times. In the case of an emergency, students can use the phones outside the classroom but they will not be allowed to use them inside the classroom. The use of mobile phones should be banned in schools as it can be very distracting for students, as well as those around them.
