# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK government should spend more money on renewable energy research. We live in a time where climate change is a real threat. The weather is becoming more and more extreme with every season. The UK has the potential to generate a large amount of its energy from renewable sources. The government should invest more in this area to reduce the countries carbon footprint and make the country more energy independent. The UK is also a leader in the renewable energy field and the government should continue to invest in this area to ensure that the UK remains a leader in this field.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK government should spend more money on renewable energy research. The climate change is real and we are in a very big danger. We can see that the weather is changing and becoming more and more extreme with every season. More funds need to be spend on research. The UK as a country is quite vulnerable to the effects of global warming. It is important that the UK government continues to invest heavily on renewable energy research and it is important to ensure that the approach of investing is in a targeted way. The benefits of investing properly in renewable energy research within the UK could be massive. The ability for the UK to effectively implement renewable energy such as solar, wind and hydro is excellent due to the terrain, weather and landscape available. The benefits such as lower carbon emissions and new economic opportunities far outweigh the initial costs in the long run. Some may argue there are pressing concerns which require investment, but for long term issues, renewable energy dependence is important.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that the UK government should spend more money on renewable energy research. The reason for this is because it is important for the UK to invest in the future and to move forward. The current methods of energy production are not sustainable and are damaging the environment. We feel that by investing in renewable energy research, we can reduce the effects of climate change and also create new economic opportunities. The benefits of such an investment are huge and outweigh the initial costs. We also feel that by investing in renewable energy, the UK can become a leader in this area and can be a role model for other countries to follow.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK government should spend more money on renewable energy research. The UK is in a very vulnerable position to the effects of global warming and is at risk of flooding and extreme weather conditions. The government should invest in research that is targeted and ensures that the UK is not at risk of these threats. The UK has excellent potential to implement renewable energy sources due to the weather and landscape. The benefits of investing in renewable energy research would be to protect the UK from the effects of global warming and to reduce carbon emissions.
