# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to any form of alcohol restriction. They felt that this would be a step too far and that there were better ways of tackling alcohol abuse. The group felt that there were already enough laws in place to tackle alcohol abuse and that people should be responsible for their own actions. However, the group did agree that alcohol sales in supermarkets should be more tightly controlled and that supermarkets should not be allowed to sell alcohol so cheaply. The group also agreed that the government should do more to educate people about the dangers of alcohol.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group came to the consensus view that we should not restrict alcohol sales. This is because people will find ways around the restriction and is an infringement on individual rights. The answer may lie in education and by making alcohol more expensive. This will reduce the amount of alcohol people consume and hopefully reduce the health risks associated with alcohol consumption.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Yes, the government should restrict the amount of alcohol people can buy. The UK has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in Europe and this is having a detrimental effect on people’s health. It is also costing the NHS a lot of money to treat alcohol related illnesses. There are many other countries in Europe that have a much lower rate of alcohol consumption and this is because they have much stricter laws in place to control the sale of alcohol. The government should look to these countries to see how they can replicate their success in the UK.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that the government should restrict the amount of alcohol people can buy. The main reason for this is the risk of harm that alcohol consumption can cause. The increase in crime due to alcohol consumption will be a significant cause for concern for the public and will have to be dealt with by the police. The police would have to waste more time on dealing with crimes due to alcohol consumption rather than spending more time in the community and catching criminals. If the government do restrict the amount of alcohol people can buy, this will reduce the chance of people drinking excessively.
