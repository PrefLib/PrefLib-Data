# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the UK should not ban imports of products that are made in countries with a low minimum wage. It is not the UK's place to dictate the minimum wage of other countries. However, it is important to ensure that workers in these countries are not being exploited and are being paid a fair wage. It is important to note that the minimum wage in each country will differ and will be relative to the cost of living in that country. The UK should not support slave labour or poverty wages.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the UK should not ban imports of products that are made in countries with a low minimum wage. This is because the minimum wage is relative to the economy of the country that it is set in, and therefore our standard of minimum wage is much higher than somewhere such as India or China, where relative costs are lower. Also, it doesn't make sense to blanket ban imports from an entire country because of their government policy of minimum wage, when it is conceivable that many companies within that country could be offering more than it. However, the UK should not support slave labour or poverty wages, and we should look at why workers are being paid so badly and how this can be addressed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the UK should not ban imports of products that are made in countries with a low minimum wage. The minimum wage is relative to the economy of the country that it is set in, and therefore our standard of minimum wage is much higher than somewhere such as India or China, where relative costs are lower. It doesn't make sense to blanket ban imports from an entire country because of their government policy of minimum wage, when it is conceivable that many companies within that country could be offering more than it. However, we should be aware of the human rights implications of the low minimum wage, and ensure that the workers are being treated fairly and are not being exploited.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, the UK should not ban imports of products that are made in countries with a low minimum wage. The UK cannot set the minimum wage of other countries, and it would not be practical to ban all imports from a country because of the low minimum wage of some of its companies. It would also be very difficult to define what a low minimum wage is, and who would be responsible for enforcing this. It would also be very difficult to define what a low minimum wage is, and who would be responsible for enforcing this. The best way to improve the situation would be to encourage companies to pay their workers a living wage, and to improve the working conditions of their factories.
