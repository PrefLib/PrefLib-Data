# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: I agree that taxes need to be raised on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service. We believe that this is fair because the NHS is a vital service which needs more funding.The rich can afford to pay more and we need to all pull together to support the NHS. We believe that the rich have worked hard but they should help the NHS. A better way to tax highly paid individuals would be levying a high value goods tax. For example large taxes on property worth £1 million or more on things like first class travel and luxury goods. In a globalised world it is too easy for high net worth individuals to move their money around to avoid harsh tax regimes. We believe that the top rate currently does not do enough to support the NHS. We believe that an additional top rate on extremely high wages is needed in order to support the NHS and make up for reductions in funding. For example an additional top rate on extremely high wages.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK should raise taxes on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service. We believe that this is fair because the NHS is a vital service which needs more funding. The rich can afford to pay more and we need to all pull together to support the NHS. We believe that the rich use private health care but they should still be willing to contribute their fair share to such a vital service. The top rate currently does not do enough to support the NHS. We believe that an additional top rate on extremely high wages is needed in order to support the NHS and make up for reductions in funding. We believe that the rich have worked hard but they should help the NHS.
