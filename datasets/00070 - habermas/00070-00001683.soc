# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Hunting with dogs should be banned as it is a form of animal cruelty. If people want to hunt, they should do it without dogs. The question is whether the group of participants has come to the right answer to the question.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is not acceptable to hunt wild animals with dogs as it can cause pain and stress to the hunted animal, and the fact that the animal has little chance of escape against the dogs is just wrong. Also, the act of hunting with dogs is classed as a sport and is not fair for the hunted animal, who has no choice in what is happening. This has gone on for many a year and is seen by some as a sport, but there really is too much suffering for the hunted animal, and to cause suffering is to show ourselves to be brutal and poor ethically. We wish humans to be better than this and to have a decent ethical code in our dealings with each other, and we also need to reflect this in our other actions. To fail in this is to teach our children the wrong lessons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should have a law against hunting wild animals with dogs because it causes them pain and distress and is ethically wrong. Also it teaches the wrong lessons to children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a law against hunting wild animals with dogs. This is because the amount of pain and stress the hunted animal goes through is just not right. It's also not fair for the animal when it doesn't stand a chance against a large pack of dogs. I understand that this has gone on for many a year, and to some is classed as a sport, but there really is too much suffering for the hunted animal. It also reflects on how we are as a human species. If we are willing to allow brutality and pain in wild animals then we are showing ourselves to be brutal and poor ethically. If we wish humans to be better than this and to have a decent ethical code in our dealings with each other then we also need to reflect this in our other actions. To fail in this is to teach our children the wrong lessons. It really depends on whether or not the wild animals are a huge problem or not and it also really depends on what the wild animals are and if they are likely to go extinct by people hunting them, also how humane it is to use dogs to hunt them. Life is sacred and humans are equal to ants and any other life in my view. I only
