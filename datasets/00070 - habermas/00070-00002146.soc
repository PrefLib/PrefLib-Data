# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “I feel that the market for private healthcare is not needed in the UK. The NHS offers a free and highly efficient service that should be able to meet the needs of everyone in the UK. Although private healthcare can provide a service to those who are wealthy and feel that they have the money to invest in it, I think that there are many more important services that the private healthcare money could be invested in such as research or community health services. Private healthcare companies will prioritise their profit margins and will make the service expensive. We need to invest more money in the NHS to provide an excellent service for all and not rely on private healthcare.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Private healthcare should be available for those who can afford it, but it must also help the NHS. Private healthcare must also be affordable and accessible for everyone and all types of healthcare and treatments must be available. It must not increase the gap between rich and poor, and the wealthier must not be prioritized over the poorer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be a market for private healthcare. There should be a clear separation between the NHS and private healthcare, and people should be able to choose to go to private healthcare. Private healthcare should not be prioritised over the NHS, and should not be used to reduce waiting times. The NHS should have more funding and be more efficient. The NHS should also have a role in private healthcare, and should be able to provide some treatments to private healthcare patients.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a market for private healthcare. The NHS should not be abolished, but there should be more choice for those who can afford it.
