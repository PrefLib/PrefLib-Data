# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We agree that the UK should adopt the universal basic income but we do not feel like it should be paid to those with high income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Consensus View: After the group had a long discussion on the topic, we decided that we would be in favour of the idea. We feel like it could be a way to solve the issue of poverty, and to make sure that everyone has a comfortable life and is able to live their life without the worry of money. This is particularly important in a country like the UK, where there are a lot of people who are not able to work and are struggling to pay for the basic needs. We also feel like it could have an impact on mental health, and it will stop people from having to worry about paying for things like electricity, food, rent etc. And then it will allow them to focus on the things that are important. However, there could be some issues with this. The first one is that people may not work, and this could be an issue if there is not enough money coming into the country to fund this. Secondly, there may be people who do not need this money, but they may be able to get it, and this is an issue because then there is a waste of money. But overall, we believe that it is something that should be tried.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of adopting a similar approach to the Universal Basic Income experiments that are currently running in Finland, and the Netherlands. However, the group was of the opinion that the basic income should be targeted at those who need it most, and not everyone in society. The group felt that the basic income should be set at a level that is enough to provide the basic necessities of life, and should be set at a level that is enough to provide the basic necessities of life, and should be adjusted for inflation. The group also felt that the basic income should be means tested, and that those who can afford to support themselves should not be eligible for the basic income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of a universal basic income, but thought that the amount of money should be dependent on the person’s income. They also thought that this would be a good way to reduce poverty in the UK.
