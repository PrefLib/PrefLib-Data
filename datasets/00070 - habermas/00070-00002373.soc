# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children should not be required to wear uniforms in all schools. While it is a fact that there are some benefits to wearing uniforms, such as being identifiable, not having to worry about what to wear, and making children feel equal, it is also a fact that wearing uniforms is expensive for families, especially with more than one child. Furthermore, wearing uniforms does not necessarily improve educational outcomes for students. In addition, not requiring students to wear uniforms allows them to express their individuality, and does not discourage those who cannot afford uniforms from attending school.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the decision that we do not believe that students should be required to wear uniforms in all schools. We believe that uniforms are expensive for families, especially those with more than one child. Wearing uniforms does not improve educational outcomes for students, and should not be considered necessary. We believe that uniforms can be a good thing in some circumstances, such as making students identifiable, but that they should not be mandatory for all students.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of requiring students to wear uniforms in all schools. The group felt that the idea of requiring students to wear uniforms was an infringement on individuality and freedom of expression. The group also felt that requiring students to wear uniforms was an unnecessary expense for families. The group did concede however, that there were some benefits to students wearing uniforms, such as the reduction of bullying and teasing, and the idea that wearing uniforms encouraged students to focus on their education rather than their appearance. The group also conceded that uniforms may be beneficial for younger students, as they may not be able to dress themselves appropriately for school.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of requiring students to wear uniforms in all schools. The group felt that uniforms were expensive, and that requiring students to wear uniforms was an infringement on their freedom of expression. The group also felt that uniforms did not improve educational outcomes for students, and that requiring students to wear uniforms did not make them any smarter. The group did concede that uniforms may be useful in some schools, such as religious schools, or schools that have a history of bullying based on clothing. The group felt that the decision to require uniforms should be made on a case-by-case basis, and should not be a blanket policy for all schools.
