# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, there is not an ethical argument for raising taxes. Taxes are already being used in ways that are unacceptable to the public, and during the cost of living crisis, we should not be expected to pay even more only to end up homeless sooner. Our taxes should provide healthcare, or services, and to help those in need, but it seems most of our taxes end up in someones pocket. Until our economic situation can be addressed in a way that actually improves the lives of those around the world, taxes should stay the same for the public. Though the richest should be taxed to the same standard that we are, they should not be able to pocket more money than most of us will see in our lifetime.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In the UK, there is great economic inequality. The cost of living crisis is worse than ever, and many people in this country struggle daily to afford basic necessities such as food, rent and energy bills. Whilst this is going on, others in the country are making more money than they ever will need, and wealth is hoarded amongst these people. Raising taxes for these high earners, along with a government that spends its budget wisely and fairly, will easily solve many of the problems millions are facing today. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There are a few reasons I can think of to raise taxes. The main one that comes to mind is how under-funded the NHS is. The second, which should have been the first, is the fact that poverty still exists at all in this country. I believe in raising taxes for the very wealthy and corporations, lowering it for the less wealthy and small businesses. Or just re-allocating it!
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think taxes are necessary to provide the government with funds to maintain services and conditions in the country. Paying taxes is important and beneficial to everyone, however taxes are a large proportion of a person's salary. People who earn more money should pay higher taxes than people who earn less. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I understand the reasoning for doing it, as in to provide better support for things such as the NHS and so on, however I don't agree with it or think it's ethical. Raising taxes and not raising salaries is causing such a big issue for people in terms of cost of living. The rich stay rich, as they aren't wholly affected by the rise in taxes whereas it puts worse off people in an even worse position. It's not something that's in our control or that we're really allowed to have a say on, so it causes a lot of stress and worry in terms of finance, mental wellbeing and general day to day life.
