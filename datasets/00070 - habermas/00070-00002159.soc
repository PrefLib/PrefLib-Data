# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of using taxation to discourage people from smoking. This is because it is a very effective way of reducing the number of people who smoke. The group was also in favour of using the money raised from taxation to help people who are trying to stop smoking. This is because it would be a very effective way of helping people to stop smoking and would also help to reduce the number of people who smoke.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Smoking cigarettes is a major health risk and there are a lot of resources used by the NHS to help and support people who make the decision to smoke. Taxation is a good way to discourage people from smoking as it increases the price of cigarettes and this should lead to a reduction in the number of people buying cigarettes. However, this may not discourage those who are really addicted or can afford it anyway if they have more disposable income. The money used from the taxes could be put into government health care which would be a positive of this legislation. The group also agreed that there are much more productive ways to discourage people from smoking, and i think this includes the media and educating people while young. While there are benefits to taxing, this would just penalise the poorest from society, rather than creating a suitable alternative to smoking. Having cheap and effective ways to ease from smoking would benefit them better - especially if this is free on the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It was thought that the negative health effects of smoking cigarettes is something that is more and more widely known about, and so education on this subject is a much more effective way of reducing the number of people who smoke than any tax imposed by the government. Taxing cigarettes is seen as something that would make the poorest of society feel even more disadvantaged than they already do. However, it is thought that taxation would help to fund better health care services, which would improve the health of all society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: WE SHOULD NOT BECAUSE IT MAY MAKE POPLE GET MAD. ALSO, IT MAY MAKE THE GOVERMENT HAVE MORE MONEY, BUT IT MAY NOT BE A GOOD THING FOR THOSE WHO NEED THE MONEY.
