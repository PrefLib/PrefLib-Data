# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the UK has the right number of graduates, but with the current government encouragement for people to go to university, there are some cases where it is not the best thing for individuals. There are still shortages of certain skills within the UK, so it is still important that people have the opportunity to study at university. It would be good for the government to invest more in work-based training to ensure the skills are available for the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There is not a clear oversupply of university graduates in the UK, although there are certainly more people studying at university than in the past and some people would argue that we need to address this by making it more difficult to attend university. What is more concerning is that there are more people studying for university degrees that are not beneficial to the country. This is due to the governments drive to ensure that everyone, regardless of background, can attend university. There is also a growing need to encourage people to study in areas where there are shortages of skills in the UK, and we need to address this issue.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There is a degree of oversupply, but this is of particular concern in certain disciplines.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “I feel that the UK has a healthy number of university graduates that is helping to drive the economy and workforce forward. However I feel that there is a lack of focus and funding in areas such as nursing and teaching where there is a need for graduates. I feel that in areas of the country that are dependent on a primary sector there is a lack of supply of the right type of graduates that can be tapped into to help the country and economy to grow. This is in part down to the ‘wrong’ students attending university and a lack of career advice at school level.”
