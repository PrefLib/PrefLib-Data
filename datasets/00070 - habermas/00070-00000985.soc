# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Climate change is a very serious issue and will have really bad effects in the future. There isnt enough information being spread around and we are still extremely reliant on fossil fuels. The uk should be focusing more on renewable energy and putting in policies to reduce climate change and our carbon footprint.  There will be really extreme consequences otherwise. If the UK doesnt begin to acknowledge the detrimental effects of climate change on the world, and not just on our own country, it may become too late to reverse the damage, as the effects may become irreversible. This can then have catastrophic consequences for many generations to come.
