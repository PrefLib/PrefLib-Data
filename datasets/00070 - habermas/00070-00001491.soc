# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The BBC is a well-established organisation that provides a wide variety of programmes for the public. It is also impartial in its reporting and balances its debate accordingly. It is not beyond reproach, however, and has been subject to a number of scandals in recent years, which has called into question the impartiality of its reporting. The BBC is therefore subject to scrutiny, both internally and externally, to ensure that it is providing the public with a fair and balanced service. This will allow the BBC to continue to provide the public with a quality service.
