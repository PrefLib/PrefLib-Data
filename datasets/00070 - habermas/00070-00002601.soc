# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It has. Whilst it has bought some good things, closer world community, availability of information, the ability to easily stay in touch with people, it has also sewed division, given greater ability of access to illegal things and brainwashed people by exposing them to "facts" that are wrong. In the main, its a bad thing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It depends on the way you look at it. It has brought some people closer and others apart. Made some people/groups sociable and others anti-social. Has ruined the lives of many and has changed the lives of some people for the better. Has enabled negative addiction through easy access to pornography. It's hard to give a blanket yes or no answer. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: yes, the internet is full of negativity. Bullys can hide behind a screen and people are very influenced by things they see online. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The internet in general is a great thing and is on balance more positive than negative. It has provided great resources to all those who can access it. However it has also had some negative impact - specifically thinking about Social Media and the adverse impact it has had, especially in relation to young people. There are other issues with online gambling, pornography, the dark web etc. The question does not ask if the internet has had more of a negative effect than a positive effect.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I don't think so. It is one of the greatest inventions that allowed information to travel extremely easily. As with other things, it needs critical thinking and filtering before you believe in something and commit to it.
