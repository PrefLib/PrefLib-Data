# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the contributions of historically marginalised groups should be recognised and celebrated. We believe that the best way to do this is through a public holiday, which would be a great way to celebrate the diverse cultures that make up the UK. This should be a separate holiday, which would be a great way to celebrate the diverse cultures that make up the UK, and would also be a good way to educate people about the history of the UK and the important role that historically marginalised groups have played in shaping our society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the contributions of historically marginalised groups should be recognised and celebrated. We believe that the best way to do this is through a public holiday, which would be a great way to celebrate the diverse cultures that make up the UK. However, we do not think that this should be a separate holiday, as this would be divisive. Instead, we believe that this should be incorporated into existing holidays, such as the August bank holiday. This would be a great way to celebrate the diverse cultures that make up the UK, and would also be a good way to educate people about the history of the UK and the important role that historically marginalised groups have played in shaping our society. We also think that we should have some kind of museum which is dedicated to the history of the UK. This would be a great place where people could learn about the contributions made by historically marginalised groups, as well as other groups. It would also be a great place to host events to celebrate the diverse cultures of the UK. We believe that these changes would be a good way to honour the contributions made by historically marginalised groups, and celebrate the diverse cultures of the UK, thus improving race relations and combating discrimination.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the contributions of historically marginalised groups should be recognised and celebrated. We believe that the best way to do this is through a public holiday, which would be a great way to celebrate the diverse cultures that make up the UK. This should be a separate holiday, one which celebrates the contributions of marginalised groups. This would ensure that their efforts were recognised and remembered, as well as being a good way to celebrate the diverse cultures that make up the UK. This could be filled with information and events that educate people about the history of the UK and the important role that historically marginalised groups have played in shaping our society.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the contributions of historically marginalised groups should be recognised and celebrated. We believe that the best way to do this is through a public holiday, which would be a great way to celebrate the diverse cultures that make up the UK. However, we do not think that this should be a separate holiday, as this would be divisive.

This would be a great way to celebrate the diverse cultures that make up the UK, and would also be a good way to educate people about the history of the UK and the important role that historically marginalised groups have played in shaping our society. This would not dilute the importance of the contributions of historically marginalised groups, and would also not take away from the importance of the contributions of other groups of people, as we would still celebrate these on other days.
