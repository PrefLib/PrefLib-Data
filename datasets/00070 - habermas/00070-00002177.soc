# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Ultimately, the most important thing to remember is that alcohol is already a dangerous substance, especially for people who are driving, and making it illegal will only increase these dangers. Banning it will also just create a black market that could provide much more dangers. While alcohol is already dangerous due to drunk drivers and people who get into drunken fights or so drunk that they cause a danger to themselves or those around them in any way banning alcohol would likely only increase these dangers with black market dealings. Banning alcohol is thus not the answer, and we must educate people on how to use it in a safe and healthy manner.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we should not make alcohol illegal. The arguments in favour of this include the fact that alcohol is enjoyed by many people, and is an important part of social life for many people. It is also an important part of the economy, with many jobs depending on it. It is also very difficult to make alcohol illegal, as it is very easy to make and would simply be made illegally. The arguments against making alcohol illegal are that it is a dangerous substance that causes a lot of harm, and that it would be better if it was not available. However, it is also very difficult to make alcohol illegal, and it would be very difficult to enforce. It is also very easy to make alcohol, and it would be very difficult to stop people making it. The best way to deal with alcohol is to educate people about the dangers of alcohol, and to make it as difficult as possible to buy alcohol.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is highly unlikely that alcohol will ever be made illegal in the UK, for many reasons. The UK government is well aware that alcohol sales generate a huge amount of tax revenue, which the government cannot afford to give up. Also, the revenue generated from sales would be very hard to replace, the only option would be to increase taxes in other areas which would be unpopular with the general public. In addition, alcohol is a huge industry in the UK, employing a vast number of people, which is also important to the economy. If alcohol was to be made illegal, this would cause a massive increase in unemployment. Another major reason alcohol will never be made illegal in the UK is the fact that it is deeply ingrained in the British culture and way of life. Alcohol is a part of many people's lives, from their youth onwards. For example, many teenagers go to pubs with their parents, or have alcohol bought for them on their birthday. As a result, it is seen as socially acceptable for people of all ages to consume alcohol.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, alcohol should not be made illegal. This is because it is part of the culture in many countries, and the harm caused by alcohol is far outweighed by the benefits of having it legal. The harm caused by alcohol can be reduced through education and awareness, and the legal system is equipped to deal with the harm caused by alcohol. The legal system can also be used to punish those who cause harm through alcohol.
