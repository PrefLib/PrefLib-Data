# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, the group of participants is in favour of building a new nuclear power station. The new nuclear power station will help to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and will help to combat climate change. Nuclear power is the cleanest and safest source of energy currently available to us and will help to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we produce. The new power station will create jobs for people working in the construction and maintenance of the site. The new nuclear power station will help the UK to become a world leader in energy generation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of having a new nuclear power station. They felt that the UK could use new nuclear power stations and that nuclear is currently the safest, cleanest source of power we have. The group also felt that the UK needs to rely upon different energy sources to help with climate change and that nuclear energy is much cleaner to use and is very safe. The group also felt that having nuclear energy means we can decommission some of the old power plants that are inefficient and cause a lot of greenhouse gases.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of a new nuclear power station. It was felt that nuclear power was a cleaner energy source than coal or gas and was the best option currently available. The group felt that a nuclear power station would create jobs and help the economy. However, the group also felt that more research into alternative energy sources was needed. It was felt that nuclear power was not a long term solution and that a new power station should be built as a temporary measure while other sources of energy are developed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should have a new nuclear power station. The world is moving towards cleaner energy, and nuclear is the cleanest and safest source of energy we currently have. While we should be aiming for more green renewable sources, the technology will not be ready to support it for many years. Nuclear energy is much cleaner to use use and is very safe. It will create jobs in the construction and maintenance of the site and for people running the site. Having nuclear energy means we can decommission some of the old power plants that are inefficient and cause a lot of greenhouse gases.
