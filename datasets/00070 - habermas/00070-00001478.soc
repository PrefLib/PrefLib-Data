# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The BBC is a worthwhile public broadcaster. Although the BBC has had scandals in the past, they are working towards improving and remain an important part of broadcasting in the UK. The BBC continues to produce high quality news and documentaries and are generally impartial. They can be somewhat biased to the political party in power but as they have to appease the government for their funding, it is not surprising. It is important that the BBC continue to air a wide variety of content and is available to most people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the BBC is a worthwhile public broadcaster. It is a well-established organisation that provides a wide variety of programmes for the public. It is also impartial in its reporting and balances its debate accordingly. However, the BBC is not a perfect organisation and it is not beyond reproach. It has been subject to a number of scandals in recent years, which has called into question the impartiality of its reporting. It is therefore important that the BBC is subject to scrutiny, both internally and externally, to ensure that it is providing the public with a fair and balanced service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The BBC is a very important public broadcaster and for the foreseeable future, is likely to remain a very important outlet for television in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The BBC is a worthwhile public broadcaster. It provides a variety of programming, from news to entertainment, and has a good reputation for being impartial.
