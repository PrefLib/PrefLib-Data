# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children with special educational needs should generally start school at a later age, although there will be many cases where special needs are relatively minor. There is no reason to believe that extremely young, immature children need to start school at a later age, because generally these will not affect their education, however it is the responsibility of teachers to account for the needs of these students when they arrive in school, particularly with the issue of bullying, and to plan lessons in a way that encourages their learning and development
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the age at which children start school should be uniform across the country. However, there may be some circumstances in which parents could delay their children's start at school. For example, if a child has special educational needs, then they may need to start at a later age. Also, if the child is very young and immature compared to their peers, then they may also need to start at a later age. However, there is the danger that if children start school too young, they can feel less secure in school and may regress in terms of socialisation, compared to their age group. Overall, we came to the view that in general, the age at which children start school should be uniform across the country. However, we acknowledge that there are exceptions to this rule, namely special educational needs, youngness, and immaturity in comparison to their peer group. We have come to the conclusion that if a child is delayed entry because they are considered immature, they will lose out on an extra year of learning, potentially lowering the opportunity for success, both in school and afterwards. For both cases (special educational needs and immaturity in relation to peers), we recommend a trial period in school before committing
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The age at which children start school should be the same across the country, although in some exceptional cases it may be beneficial for parents to delay their child's start at school. An example of when this may be beneficial is when the child has special educational needs, meaning that they are not on the same level as their peer group.  Comment from Member of Centre for Public Engagement in Environmental Science team: Some parents believe their children will miss out on crucial early developmental stages, such as playing and social interaction if they are made to start formal education too early. Their concern may lead to them choosing not to send their children to school. While many parents are doing the best they can to prepare their children for school with initiatives such as antenatal education, could this increase inequalities for other children that are less fortunate and are not afforded this type of preparation? Can anyone think of another way around the problem? Should they delay their start at school for these parents as a result? Would doing so also limit other childrens educational potential? These are some points to take into consideration during our deliberation session, I look forward to hearing other peoples thoughts and views on the issue!
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children's educational careers should be as uniform as possible, so the age at which they start school should be uniform across the country. However, there may be circumstances in which parents could delay their child's start at school. In some cases, this delay would only be by a matter of months. In other cases, the delay could be years. If a child has special educational needs, then they may need to start at a later age, as this is the best thing for them, educationally and socially. A delay in the age of school entry for children with special needs could be between three months and a year, depending on the extent of the needs and the child's rate of development. Also, if the child is very young and immature compared to their peers, then they may also need to start at a later age. If they are able to start at an older age then this should be looked into because it may be the best thing for their development.
