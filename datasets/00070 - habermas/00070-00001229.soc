# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of banning fast food chains from operating near schools. However, there was a strong view that this should not be a blanket ban and that the distance from the school should be taken into account. It was also agreed that this would be more effective if combined with a programme of education for children on the importance of healthy eating.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We are all in agreement that obesity in children is a big issue, and that the most common factor in child obesity is the amount of junk food that children eat. We all agree that a healthy diet for children is essential for them to grow into healthy adults, and that children need to be taught how to make good nutritional choices. We also agree that one of the biggest causes of children not eating healthy meals is the fact that fast food restaurants are all around, making it easy and convenient to get fast food instead of healthy meals. However, while we agree that banning fast food restaurants from operating near schools is a good idea, we feel that the focus should be on educating children about the long-term health implications of junk food, and to make healthier food options readily available to children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of banning fast food chains from operating near schools. The general consensus was that this would help reduce childhood obesity and also help children develop good dietary habits from a young age. However, the group also recognised that this could have a negative impact on people's livelihoods.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Fast food restaurants should not be allowed to operate within a two-mile radius of any school. The reason is that, while we do believe in personal freedom, the human brain is not fully developed until the mid-twenties. This means that children do not have the impulse control that adults do, thus they are more likely to choose fast food than a healthy option. Furthermore, fast food restaurants use psychological triggers such as the colour red and pictures of meat to get the attention of customers and induce hunger.
