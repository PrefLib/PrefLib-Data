# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, we do not think that it is a good idea to get rid of compulsory education for children because it is important that all children receive education and there will be a significant disadvantage to society if this is not the case.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the conclusion that compulsory education for children should remain in place. Education is the basis for all knowledge and the betterment of society. Therefore it is necessary that all children receive education. If compulsory education is to be maintained the government should also offer support and free education to ensure that no children are left out. The final consensus statement was arrived at by looking at the pros and cons of each participant's opinions, and by looking at the strengths and weaknesses of the draft consensus statement.
