# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, parents should not be able to buy their children cigarettes. Cigarettes are a harmful product which can cause serious health issues. This can affect children's development and lead to an early death. Children are not old enough to make their own decisions about whether to smoke or not and so it is the responsibility of parents to look after their children and protect them from cigarettes. By keeping a firm line against parents buying cigarettes for kids you help parents who may struggle to say "no" to their children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, parents should not be able to buy cigarettes for their children. The health implications for children are dire and parents should be doing everything they can to discourage their children from smoking. The effects of smoking on children can be detrimental to their health and development. The consensus view of the group was that this issue is not black and white, but that the health implications for children of smoking cigarettes are severe. The group agreed that parents should be encouraged to act in the best interests of their children and that this includes discouraging them from smoking cigarettes. The group felt that by making it illegal for parents to buy cigarettes for their children, this will help parents who may struggle to say "no" to their children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, parents should not be able to buy their children cigarettes. Children under 18 are not mature enough to make their own decisions and therefore parents should not be able to buy cigarettes for their children. It is the parents responsibility to care for their children and cigarettes are damaging to a child's health. Buying cigarettes for children will also lead to the children being addicted to cigarettes. The effects of cigarettes on a child's health can be very serious. Buying cigarettes for children will also lead to an increase in the number of children who smoke, which will have a detrimental effect on their health and wellbeing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, parents should not be able to buy their children cigarettes. We have a duty of care to protect our children and cigarettes have a detrimental effect on their health. We should be discouraging the use of cigarettes in society and this will not help. We also need to protect the NHS from the burden of the health implications of smoking.
