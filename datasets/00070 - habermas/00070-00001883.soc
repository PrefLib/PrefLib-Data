# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should ban single-use plastic bottles. Plastic bottles have many recyclable properties, and we should use these as in all packaging. The group felt that it was very important to make the distinction between single-use plastics and other plastics. The group felt that it was important to emphasise that single-use plastics were very harmful to the environment, and get into our seas and rivers killing sea creatures, as well as being littered and hurting wildlife on land. The group felt that it was important to point out that single-use plastics take many years to break up naturally. The group felt that it was important to point out that there were many other options available now such as reusable water bottles. The group felt that it was important to point out that people had greatly adapted their ways of buying drinks with most people taking their own reusable water bottle with the wherever they go. The group felt that it was important to point out that to get the rest of the population to follow we need to remove the option to buy them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: Single-use plastics are a blight to our planet. Single-use plastics serve no purpose than to be a vessel for products which either need protection or to retain their 'freshness'; this could be achieved a multitude of different ways, such as encouraging our society to return to purchasing from local suppliers. By using single-use plastics our society does not think of the consequences of their actions, such as the plastic bottles that get littered around and harm wildlife, or get into the sea and kill sea-creatures. By using single-use plastics we are responsible for the deaths of over 100 million marine animals every year, and the death of a million seabirds. Single-use plastics take many years to break up naturally so they cause tremendous harm to the environment. Due to advances in recycling technology, we can now recycle most plastics and there are many ways to avoid the use of single-use plastics; recyclable plastic bottles, tins of water, cardboard cartons and reusable bottles are all readily available. Single-use plastics should be discouraged in society so we can protect the environment that we live on.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should ban single-use plastic bottles, as these are not useful for the environment and take many years to break up naturally.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Single-use plastics are a blight to our planet. They serve no purpose than to be a vessel for products which either need protection or to retain their 'freshness'; this could be achieved a multitude of different ways, such as encouraging our society to return to purchasing from local suppliers. Single-use plastics cause a great amount of harm to the environment, and get into our seas and rivers killing sea creatures, as well as being littered and hurting wildlife on land. With so many other options now available such as reusable water bottles the single use plastic bottle no longer has a use. People have greatly adapted their ways of buying drinks with most people taking their own reusable water bottle with the wherever they go. To get the rest of the population to follow we need to remove the option to buy them. Conclusion: The consensus group process clearly delivered a very well-developed opinion, taking into account all the different viewpoints. The final consensus opinion is much more developed than the initial draft, with further elaboration and supporting evidence. It is clear that the consensus group process delivered a very well-developed opinion, taking into account all the different viewpoints.
