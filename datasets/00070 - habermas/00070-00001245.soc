# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, we believe that the UN is a good thing and that it is good to help poor countries. However, there are a lot of countries that are struggling to feed their population.  We should make sure that nobody goes hungry.  The UN should make sure that the aid goes to the people who need it most.  We should help poor countries by assisting them with financial assistance.  The contribution can be made using the amount of tax that is deducted each month from the tax-payers.  This would significantly help them with basic opportunities like housing, proper nutrition and basic education.   However, some people believe we should first make sure that everyone in our own country is receiving a decent living standard. I may be selfish, but charity begins at home.

This would significantly help them with basic opportunities like housing, proper nutrition and basic education.  However, we feel that we should address our own domestic financial concerns first.  It's not justifiable to see our own homeless people and poorer people struggling in our country but send huge amounts of money off to foreign countries.  We feel that it would be more useful to spend the money on our own people first.  We need to be responsible for our own people first, before we start looking after other countries.  Charity begins at home.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There are a lot of countries that are struggling to feed their population.  We should make sure that nobody goes hungry.  The UN should make sure that the aid goes to the people who need it most.  In a financially stable economic situation, yes we  should, but at present our own financial problems need to be addressed.  It's not justifiable to see our own homeless people and poorer people struggling in our country but send huge amounts of money off to foreign countries.  I may be selfish, but charity begins at home.

They believe it is important to help our own country before helping others.  This project was designed by Genevieve Morrow, Genevieve Ferguson and Alicia Berrie.
