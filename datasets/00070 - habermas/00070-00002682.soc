# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the UK should not change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country. However, there are some circumstances where it is appropriate to change the policy to allow a small number of individuals into the country.  This is especially the case where individuals are fleeing from war-torn countries or where they are seeking to escape persecution.  In these cases, it is important that the UK continues to play its part in providing a safe haven for people in need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the UK should not change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country.  However, we recognise that there are some people who have a genuine need to seek asylum in the UK and that the UK should continue to offer a safe haven to such people.  We also recognise that the current asylum seeking system is not working as well as it could and that there is scope for reform.  We would like to see a system that is fair, efficient and humane.  This would include a system that is able to distinguish between genuine asylum seekers and economic migrants.  We would also like to see a system that is able to process asylum seekers in a timely manner, so that genuine asylum seekers are not left in limbo for many years.  Finally, we would like to see a system that is able to offer asylum seekers the support they need to integrate into UK society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK should reform its asylum seeking policy but not to make it easier to enter the country.  Genuine asylum seeking individuals whilst having the opportunity to enter the UK and ultimately benefit UK society and themselves must be processed in an appropriate manner in order for abuse of the system not to occur. Our infrastructure cannot cope with en masse immigration however the UK will always benefit from experience of individuals from other nations
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should not change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country.  However, the UK should be open to asylum seekers who are genuinely in need of asylum and have a legitimate claim.  The UK should also provide support to other countries in the EU to help them deal with the asylum seeking crisis.  The UK should also work with the EU to provide more support to countries outside of the EU, which are the source of many asylum seekers.
