# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the UK should not implement policies that lead to a population increase. There is no consensus on this topic as there are two opposing views. The following conclusions were reached during the course of the debate: * It was a point of contention whether the UK currently has a population decrease * The effect of Brexit on immigration was debated at length * There were some opposing views on the way that immigration should be addressed * It was debated whether the UK's infrastructure can sustain a population increase * A proposal that the UK should use foreign investment to improve infrastructure and attract a greater population
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be policies that are related to population increase. However, there should not be any policies that will directly increase the population. We should not increase the population of the UK. The government should introduce policies that will make it easier to have children (e.g. free school lunches for all) but there should be no policies that will force people to have children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was wary of implementing any policy, which led to an increase in the UK's population. This was largely because of the UK's socio-economic climate, which is largely still recovering from the 2008 recession. The UK is currently experiencing a housing shortage, and this issue has not yet been solved, despite the country being home to a population of approximately 64 million. The debate was largely focused on how any policy would affect the UK's current socio-economic climate, and most felt that implementing a policy that lead to an increase in the population was not advisable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Policies leading to a population increase should be implemented to help keep the economy healthy in the UK, and to also help increase the number of people that can work. However, before policies are implemented, it is important to fix current issues with the country, such as poverty, and the housing crisis, as these would impact any policies implemented negatively. Also, it is important to help new mothers/fathers with work-life balance, as this would encourage more people to start a family, and increase the population.
