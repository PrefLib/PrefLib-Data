# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No. The national lottery is already in place and has been for years. It is a form of gambling and is not a good way to solve the country's financial problems. It is also a tax on the poor. The government should be able to find better ways to solve Britain's problems, after thoroughly analysing and researching the issue.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of a national lottery. The group felt that a national lottery would not help solve Britain's financial problems. The group felt that a national lottery would only encourage people to spend money they don't have, in the hope of winning. The group felt that a national lottery would only cause people to go into debt. The group felt that the government should be able to find better ways to solve Britain's problems, after thoroughly analysing and researching the issue. The group felt that the super rich should be taxed more to help financial issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We feel that a lottery does not really help to solve Britain's financial problems. In fact it may actually cause more problems, as people may go into debt to participate in the lottery and people may get addicted to the lottery and spend a lot of money. We also feel that the government should look for better ways to solve Britain's problems and try to analyse the current financial situation thoroughly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although a national lottery would be a great idea, it would not solve Britain’s financial problems. This is because, in theory, it would simply take money from one section of the population to give it to another. Britain would still be in financial trouble, but perhaps less so. There would be the added bonus of a small number of people being able to change their life and help solve their financial problems. However, that would only be a very small number of people, so the lottery would only be a small part of the solution. A better solution to Britain’s financial problems is to cut back on benefits, particularly those which are handed out to people who don’t work. At the moment, too much money is being given to people who don’t need it, and people who do need it are getting nothing. The government should take the money that would have been given to these people, and use it to solve Britain’s financial problems.
