# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of stricter gun control. This was because there is a strong link between the number of guns in a country and the number of gun deaths in that country. The group also felt that the US has a very relaxed attitude to guns and that this is a major factor in the high number of gun deaths in that country.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Gun control is absolutely needed. The high number of deaths due to gun violence in America and the potential risk to children in schools is horrifying. Stricter gun control is required to ensure safety of individuals. Background checks should be conducted on all gun purchases and additional restrictions should be put in place for the number of guns that can be purchased by a single person.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of stricter gun control. The reasons for this included that the US has the highest gun ownership and gun death rates in the world. It was felt that the US should follow the example of other countries such as the UK and Ireland where guns are much harder to obtain. It was felt that there should be a psych evaluation for anyone who wants to own a gun to ensure that they are not a danger to themselves or others. It was felt that there should be a licence to carry a gun and that there should be training to show that the person can use the gun. It was felt that the local authority should be notified of anyone who wants to own a gun. It was felt that the person who owns the gun should be subject to regular checks. It was felt that the use of guns should not be a recreational thing and that shooting ranges should only be available to people who need to learn to shoot for their job. It was felt that guns are a weapon and can cause death and to view them in a recreational light is a bad thing. It was felt that access to guns should be tightened and restricted to this whoo need them for a legitimate reason.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that stricter gun control laws are needed, the US has one of the highest gun ownership and gun death rates in the world. This is down to the ease at which guns can be purchased and we believe this needs to change. There are a number of things we feel need to be implemented.  First and foremost, there should be a licence and training requirement for any individual who wants to own a gun. They should also have to do a psych evaluation to show that they can handle the weapon appropriately and to show that they have a valid reason for owning the gun. In the US, there is currently a great laxity in laws around gun ownership and as a result this has allowed the situation to deteriorate to its current state. The same can be said for the UK and we feel that gun ownership should be limited to those who have a legitimate need for them and the purchase of a gun should not be a quick and easy process.  Lastly, we believe there should be serious consequences for the inappropriate use of a gun. We have seen many incidents in which a person who has killed someone has been able to get off because of their defence of self or property. We believe that if a person kills another
