# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - A new regulatory framework should be established to ensure that fracking can only take place under strict conditions that protect the environment and ensure that local communities are properly consulted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although fracking can provide economic benefits, the risks of environmental and societal damage are too great for it to be allowed to operate in the current regulatory framework. A new framework must be established which takes into account the needs of the local communities affected, as well as ensuring that fracking is done in a way that minimises harm to the environment and our natural resources.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a new regulatory framework for fracking. The current regulatory framework is ineffective and too relaxed. There is too much concern for the industry and not enough for the environment and the community. Fracking is detrimental to the environment and the communities surrounding fracking operations. The new regulatory framework would focus on making fracking as sustainable as possible. This would involve encouraging the use of alternative energy sources as much as possible. Fracking operations would only be allowed to occur when there is no other option. Additionally, any fracking operations would have to have the consent of the local community. Any adverse effects on the local community would result in the cancellation of the fracking operations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to fracking. All agreed that it should not be allowed to continue, and there should be no new operations set up. In order to mitigate any damage that might be caused by existing fracking operations, and prevent any future ones from starting, it was agreed that a new regulatory framework should be established. This would be for the purpose of ensuring that the industry was not allowed complete freedom to set up operations wherever and whenever it wanted. The regulations would take into account local conditions, such as the desire for employment opportunities, as well as environmental objections. Additionally, it would ensure that fracking operations would not run counter to the government's approach to reducing dependency on fossil fuels, in order to protect the climate and mitigate against further global warming. A new framework should also ensure that fracking operations would be run as responsibly as possible, in order to protect the environment and ensure the safety of local communities.
