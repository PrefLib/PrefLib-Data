# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We need to find ways of making the healthy choice the easy choice. We should look at all ways of doing this including taxation, regulation, and education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We don't need a sugar tax because it is not going to make much of a difference, it is more up to the individual to decide what they want to eat and drink. It is not fair to tax people on what they want to eat and drink, it is their choice and it should be up to them to decide if they want to buy the product or not. If the tax is going to be used to fund campaigns to educate people on the dangers of sugar, then I think it is a good idea but it shouldn't be used to tax people on what they want to buy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, because it is too much of a blunt instrument. There is more to health than sugar and it is not an effective way to tackle the root causes of ill health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: A sugar tax is a blunt instrument and we should be looking to address the underlying causes of ill health.
