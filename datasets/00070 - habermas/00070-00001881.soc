# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, we would all be better off if we reduced our use of fossil fuels.  However, some fossil fuels are a necessary part of modern society.  We should also try to reduce our use of fossil fuels that produce the most pollution.  But, as we have developed technology to use fossil fuels in a cleaner way, we should use this technology.  Also, in places like China, where there is an increasing demand for fossil fuels, it is essential that we continue to use fossil fuels until we can find alternative sources of energy that are readily available and easy to use.  But, we should also take into consideration that developing countries may need help.  We also need to take responsibility for our past actions, which have caused damage to the earth.  This means that we should not only reduce our use of fossil fuels, but also our consumption of any product which has been made by the use of fossil fuels.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of reducing our use of fossil fuels, but recognised that this may not be the best course of action for developing countries who are still trying to develop their economies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Yes, we would all be better off if we reduced our use of fossil fuels.  Fossil fuels are a finite resource and so we will run out one day.  Fossil fuels are also bad for us and our environment and we must do all we can to move towards more green energy.  In the long run, green energy will also benefit us all financially as fossil fuels are currently causing a great deal of stress and uncertainty for most people and what they can afford.  We must also respect that developing countries may need help.  In Victorian Britain, our use of fossil fuels helped the Industrial revolution, and we were totally ignorant of the impact on our planet.  Now we know the damage it causes, but we cannot expect poorer countries, who may have access to cheap fossil fuel, to just change without help.”
