# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Mass immigration is a tricky topic. In principle, we agree that it is a good thing to allow people to move to countries where they can have a better life. However, there are some caveats. The host country needs to be able to provide for all its citizens, including immigrants. It is also important to ensure that the immigrants are coming for the right reasons. For example, we do not think it is a good idea to allow human traffickers to continue to grow their business. We also think that it is important to ensure that the immigrants are not coming from places where their life is already good enough. If the immigrants are coming from places where they are already living a good life, they may not be coming for the right reasons. We also think that it is important to ensure that the immigrants do not come from places where they are likely to have different moral values to the host country. This can lead to social tensions and in some cases, violence.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In principle, we agree that legal migration is acceptable and in fact, immigration has historically led to the enrichment of cultures and contributed to the wellbeing of countries and their populations. However, we also agree that there are several factors that need to be taken into consideration before accepting mass immigration of people from dissimilar cultural backgrounds.  Firstly, the capacity of a country to accommodate the influx of people without compromising the quality of life of its own population.  Secondly, the effects of the sudden introduction of a large group of people with cultural, religious and/or political values that are not acceptable or even outlawed by the host country.  Thirdly, whether these groups of people will have the skills to integrate and contribute to the economy or not.  Lastly, whether these groups of people are arriving in the country to fill a niche or will they add to an already existing demographic overpopulation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that there should be a set amount of people allowed into a country on a yearly basis. This would help to regulate the growth of the population and would make it easier for the government to monitor and manage. The group believes that this would also help to stop mass immigration because the word mass suggests that the number of people would be large. Also, it would help to stop overcrowding of a country and would help to ensure that the immigrants that do get into the country would be able to fit in and contribute to the economy. The group believes that we should encourage immigration as long as the immigrants will be able to contribute to the economy and make the country a better place to live.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In principle, the group was in favour of immigration. The devil is in the detail, and the group felt that the word mass was the problem. The group felt that there needs to be the ability to care for everyone in the country whether they are born there or immigrate to it. If a country cannot provide for everyone within its borders, it is irresponsible to continue to allow unhindered immigration. The quality of life of everyone in the country needs to be considered and access to necessities such as housing, healthcare and education for all the population need to be addressed and a strategy in place. Allowing unlimited numbers to add to the population of a country, if you cannot provide for their basic needs is not helpful. If people come to this country under the impression they can be cared for and then find themselves in dire circumstances it is not fair. If people are coming to this country illegally, this is a different matter and the group felt that this is not the way to help improve people's lives. It is not necessarily an issue of the people that are coming here, but more of a case of the fact that it helps to fund human rights violators and their ability to make a profit out of people who are seeking a better
