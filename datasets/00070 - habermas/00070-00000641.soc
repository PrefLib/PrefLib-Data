# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - A national register of the genetic codes of all the population is a step too far. The government should not mandate things like this on the population and people should always have a say on these kind of things. We should not be making it easier to discriminate against people, especially on the basis of their ethnicity. We should not be making it easier to discriminate against people, especially on the basis of their ethnicity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, we do not believe that there should be a national register of the genetic codes of all the population. This is because of the privacy issues and the possible discrimination that this may lead to. It is also because of the legal issues that this may cause if the codes are unreliable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a national register of the genetic codes of all the population, but only if it is made clear to the population what the register will be used for and if the register is used for this purpose only.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a national register of the genetic codes of all the population, but this should be voluntary. Anybody who wants to register their genetic code should be allowed to do so and they should be allowed to withdraw their information at any time. The genetic code information should be stored securely, and the government should appoint a body to govern access to the data.
