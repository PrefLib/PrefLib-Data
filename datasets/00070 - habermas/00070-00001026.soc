# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is fair for the government to provide subsidies for solar panels on people's homes, even if they are the most expensive option. The participants felt that the use of solar panels would help to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and would help to reduce the effects of climate change. The participants felt that the installation of solar panels on peoples homes would make use of existing buildings and would be a good use of resources. The participants felt that many people would not be able to afford solar panels on their own and it would not be fair for hard working tax payers to be left behind.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the government providing subsidies for solar panels on people's homes. The group felt that solar panels are a good way of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and reducing our impact on the environment. The group also felt that it is important to make this transition as quickly as possible and that the government should be providing subsidies to encourage this. The group did however acknowledge that there are some people who will not be able to afford solar panels and that it is not fair that they are left behind. The group felt that the government should be looking at other ways to encourage the use of renewable energy and that it should be looking at ways to make solar panels more affordable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the government providing subsidies for solar panels on people's homes. The group was in favour of this because it would help reduce climate change and would help the country transition away from fossil fuels. The group felt that this would be a good option because it would be affordable for the government and would make use of existing buildings. The group felt that it would be fair to provide subsidies for solar panels on people's homes as this would help reduce climate change. The group felt that this would be fair as it would help people who couldn't afford to pay for the solar panels themselves. The group felt that it would be fair to provide subsidies for solar panels on people's homes as it would help reduce climate change and this would be good for the whole country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the government providing subsidies for solar panels on people's homes. This is because the use of solar panels is a good way to help the planet by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Some people may not be able to afford solar panels, but the government should provide subsidies to help these people as well. The group also thought that solar panels could increase the value of a home, which could be an incentive for people to install them.
