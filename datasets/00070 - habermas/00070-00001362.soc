# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is not okay to own any animal as a pet if you live in a small apartment and are at work all day. There are too many negative effects of this to list. This statement has been reached after taking into account a few factors. The animal is probably being left alone for a long period of time which can make the animal very lonely and cause anxiety. They may also become destructive and aggressive which can cause damage to your home. It can also be dangerous for your animal if there is an accident or a fire in your home. An animal needs attention and it is not right to keep it just for your own pleasure and then leave it alone when it is not convenient. It is also very cruel to keep an animal in a confined space.
