# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, it should not be legal for someone to sell their own body organs. If it is legal, people will be exploited and will be pressured to sell their organs. This will also lead to a black market for organs. The rich will be able to buy their way to health while the poor will be left to die.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although theoretically the notion of organ selling could be encouraged to mitigate the organ shortages necessary for transplants, the potential risk of exploitation and abuse is far too high to justify legalisation. As there are already many organs donated for transplants without charge, it is unnecessary and unethical to allow a black market for organs to flourish. There is also an argument that it is necessary to prohibit organ selling because of the unique nature of organs, which cannot be replicated and their loss may affect the well-being of the body.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Selling organs is a tough issue to get right. On the one hand, there is the need to respect a person’s right to use their own body as they wish. The philosophical justification is the sanctity of individual freedom. The pragmatic argument is that selling one’s own organs would alleviate the shortage of organs, leading to reduced waiting lists and saving more lives. There are those who might argue that this is simply a question of supply and demand. On the other hand, there is the argument that individuals will be vulnerable to coercion and pressure, potentially losing their most vital organs for the sake of a few dollars. Moreover, the rich will be able to buy organs from the poor, thus allowing their lives to be saved while the poor are left to die. This means that justice and equality would be lost.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the sale of body organs should be legal. It is a way to mitigate the harm of organ shortages, necessary for transplants. By permitting selling organs, more lives can be saved, and waiting lists can be reduced. Regulating the market would ensure safety and protect illegal organ trafficking. Moreover, it gives individuals their constitutional freedoms to make decisions about their bodies and use the proceeds to support their lives and fulfill their needs. Additionally, it creates a new industry, leading to economic benefits and employment opportunities. However, it is important to note that the sale of body organs is not a universal solution to organ shortages. The sale of body organs should be legalised only in countries with trusted law systems and medical expertise in place. Also, there should be a strict regulation on the sale of body organs. For example, people who are selling their body organs should be well informed about the risks involved in the process.
