# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - While the reduction of taxation for corporations is a move that might appear to be favourable for companies, it is not actually in the best interests of either them or the economy as a whole. In order for businesses to thrive and for countries to remain economically viable, it is essential that all companies pay the taxes that they owe, which is the case with the current level of tax that is charged on companies. Lowering the level of taxation on corporations will only serve to damage the economy and society as a whole, as companies will feel less need to return to the country from which they originate. This will ultimately cause the economy to stagnate, which will only serve to damage the interests of the entire country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that it is not a good idea to further reduce taxation on corporations. Corporations have a responsibility to pay their fair share of tax to the countries that enable them to make their profits. It is not right that they pay increasingly large amounts to shareholders and that the tax burden is shifted to the individual. We feel that taxation on corporations should be increased, not reduced, in order to help the economy grow.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Corporations should pay their fair share of tax to the country which enables them to make their profits. The rate of taxation should be proportional to the profits made by the corporation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is a good idea to further reduce taxation on corporations.
