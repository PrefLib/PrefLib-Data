# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Young people should be allowed to vote in elections. They should be allowed to vote from the age of 16 as they are considered adults for certain circumstances in law and should be responsible enough for their views to be considered. The voting age should not be lowered to any younger than this as many young people would not bother to vote and would not be informed enough to make an informed decision. It would perhaps be beneficial for younger people to vote in situations that directly impact them too, ie voting about university costs. Young people should be taught about politics in school and given the resources to form their own opinions so they have a strong idea of their values and beliefs by the time they are old enough to vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Young people should be allowed to vote in elections, but they should be of a certain age and should have a certain level of political knowledge.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It was agreed that the voting age should be lowered to 16 and young people should be allowed to vote in elections. This was agreed as it will help young people feel more included and involved with the democratic process and this will mean that the youth voice will be more widely heard and they will be able to express their opinions on issues that affect them. This will also help the political parties gain votes and thus their manifestos will be changed to make them more appealing to younger people. Also, we all felt that the arguments for voting at 16 were more persuasive than the arguments against. The arguments against seemed to be based around the fact that younger people aren’t educated enough about politics or informed enough about political parties and candidates to make an informed decision and that their views and opinions change frequently as they grow up and mature. However, these are things that could be easily resolved through the implementation of politics education in schools, increasing awareness of political parties and candidates and making it compulsory to go to the polling station to vote rather than giving young people the option of abstaining.
