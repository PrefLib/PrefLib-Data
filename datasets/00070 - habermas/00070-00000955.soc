# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that a universal basic income should be given to everyone, however, this income should be very small, just enough to provide a safety net for people in need.  We also believe that those who work should receive a basic income and a salary.  This would help people to provide for themselves and their families.  This would also help to cut down on homelessness and poverty in the country.  However, there should be an "opt-out" process so that those that don't need it have the option to donate it to those in dire need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A universal basic income should be given to everyone, but people who are fit and able to work should also receive a salary for the work they do.  The universal basic income should be enough to ensure that people can live a decent life, and not be forced to take on multiple jobs just to survive.  The universal basic income should be given to everyone, including those who are addicted to drugs, alcohol, smoking, gambling, etc. as this would be the only way to ensure that they are not forced to resort to crime in order to survive.  There should also be an "opt-out" process for those who do not need the basic income and would prefer to donate it to those in dire need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of a universal basic income for everyone.  The group believed that a universal basic income would provide a safety net for people and families in times of need.  The group also believed that a universal basic income would reduce poverty and homelessness in the country and provide people with a basic standard of living.  The group also believed that a universal basic income would allow people to follow their passions and take the risk of setting up their own business.  The group believed that a universal basic income would be a positive thing for the economy and would provide people with a peace of mind.  The group also believed that a universal basic income would be good for people's mental health and would reduce the amount of stress in people's lives.  The group believed that a universal basic income would allow people to follow their passions and provide people with the opportunity to be creative.  The group also believed that a universal basic income would provide people with a safety net in times of recession and would help people to survive in times of need.  The group believed that a universal basic income would be a positive thing for society and would be a step in the right direction.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a universal basic income for everyone, but there should also be a system in place to ensure that people who are able to work, are working and are not living off the state.  This universal income should be used to help people who are struggling to get by and should be used to help those who are homeless or in poverty.  This would be a huge help to many people who are currently struggling.  This universal income would also act as a safety net for people in times of recession or when they are out of work.  This would also help to reduce the amount of homelessness and poverty in the country and would help to make the country a better place to live.
