# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we do not believe that companies should be allowed to pay employees less than minimum wage as long as the company provides them with subsidized meals and housing. We believe that the current minimum wage is not enough to live off of in the first place and should be raised. If it is not raised then it is not fair to the employees to not be paid the minimum wage and be expected to live off of the food and housing that the company provides.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we do not think that companies should be allowed to pay employees less than minimum wage as long as the company provides them with subsidized meals and housing. We believe that the minimum wage is there to protect employees from exploitation. We believe that if a company cannot afford to pay a minimum wage, they should not be in business. We also believe that the idea of subsidised meals and housing is a good idea, but the company should subsidise this for all employees, not just those who are receiving a lower wage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that it is acceptable for companies to pay employees less than minimum wage as long as the company provides them with subsidized meals and housing. The meals and housing must be of a good quality and the employee must be made aware of the costs of meals and housing. This must be made clear in the employee contract and must be something that the employee is happy with. The employee must also be made aware that they can leave the job at any time and they will not be charged for meals and housing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, companies should not be allowed to pay employees less than minimum wage as long as the company provides them with subsidized meals and housing. There is a very real possibility that a company would take advantage of employees and not provide adequate meals and housing. The consensus view is that this is a very bad idea.
