# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Advertising alcohol should be more responsible. The health risks of alcohol abuse and addiction should be emphasised, and information should be provided about the danger of mixing alcohol and driving, so that young adults are made more aware of the dangers involved. Advertisements that glamorise alcohol abuse, or make light of alcoholism, should not be allowed. Given the damage that alcohol abuse can cause, alcohol should not be advertised on TV during the early evening and early morning when children and young adults are watching television. Although there is a strong drinking culture in Britain and alcohol is sold almost everywhere, and that young adults, particularly teenagers, are exposed to it constantly, advertising should not act as a reminder to drink. Advertising must not be used to seduce young adults into drinking irresponsibly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of advertising alcohol, but with some caveats. It was felt that advertising alcohol should be more responsible, with warnings and information about the dangers of alcohol abuse and addiction. The group felt that this would help to reduce alcohol abuse, and also help to educate people about the dangers of alcohol. The group also felt that the advertising of alcohol should be more tightly regulated, to ensure that it is not being advertised in a way that is encouraging people to drink irresponsibly. The group also suggested that there should be more responsibility on the part of alcohol retailers, to ensure they are not selling alcohol to people who are drunk or below the legal age. The group said that alcohol manufacturers should also do more to reduce alcohol addiction, with the use of warning labels on alcohol products and ensuring that they are not marketing to people who have addictive tendencies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of advertising alcohol, but with some caveats. It was felt that advertising alcohol should be more responsible, with warnings and information about the dangers of alcohol abuse and addiction. The group felt that this would help to reduce alcohol abuse, and also help to educate people about the dangers of alcohol. The group also felt that the advertising of alcohol should be more tightly regulated, to ensure that it is not being advertised in a way that is encouraging people to drink irresponsibly. The group also felt that it should be more tightly regulated in terms of when and where it is advertised, to make sure that it is not being advertised to people who are not of legal drinking age, or to people who suffer from alcoholism, or who are vulnerable to alcohol addiction.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group was in favour of advertising alcohol, but with some caveats. It was felt that advertising alcohol should be more responsible, with warnings and information about the dangers of alcohol abuse and addiction. The group felt that this would help to reduce alcohol abuse, and also help to educate people about the dangers of alcohol. The group also felt that the advertising of alcohol should be more tightly regulated, to ensure that it is not being advertised in a way that is encouraging people to drink irresponsibly. The group was also in favour of advertising alcohol in a more limited fashion, to reduce the amount of alcohol advertising that young people are exposed to, which is a cause for concern for many people.
