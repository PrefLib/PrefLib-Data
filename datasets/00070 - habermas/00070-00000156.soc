# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Sex work should not be criminalised. Sex work is a service provided in exchange for money and as long as it is between consenting adults then it should not be criminalised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Sex work should not be criminalised as it provides income for people who would otherwise struggle to find work. Though a lot of people find the work distasteful, it is still a means of income and a service being provided in exchange for money. Anyone is free to choose what they do for work and sex work is no different.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The practice of sex work should not be criminalised as it provides an income for people who would otherwise struggle to find work. Though a lot of people find the work distasteful, it is still a means of income and a service being provided in exchange for money. Anyone is free to choose what they do for work and sex work is no different. However, it should be regulated to ensure the safety of the sex workers, and to ensure that the sex workers are not being exploited.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Sex work should not be criminalised. The work should be able to be conducted in a safe and legal manner, and the workers should have the same rights as any other employee. They should also be allowed to organise in unions and be able to form relationships with their colleagues, and work in a safe environment.
