# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We don't think that the UK needs a minimum price for alcohol, as we believe that the price is already high enough and that the price would only be raised to an extent that would be unfair to the consumer. Instead, we believe that the government should be focusing on the health and safety of the consumer, and that they should be focusing on the retailers and sellers of alcohol, as this is where the problem lies. We also believe that the sellers of alcohol should be more heavily fined if they are caught selling to underage children, as this is where the problem lies. We also believe that the government should be doing more to provide health and safety information to the consumer, and that they should be doing more to provide rehabilitation services to those who have a problem with alcoholism.
