# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The sale of alcohol should be controlled, but not banned. Alcohol is often seen as a problem but people must take responsibility for their own actions. There are currently laws surrounding alcohol to ensure that people are not over served and should be educated enough to know their limits and how much is too much. We do not think that the sale of alcohol should be banned, but rather it should be regulated and be made illegal to sell to those who are already intoxicated. We do not think that banning the sale of alcohol will have any affect on people's behaviour, but rather their own self control. We do not think that there will be a black market for alcohol, as if the sale of alcohol is banned there will be more people that want to sell it on the black market. However, there will be more people trying to buy it on the black market, therefore creating more problems. It is better to regulate alcohol than ban it, as it is such a part of society. We believe that people are responsible enough to regulate themselves and they should not be told what they can and cannot drink.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The sale of alcohol should not be banned. Alcohol should not be banned because the revenue raised from its sale is significant, and because the sale of alcohol already has strong regulations which prevent the sale of alcohol to under-age or intoxicated people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The sale of alcohol should not be banned. There is a high level of public support for alcohol and we do not think it would be wise to attempt to ban it. We think that the regulations around the sale of alcohol are strong enough. We think that any attempt to ban alcohol would be met with strong public opposition and would also lead to the growth of a black market in alcohol. We think that this would lead to the growth of organised crime and would also lead to the growth of disorder in our communities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, the sale of alcohol should not be banned. The legal sale of alcohol is a significant source of revenue for the government and banning it would cause a black market for alcohol to develop, leading to other problems. The current regulations and laws around the sale of alcohol are sufficient to ensure that it is sold responsibly.
