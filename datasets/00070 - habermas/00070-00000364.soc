# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although single-use containers are a problem for the environment, we do not feel that they should be completely banned, as they provide an easy and convenient method of storing and transporting snacks. Instead, we would like to see an increased effort being made to encourage their recycling, and the use of biodegradable materials in their manufacture. We would also like to see an effort made by the government to encourage the use of multi-use containers for those who are able to use them, and perhaps introduce incentives for recycling and re-use of single-use containers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We agree that single-use containers should be reduced, but we do not think they should be completely banned. Instead, they should be manufactured from biodegradable materials and efforts should be made to encourage individuals to recycle them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although single-use containers are a problem for the environment, we do not feel that they should be completely banned, as they provide an easy and convenient method of storing and transporting snacks. However, the government should make an increased effort to discourage their use, and encourage people to reuse containers, and/or to recycle the containers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Single-use containers are a problem for the environment. The government and companies should encourage their recycling and discourage the use of single-use containers in their manufacture. They should also encourage those who can to use reusable containers instead of buying single-use containers.
