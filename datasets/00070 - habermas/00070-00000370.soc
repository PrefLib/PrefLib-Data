# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Trade is a good thing for the world, and generally trade barriers should be avoided. Trade is something that can benefit all parties and allow for all economies to grow and become stronger. On the other hand, we can't completely ignore the negative effects that global trade can have on a nation's economy, so we must also be willing to provide support to local industries in times of need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the free movement of goods and services in a global market is better than not having such free movement. Free trade creates more wealth and more opportunities for individuals and nations, which in turn creates more freedom and better overall living standards. The free movement of people in the world is also important, but is not something that will be discussed here.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The world is a better place with free trade. It allows countries to compete on a fair level and people to access the cheapest prices.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, we believe that free trade does indeed make the world a better place because it results in a fairer system. Prices get cheaper for consumers and aren't controlled in an artificial way. People get access to a wider range of products, and also get access to cheaper products when there are less monopolies. Free trade makes the world a better place because the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. This makes the world a better place because the poorer countries can learn from the richer countries and try to adopt their ways and succeed, which will then hopefully make the world an even better place.
