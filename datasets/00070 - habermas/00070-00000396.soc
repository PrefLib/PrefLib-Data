# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should adopt a universal basic income policy as it will protect those from being exploited, increase consumer spending and reduce homelessness in the UK. There should be regulations in place to ensure the system isn't abused.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that a trial of universal basic income would be a great idea, although we are unsure as to whether the concept can be effectively managed and administered at this point. We believe that there are many practical issues with the policy, such as the requirement to keep an accurate and up to date register of the entire population of the UK, as well as the requirement to track the movement of all individuals on the register.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We think that the UBI is an interesting concept but there are better ways of helping people in need such as support for those unable to work or support for people in low paying jobs. The opinion of one person about the UBI “It’s about helping people that are disadvantaged. If we all lived in a big mansion, we would have a universal income, and we would all be equal, we wouldn’t need it. It is about raising the floor, it’s not about raising the ceiling.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - A universal basic income is a form of welfare that is paid to all members of a society, regardless of their income or employment status. It could be beneficial for society in a number of ways, but only if implemented correctly. It could prevent many people from falling into poverty, reduce the number of homeless people and could increase consumer spending. This would also benefit the local economy as more money would be circulated around local businesses. On the other hand, a universal basic income could lead to people taking advantage of the system, spending their welfare on things that aren't necessary. It is vital that the system isn't abused. A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
