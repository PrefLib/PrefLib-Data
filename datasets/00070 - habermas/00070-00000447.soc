# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK's National Health Service (NHS) was a very good health system when it was first introduced, but it is not up to the standards it once was and is becoming more and more problematic. The problem is with the under-funding and lack of staff, making it very hard to provide the best health service. This has also caused many doctors and nurses to go and work abroad for more money. This is a shame as the NHS used to be one of the best health services in the world. However, the UK government has not been spending enough money on the NHS in recent years and the NHS has become very overstretched. We all agreed that the NHS is a very good service, but it is not the best health system in the world.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK's National Health Service (NHS) is a brilliant health system but is falling behind the standards of the past due to the government not funding it sufficiently, causing doctors and nurses to move abroad. This is a shame as the NHS used to be one of the best health services in the world. However, the UK government has not been spending enough money on the NHS in recent years and the NHS has become very overstretched. We all agreed that the NHS is a very good service, but it is not the best health system in the world. (Note: This is an actual real-life example from one of the groups involved in the pilot test of the new consensus method).
