# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The maximum legal speed for cars should not be lowered from 70mph to 60mph. This is because most people drive at 70mph on motorways anyway, and lowering the speed limit would just encourage people to speed and cause more accidents. Also, lowering the speed limit would mean that people would take longer to get to their destination, and this is not practical or necessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the maximum legal speed for cars should not be lowered from 70mph to 60mph. The maximum legal speed for cars has been set at 70mph for many years now and is not only suitable, but necessary for the majority of people who need to travel to work or school. By lowering the speed limit, you are more likely to have drivers who wish to get to their destination quickly, drive over the speed limit. The average maximum speed limit for cars in Europe is at 82mph, and to put it bluntly, people in the UK are already late for things most of the time and reducing the maximum legal speed limit would only make people later. The general opinion of the group was that it is those who are speeding and those who drive badly who are the ones who cause the majority of accidents on the road. We also felt that there are plenty of other more pressing issues that the government need to address, rather than the maximum legal speed for cars.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Speed limits should be raised on motorways.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the decision that the maximum legal speed for cars should not be lowered from 70mph to 60mph. This is because the current maximum speed is actually on the lower average in comparison to other European countries. Then, such a reduction wouldn't change the rate of accidents in any way. If anything, it should be raised on motorways. Modern cars are much safer than old models and 80 mph for instance would be perfectly safe. 60 mph as a maximum though would be utterly absurd. Seriously, having that speed limit on motorways would be a joke.
