# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the UK should not change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country.  The UK is a small island and has limited resources.  It is already quite easy to enter the country.  Making it easier causes a 'brain-drain' in other countries as it encourages intelligent people to leave their home countries with unrealistic expectations of life in the UK.  We should be making it more challenging to get into the country, especially when an asylum seeker has passed through other countries in Europe and chosen not to stay there.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the UK should not change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country. However, the current system is unfair and should be changed to make it fairer for genuine asylum applicants. The current system is unfair because it does not consider the circumstances of the individual applicant. The system should be changed to make it fairer for genuine asylum applicants. This is important since the UK has been part of illegal invasions of foreign countries and created population displacements leading to increased asylum applicants.  The illegal invasions of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan as well as direct assistance to brutal dictatorships in Saudi Arabia and other gulf countries by the UK has increased asylum needs. This responsibility cannot be ignored and so the asylum system needs to be improved and changed to accommodate the increase in applications.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “The UK should change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country. However, this should be done with caution, as it would encourage more migration and exaggerate all of the current problems regarding illegal migration. In addition, the UK is already facing a housing crisis and it is not in a position to support an increase in the population. Therefore, the UK should not make it easier to enter the country. However, the current asylum seeking policy is not working and needs to be changed to accommodate the increase in applications. This is important since the UK has been part of illegal invasions of foreign countries and created population displacements leading to increased asylum applicants.  The illegal invasions of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan as well as direct assistance to brutal dictatorships in Saudi Arabia and other gulf countries by the UK has increased asylum needs. This responsibility cannot be ignored and so the asylum system needs to be improved and changed to accommodate the increase in applications. The asylum rules are simple, you should stop in the first neutral country you come to, we are an island how many 'safe' countries have people passed through to get here?  We can barely afford to keep our own economy afloat, our children are
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the UK should not change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country.  This is because the UK is already quite generous in the way it treats asylum seekers, and making it easier to enter the country would encourage more people to come to the UK, when in fact the country is already struggling to cope with the current number of asylum seekers.  However, there is a strong argument for making the system fairer, and ensuring that asylum seekers are not used as political pawns by the right wing media.
