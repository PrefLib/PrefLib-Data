# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While the ban on single-use plastics is a step in the right direction, we need to do more. A blanket ban on all plastics is not practical due to their usefulness and the long lead times on developing alternative materials. The plastics industry needs to invest more in research and development to find alternatives that are more environmentally friendly and governments should be willing to support these endeavours. It is also up to individuals to reduce their consumption of plastics and adopt more environmentally friendly alternatives where possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of banning single use plastics but not all plastics. Most people believed that alternatives to plastic were available. There was discussion around the banning of plastic in some areas but not others. For example, the group thought it would be sensible to ban plastic bags in supermarkets but not in small, corner shops. The group felt that a full ban would be too restrictive on smaller, independent shops. Overall, the group agreed that there were areas where it would be beneficial to ban plastic but that banning all plastics would be difficult and potentially unwise.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Definitely, we should ban certain types of plastic to help the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Plastic is widely used in everyday life, for packaging, transport, storage, building, clothing and more. It can be seen as a good material because it is strong, lightweight, flexible and durable. However, plastic is a problem for the environment and humans. While plastics are light and convenient to use, they are not as easy to dispose of. Plastic takes a very long time to decompose in the environment. If burnt, they can release toxic fumes. If dumped in the sea, they can be harmful to marine life, who can mistake plastic for food or get trapped in it. Plastics can also be washed ashore and litter the beach. As plastic is made from fossil fuels, its production is also energy intensive and is a polluting process. This is a problem for the environment and for humans. Therefore, it is good to reduce plastic use, especially single-use plastics, such as bags, straws, cutlery, containers, etc. Many countries have started to reduce the use of plastic by banning the use of single-use plastics. Governments can also give incentives to companies to use more environmentally friendly materials, or support research in this area.
