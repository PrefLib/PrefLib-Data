# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - To be truthful, I actually do not know what this means.  I did not know politicians could raise money.  I do not know what they spend donations on.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - One of the most crucial aspects of capping the amounts of total donations is to potentially stop politicians from corruption or being influenced by third parties. After all, the decisions made in a democracy should not be influenced by who and how much someone donates to a politician potentially influencing their decisions. Additionally, having caps on such donations could promote politicians' transparency and therefore be seen as more entrusted to their people
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I believe there should be a cap because it would encouragement a fairer system and help reduce self interest. politicians take far too much money from donors with little accountability or oversight in our current political system, of which many feel that is endemic with self interest and corruption and has little to do with true democracy, This will help hold our politicians to account, something that does not exist currently. Our politicians seem to make many promises to the people, which never get realised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think there should be a cap on the amount politicians can raise from donations. They could and do get back handed donations from all sorts of people and places which does influence what they do and how they treat certain things. Politics is all corrupt and they only play for themselves most of the time. All they care about is keeping themselves and their buddies pockets full and in control.
