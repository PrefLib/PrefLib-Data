# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be some restrictions on the right to demonstrate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the right to demonstrate should not be restricted, however when it stops emergency vehicles or people going about their daily lives then restrictions are necessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be restrictions on the right to demonstrate if it poses a risk to the public in general. Demonstrations should be permitted and in fact encouraged as it gives people the opportunity to voice their opinions and feelings on a certain issue. However, it should be limited and closely monitored to avoid a break down of law and order.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should be allowed to demonstrate for any issue they are passionate about as long as the demonstration is peaceful and does not harm or stop other people going about there daily lives. The right to demonstrate is a core human right, that should not be restricted by the government. It is one of the core pillars of basic freedom of speech, the right to demonstrate. Yes to the ones that causes mayhem in public e.g sitting on motor wars or randomly going to art places and destroying a painting for no reason. But same time if it's a peaceful demonstration then that's totally fine and there shouldn't be no restrictions. It would be wrong to put restrictions on the right to demonstrate.  We are all entitled to our opinions.  We are also entitled to display our opinions in the form of demonstration.
