# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, we feel that the teaching of religious studies should be a requirement in schools, however we also feel that it should be taught in a way that is non-biased and informative. It should be taught in a way that helps children understand the different religions, as well as the history of the world and the different cultures that exist in it. It is also important that children are not forced to believe in any religion, and that they are free to make their own choices when it comes to their personal beliefs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, religious studies should not be a compulsory course in schools. Religion is a very personal thing and should not be forced onto children. If they want to learn about religion, they can do so in their own time. Schools should be focused on teaching children practical and valuable skills and subjects, such as the STEM subjects and if there is time left over other knowledge that will help them in the real world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Religious studies courses should be made an option. The subject is too divisive to be taught as a compulsory course, and should be offered as an optional extra course. The subject may be of interest to some students, but for others it will just be a waste of time, and may even be offensive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We think that Religious Studies is a subject which is very important in society. We think that a Religious Studies course should be required in UK schools. However, we believe that students should be given the option to take the course and that they should not be forced to take it. We think that religious beliefs have led to wars, conflicts, discrimination and other problems in the past and that some of these problems are still present today. However, these beliefs have also led to cultural customs and art. The study of religion will give students a broader understanding of the world and of the people who inhabit it. We feel that children should be given the opportunity to learn about the different religions, as it can help them to develop an understanding and respect for different people and cultures. We do not believe that religious studies should be the only subject offered at school, and we do not believe that this subject should be compulsory for all students. Instead, students should be given the choice to take this course, and the option to take another course, such as a STEM subject, if they wish to do so.
