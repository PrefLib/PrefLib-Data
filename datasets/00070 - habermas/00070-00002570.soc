# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - no as it would decrease productivity and also leave us with less hours.  the current working week is fine and we have the weekend to relax and enjoy ourselves.  while it seems like a good idea I don't think it would work in the long run
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No...there are many reason's why. But it wont be across the board so whats the point. Maybe and i mean maybe a day off for the entire team or workplace as a treat for overall great business performance which can either be a team day out or if you just want to be at home then fine. But a day off a week seem's absurd with the amount of work hours you would lose week on week.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is very important for employers to provide appropriate rest time for their employees and it should be highlighted that they care about the well being and happiness. This would cultivate any business to flourish in every opportunity and the evidence can be recently seen as employees with longer/better quality break perform better in every aspect. This can be seen as more and more companies all across the globe are impletmenting three day weekends which is dramatically different to the old norm. This idea and glorification of the rat race should abolished as it provides an unrealistic ideology of the working environment. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, employers who do not provide their employee at least a day off from work every week should be forced to do so. Like the old saying goes "all work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy", it is very important for employees to at least a day off every week so they can rest up to stay motivated and productive. These rest days keeps the employees happy and happy employees means higher productive for and business or organisation.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 -  I think we have an extremely stressful working life and the long weeks are not good for our health.  Stress causes time off work anyway, so surely allowing extra time would cancel this issue out?  I do see that it could be detrimental to the economy by losing one productive day, however, I don't think I have seen evidence of this from other countries who have actually had a happier and more productive workforce.
