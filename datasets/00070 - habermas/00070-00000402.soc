# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that we should ban the import of single use plastics from China. This is because these products will inevitably end up in landfill or polluting the ocean, causing long term damage to our planet and marine life. There are many alternatives to single use plastics that are also inexpensive and readily available. We can no longer turn a blind eye to this issue.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “I feel China is unfairly targetted on environmental matters, considering India, Russia and the US are also responsible for many harmful environmental products. Thus, I feel a better argument would be to ban all single-use plastic products, regardless of their country of origin.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should ban the import of single use plastics from China as this would be beneficial for our environment. The plastic would not have to travel all the way from China and would help reduce the amount of pollution. We should stop using single use plastic all together, there are plenty of other options available to use and if there isn't we should start looking into making other options. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of banning the import of single-use plastics from China. Some concerns were raised, however, such as the effect on China's economy. The group was also in favour of banning single-use plastics from any country and all participants agreed that this would be a more effective method to protect the environment from these harmful plastics.
