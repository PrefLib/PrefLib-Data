# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of a basic income. The group felt that it would be good for the economy, as people would have more money to spend and therefore increase demand for goods and services. However, the group was concerned about how this would be funded. The group felt that the government would have to increase taxes to pay for this, and this would mean that the poorest in society would be paying for the basic income. The group also felt that it would be difficult to ensure that this money went to the people who needed it the most, and that it would be difficult to prevent people from abusing the system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of a basic income for all adults and children. However, it was felt that this should be means tested, with the basic income being reduced for those who have enough personal income to pay their own way. This would ensure that those who are able to work are incentivised to do so, and that the tax payer does not have to subsidise the income of those who are not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should introduce a basic income for all, it should not be means tested to give everyone the same incentives to work and to increase earnings. The income should be paid to the parent of the child, not the child themselves. This will ensure that the money is used in the best way possible for the child. It is important that this income is not means tested, as this will ensure that the lower paid end of workers are not disadvantaged and have the same incentives to work as the higher paid end of workers. This income should be paid for by taxing the higher paid end of workers more.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the idea of a basic income is a good one. However, it is very difficult to see how it could be funded. The government is already in debt to the tune of £2 trillion and so it is difficult to see where the money would come from. There are also questions over how it would be distributed. Would it be the same for everyone or would it be means tested? If it is means tested, it is likely that many people would be disincentivised to work.
