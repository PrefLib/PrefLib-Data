# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, it would be a good idea to offer cash rewards for anyone who can solve the world's biggest problems. This would incentivise people and businesses to try and solve the problems, however, there is a risk of corruption and fraud.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the idea of offering cash rewards for anyone who can solve the world's biggest problems is a good one, however, we should be careful that it is not open to corruption and fraud. Wherever money and government are concerned, we are skeptical that it is used in an honest and decent way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should offer cash rewards for anyone who can solve the world's biggest problems, however, we must ensure this system is not open to corruption and fraud.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of this idea. However, it is very important to ensure that the system is not open to abuse.  The system would also have to be set up in such a way that the reward would be given only after the problem is solved and not before.
