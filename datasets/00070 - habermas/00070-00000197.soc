# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is a strong consensus that taxes should be increased to fund the health service.  We should not wait to increase taxes until all cost-saving measures have been implemented, but we should ensure that all cost-saving measures are considered.  The consensus is that the increased taxes should be directed to those that can afford it most. The final consensus statement was arrived at by looking at the pros and cons of each opinion, and trying to incorporate all of the points of view into the final consensus.  The challenge of how to increase taxes was not considered, as the focus was on whether to increase taxes or not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the participants were in favour of increasing taxes to spend more on the health service. There were concerns over which taxes to increase. Some participants thought that taxes should be increased for those that could afford it most, while others were concerned about the tax increases putting people into debt. It was suggested that taxes should only be increased after all other cost-saving measures have been implemented.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the participants were in favour of increasing taxes to spend more on the health service. There were concerns over which taxes to increase. Some participants thought that taxes should be increased for those that could afford it most, while others were concerned about the tax increases putting people into debt. It was suggested that taxes should only be increased after all other cost-saving measures have been implemented. Conclusion: By allowing a group of participants to give their opinions on a question and their critiques on the first draft of the group's consensus statement, the group is then able to review the first draft consensus statement and revise it to reach a final consensus.
