# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK government should subsidise childcare. The UK government already subsidises childcare for certain people, but we think that it should be expanded to cover all non-taxpayers and basic rate taxpayers. This would be an effective way of reducing the claimant count and getting more people into full-time work, which will have a net positive impact on the economy and on the wellbeing of parents. High-quality childcare will enable children to hone their skills in various things ready for school, such as reading and mathematics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK government should subsidise childcare. The UK government currently does subsidise childcare at the rate of 80% of the money spent is returned to you within a universal credit claim. The government should continue to do so, and if possible (where budget allows) it should increase the amount due to inflation. It is our opinion that the amount the government subsidises should be increased with inflation. The government should subsidise more cost in the early years foundation stages due to the dramatic expense parents pay out to go back to work and allow their children to go to nursery, when children go to school (due to this being a legal requirement) they do not have to pay for this bar from extra charges.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK government should subsidise childcare for families with a low-income. This will reduce the strain of the low-income families who struggle to raise their children. The government should also increase the amount of subsidised childcare they offer to increase the income of these families, and hopefully increase their standard of living.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK government should subsidise childcare, because it's the right thing to do. Subsidised childcare will give a great start in life to many children across the UK and it will be a significant step in the right direction to reducing the claimant count. The government should expand the eligibility criteria and provide greater subsidies to people on the basic rate of income tax. Subsidising childcare would enable parents to work without the hassle of finding the money to afford childcare, and enable parents to earn more money, and with more money they can provide more to their children and save money for when they become a adult. It would also mean parents would have a break and a bit of freedom without their children for a few hours a day or a few days a week. It would also allow children to interact with other children of a similar age to develop social skills, that will be beneficial for their future. It would allow the child to learn in a structured environment.
