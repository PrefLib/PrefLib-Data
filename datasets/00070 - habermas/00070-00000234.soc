# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the UK should not have a free trade agreement with the US as it would create an unhealthy relationship between the two countries, which could lead to favouritism and corruption, which in turn would hurt the UK economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should have a free trade agreement with the US. While some have expressed concerns about this arrangement, I think it would benefit the UK overall. However, the UK must be sure to protect itself and its citizens from any risks that might come with this. The UK and US are both countries that are very economically strong, so we should not let these fears prevent us from coming to an agreement that would benefit both of us. I think the participants did a great job of coming to a consensus opinion! What do you think of the group's consensus opinion? Do you think you would have come to a different one?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should have a free trade agreement with the US. The UK and US are two major economies, so being able to trade freely with each other would only make our economies stronger. However, the government should make sure to carefully balance the advantages and disadvantages of this agreement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - A free trade agreement with the US would benefit both countries, however, the UK should seek to keep its individual identity and not become a clone of the US.
