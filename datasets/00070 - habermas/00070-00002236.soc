# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - A more comprehensive immigration policy needs to be implemented in the UK.  This is because the current immigration policy can be unclear in some parts and needs to be more specific on certain matters.  A more comprehensive immigration policy could provide more information on what evidence is needed to prove an individual’s identity.  This would help to prevent the unlawful actions of illegal immigrants entering the UK under false pretences.  It is also necessary to ensure the protection of human rights for people who want to enter the UK, and for those who already live in the UK.  A more comprehensive immigration policy could therefore specify what rights are in place for all people, regardless of their race or ethnicity.  It could also make the criteria for entering the UK more specific and in doing so, provide more clarity for individuals and reduce the risk of errors in the immigration system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that a more comprehensive immigration policy needs to be implemented in the UK. The current immigration policy can be quite unclear in some parts and needs to be more specific on certain matters. For example, a more comprehensive immigration policy could provide more information on what evidence is needed to prove an individual’s identity. This would help to prevent the unlawful actions of illegal immigrants entering the UK under false pretences. It is also necessary to ensure the protection of human rights for people who want to enter the UK, and for those who already live in the UK. A more comprehensive immigration policy could therefore specify what rights are in place for all people, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It could also make the criteria for entering the UK more specific and in doing so, provide more clarity for individuals and reduce the risk of errors in the immigration system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the UK government needs to create a more comprehensive immigration policy to ensure human rights and safety needs are met when entering the UK for immigrants.  The current immigration policy can be quite unclear in some parts and needs to be more specific on certain matters. For example, a more comprehensive immigration policy could provide more information on what evidence is needed to prove an individual’s identity.  This would help to prevent the unlawful actions of illegal immigrants entering the UK under false pretences. It is also necessary to ensure the protection of human rights for people who want to enter the UK, and for those who already live in the UK.
