# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, the group of participants have come to the consensus view that in general, the idea of allowing colleagues to trade holiday entitlement is a good idea. The benefits of this idea are that it would increase flexibility in the workplace and would improve work-life balance. It would also improve workplace morale and create a supportive working environment. There are however some potential negatives to this idea. These include the potential for favouritism and inequality, which could lead to bullying. There is also the potential for significant abuse of such a system. In order to combat these potential negatives, it is important that the system is properly regulated and that there are clear guidelines in place to ensure that the system is not abused.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the idea of allowing employees to donate holiday days to colleagues is not a good one. The idea of having the ability to donate holiday days is not necessarily a bad one, but it is not something that should be encouraged.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We agree that the idea could be misused and would open up avenues for bullying to occur.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to a system where workers are allowed to donate holiday days to each other. One of the advantages is that the system would promote an increased level of cooperation and would also generate a more positive and flexible work environment. The system would allow employees to develop and maintain better working relationships. The system would also have the potential to lead to a reduction in costs to the company by reducing employee absenteeism and thereby generating more productive work time. A major disadvantage of such a system would be that in extreme cases, this could really promote inequality and lead to favouritism. There could also be significant abuses of such a system if not properly regulated. Another disadvantage is that there may be pressure from colleagues to give up holiday days, especially if they are in a situation where they have not been able to take time off for a while. In extreme cases this could lead to an abuse of power. Another disadvantage of the system is that it could potentially lead to a reduction in staff at work and therefore have a negative impact on productivity.
