# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Capitalism is the current system and the most widely used economic system in the world. As with most systems, it is far from perfect. Capitalism as a whole has led to the enrichment of some and poverty of many. We believe that the UK should adopt a mixed system that takes the best of both capitalism and socialism. It should have a small socialist approach that benefits the common people by making the necessities of life, such as food and education, more affordable. It should also keep the current capitalist system that encourages hard work, personal gain and innovation. We also believe that there needs to be better democratic controls on the economic system to prevent extreme capitalism and corruption.

We believe that by balancing a small part of the economy with socialist principals, the UK economy can be fairer and people will have greater access to life’s necessities, such as food, housing, and education. This will allow for everyone to contribute more to the society and to their own wellbeing, making for a more healthy and productive population overall. The government will also have a better handle on the economy to ensure that those seeking to exploit capitalism for personal gain are checked and that welfare systems can be used to the fullest potential in support of those most in need. The focus of this reflection essay is to explore whether or not consensus reached by a group on the most pressing political issues is beneficial to a society. I would first like to state that I do believe that people have
