# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that the minimum wage should be raised. We think that it is important that people are able to live off the money that they earn. It is also important that people are not reliant on benefits to survive. Raising the minimum wage would help to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. It would also help to reduce the reliance on in work benefits. It would also encourage more people to apply for and remain in lower paid, often crucial roles that are the backbone of our society. The minimum wage should be enough for someone working full time (40 hours per week) to live on. You should be able to afford housing, food and some savings when working for minimum wage and only need one employment. To have anything under this benefits only those paying wages as the government have to subsidise those not earning enough. When a big company pays poverty wages and posts millions of pounds in profit that is not useful to the general public.  There could be different levels depending on employers and ages but the minimum wage is ridiculously low versus the cost of living.
