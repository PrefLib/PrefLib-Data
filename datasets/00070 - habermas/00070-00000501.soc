# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of higher taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. They argued that as cigarettes and alcohol are generally luxury goods, they should be taxed more heavily to help the country’s economy and because they cause health problems. The group also thought that higher taxes could potentially discourage smoking and drinking, therefore improving the health of the country’s population. However, there was disagreement as to whether or not it would work. Some thought that taxing cigarettes would only lead to people buying their cigarettes on the black market or buying cheap, more dangerous cigarettes. There was also disagreement over whether taxing alcohol would be effective. It was thought that it could encourage people to stop going to pubs, clubs and restaurants which would harm the economy and that it could even encourage them to purchase cheap, harmful alcohol.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be higher taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. They are both harmful to health and increase the cost to the NHS. Also, there are health benefits to be gained from cutting down the consumption of cigarettes and alcohol. The increased taxes could also discourage young people from taking up these habits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, we feel that there should be more taxes on cigarettes and alcohol because it will help the country financially and also encourage people to be healthier. The effects of cigarettes and alcohol on health are becoming more apparent which will help people to cut down on them and be more health conscious. It is also important to note that cigarettes and alcohol are luxury goods and not essentials so it is fair to tax them higher.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be more taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. The health and social costs of these products are much greater than the revenue they generate and as such, taxing them at higher rates may reduce usage and therefore lower the cost to society. This will result in people living longer and happier lives, a reduced burden on the NHS, and more money in the Treasury.
