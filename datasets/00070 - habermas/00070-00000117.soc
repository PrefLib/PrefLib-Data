# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Foreign aid should be a key part of any nation's policies and should not be limited. However, in times of austerity, foreign aid may need to be limited temporarily to ensure that our own people are not left to suffer. The amount of foreign aid that is given should also be dependent on the situation in the country the aid is being given to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group of participants were in favour of continuing to give foreign aid. The group felt that everyone in the world deserved to live a good quality of life and that if we could help, we should. However, the group thought that we needed to help our own people before helping others and that we should make sure we have enough money to help ourselves. The group felt that a solution could be to limit the amount of foreign aid we give or prioritise the countries we give aid to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group in general felt that everyone deserved to live a good quality of life. However, they felt that we needed to help our own people first and that we should make sure we have enough money to help ourselves. The group felt that a solution could be to limit the amount of foreign aid we give or prioritise the countries we give aid to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of continuing foreign aid. Everyone in the world deserves to live a good quality of life and if we can help we should. However, we should prioritise the countries we give aid to and should ensure that we have enough money to help ourselves.
