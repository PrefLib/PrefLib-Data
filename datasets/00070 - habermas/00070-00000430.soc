# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should remain a member of the UN, as it allows us to remain neutral, help others and protects us. This is important as it promotes peace and stops unnecessary wars. It also helps with any disasters which may arise, and if the UK gets into any problems, then we can rely on the UN to help us out. We had some interesting group and pair discussions about the topic. Below is presented some of the feedback and thoughts that were shared by some of the participants: I found the group discussions useful, because it was good to hear other people's opinions and get a balanced view on the topic. (Participant 4) This discussion was good as it allowed everyone to hear each other's point of view. I am glad we were able to come to a compromise. (Participant 3) The group discussion was good as it allowed everyone to express their opinion. It also gave everyone a chance to see how other people's minds work. (Participant 2) I found the discussion really interesting. It was also a really good way of getting to know the other people in my group. (Participant 1) I feel that the group discussion was quite useful, because I feel it gave everyone the opportunity
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should remain a member of the UN. The UN may not have been successful in solving all problems, but there are many more successful cases where it has helped countries to resolve conflicts and issues. The UK should stay in the UN as it would be detrimental to international security and peace. The UK has always been in the UN and leaving it would be against the UK's tradition of cooperation with other nations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should remain a member of the UN as it provides financial security and also ensures that our opinion is heard across the world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UN is a vital part of keeping the world in a diplomatic manner. The UK should remain a member of the UN to allow us to help other nations in times of crisis and to allow us to protect ourselves in times of crisis. This will also ensure that our voice is heard and that we can influence world decisions which can affect us.
