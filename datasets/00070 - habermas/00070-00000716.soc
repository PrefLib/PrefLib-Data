# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People should have to pay a tax if they want to own a car, however, the tax should be determined by the type of car and by personal income and valid circumstances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should not have to pay a tax if they want to own a car, but they should have to pay for the damage they do to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Car tax is a necessary evil. We need to pay for the roads, but the money should be ring fenced for that purpose, and not put into a general taxation pot. The money should be used to ensure that the roads are kept in good condition, and to reduce the impact of car use on the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should not have to pay a tax if we want to own a car. We should be able to choose how we get around. We should be able to use our cars without paying more tax for the privilege.
