# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Universities should not allow students to submit their essays in voice recordings, however we do think that it is a good idea for students to be able to submit a small paragraph outlining the main points of their essay, especially for students who struggle to write essays due to learning disabilities or other reasons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although essay writing is a traditional and effective way of expressing oneself and demonstrating knowledge, voice recordings could be considered a valid alternative to written submissions as it could be beneficial for people with learning disabilities. The consensus view was reached through a combination of each participants’ views and their understanding of each others points. In particular, the participants considered that whilst there were benefits to essay writing, some people may struggle with it. Participants discussed the benefits of written essay, in particular their usefulness in demonstrating understanding of complex topics, they were also discussed the possible ways in which essay writing can be difficult, such as those with learning disabilities. Participants also talked about other forms of assessment such as presentations, which could be a good alternative to essay writing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Universities should not allow voice recordings for submission of essays, as although it would help some students, there are many disadvantages.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Universities should allow voice recordings for essay submissions as it can increase accessibility and inclusion.
