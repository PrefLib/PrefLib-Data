# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the average person does not need a car.  However, this will vary depending on the area in which they live and their personal circumstances.  In some areas the lack of public transport may make the use of a car essential.  Also, there are some circumstances where the use of a car is essential, for example to visit a seriously ill relative.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the average person does not need a car. The availability of public transport, the ability to walk and cycle, and the ability to share transport with others can often be used to replace the need for a car. However, for certain people in certain situations the need for a car can be justified. For example, people who live in rural areas, people who have certain medical conditions, or people who have a need to transport large or heavy objects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the average person does not need a car. However, this is heavily dependent on the area that they live in and the availability of public transport. In remote areas and areas with poor public transport a car is essential for the average person. In areas with good public transport and shops, hospitals etc within walking distance then a car is not essential.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, the average person does not need a car. There are many different factors to take into account, for example, the availability of public transport, the individuals' needs, the area they live in and their personal circumstances. In general, if public transport is easily accessible, then it is a much more convenient and cost effective option for the average person. However, if public transport is lacking, then a car is essential for the average person to get around.
