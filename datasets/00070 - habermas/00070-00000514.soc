# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the decision that students should be encouraged to take a year of national service after their higher education. In the case of the participants in this study, they all agreed that this year of service should be voluntary, though encouraged. The reasoning behind this was that although the participants had originally had mixed opinions, it was the view of all of them that young people with a higher education should be given the opportunity to choose for themselves, whether to contribute to their country, or to move on to the next stage of their lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Students should be presented with the option to do a year of national service after they have completed their higher education, and the benefits of this should be explained to them. However, we as a group of participants believe that it should ultimately be their choice whether to take up this opportunity or not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that students should be encouraged to do a year of national service after their higher education. However, they should not be obliged. This was the final view of the participants in this study. The original opinions of the participants had been mixed, with some wanting to make it a compulsory requirement, while others were completely against the idea. However, it was finally agreed that the service should be voluntary, but encouraged, to allow the participants to make the choice for themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the participants were in favour of an obligatory year of national service for people with a higher education. They said that this was because many young people had their education funded by the government, and should therefore have the duty to contribute to the society that they live in. They felt that it was an opportunity for the people to have a chance to choose a path for themselves and to gain some experience that would be useful to them for the rest of their lives. They also said that this could be done for a year, or longer if the students desired.
