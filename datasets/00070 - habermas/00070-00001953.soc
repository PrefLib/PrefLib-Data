# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to unlimited immigration. The reasons for this included the fact that the UK is already overpopulated and that the NHS, schools and transport networks would struggle to cope with more people. The group also felt that it would be unfair on tax payers to allow unlimited immigration, as the government would not be able to provide for everyone. However, the group did feel that skilled workers should be allowed to immigrate, as this would benefit the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No. Unlimited immigration would be difficult to handle for the UK government. There are already issues surrounding immigration, such as language barriers and economic concerns. Our infrastructure could not support an unlimited amount of immigration. The participants also believed that it would increase discrimination, which would also be bad for the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, the group has come to the consensus that unlimited immigration should not be allowed. The reason for this is that the UK is already struggling to cope with its current population and the government does not have the resources to cope with an influx of immigrants. The group also felt that the economy would suffer as a result of unlimited immigration and this would be bad for tax payers and the overall economy. The group also felt that allowing unlimited immigration would lead to an increase in crime rates and the UK would become a less safe place to live. The group felt that unlimited immigration would lead to a rise in unemployment and this would be bad for the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe unlimited immigration is a bad idea because we already have an issue with immigration in the UK. The NHS is already over crowded and immigration would worsen it. More people would cause more problems with housing and we already have an issue with this. Immigration would also worsen the situation of people on the streets. More immigrants would worsen the working conditions for British people because there would be more people to choose from for jobs. More people in the country would cause the education system to worsen as there are not enough schools to cope with the current population.
