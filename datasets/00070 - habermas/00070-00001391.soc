# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK is not too small to remain an independent nation in a globalised world. We have a lot to offer other countries and should not lose our identity by becoming part of a larger globalised world. The UK is made up of many different races and religions and this is something to be celebrated. The UK has a lot to offer other countries in terms of our NHS, vaccines and financial services. The UK has a long history of being a global player and this is something we should be proud of and continue to be. The UK is still a good financial hub with very intelligent people who can navigate big amounts of money in a variety of different markets. We are not as well linked to Europe as we used to be, and this is something we should work on.

Conclusion: By allowing dissenting viewpoints to be taken into account, I found that a much more powerful and persuasive statement resulted. Although, admittedly, this is something that people would expect in a group setting and that is clearly illustrated from some of the critiques above e.g. participant 1 was not concerned by issues mentioned such as immigration, vaccines etc. because these factors have already been taken into account. The resulting statement does, however, aspire to take all viewpoints into account and is strong because of this.
