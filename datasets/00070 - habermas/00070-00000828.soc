# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I believe that the UK flag should have the crosses and the dragon. It represents the history and unity of the UK, and the inclusion of all the nations. However, I think that it is important to recognise Ireland as an independent country, and therefore the St. Patricks Cross should not feature on the UK National flag. It would feel wrong for Ireland to be featured when they are independent and not part of Britain. I think this would also cause trouble to have  Ireland in the UK flag and therefore I believe the UK flag should stay as is.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “We believe that the current UK flag should remain as is. It represents the unity of the nations of the UK and their history. We also believe that the addition of the Welsh Dragon to the flag would be a nice touch. However, we do not believe that the Irish St. Patrick’s Cross should feature on the flag as Ireland is an independent state and should be recognised as such. Furthermore, the addition of the St. Patrick’s Cross could cause problems for Ireland as it is a separate state.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the UK’s national flag should feature the English St. George’s Cross, the Scottish St. Andrew’s Cross, the Irish St. Patrick’s Cross, and the Welsh Dragon. This will show that the UK is united, and that it is a diverse country. It will show that the UK is not just England, but all the other nations too. The current flag only shows the English and the Scottish, and this could cause tension. By including the Welsh and the Irish, it shows that the UK is diverse, and that it is all the nations together. The only concern we have is that it will be very colourful, but we think that this is a small price to pay for showing the diversity of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the current UK flag should be changed to feature the English St. George’s Cross, the Scottish St. Andrew’s Cross, the Irish St. Patrick’s Cross, and the Welsh Dragon. This will be a symbol of unity and inclusion of all constituent countries of the UK. We also believe that the people of each nation should be able to vote to have their nation on the UK flag. There is a lot of in these nations about being part of the UK, and a lot of these citizens do not feel listened to. By allowing them to vote to have their nation featured on the UK flag, they will feel like they are being listened to, and one step closer to becoming independent.
