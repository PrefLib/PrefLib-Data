# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should be doing more to help young people who are struggling to buy a house.  One of the main problems that have been discussed is that the price of houses is too high in comparison to the income of most young people.  It has been debated that there are ways that the government can help in this instance.  It was suggested that a tax could be introduced on second homes or buy to let homes so that the first time buyer has a better chance.  In this day and age a lot of young people are forced to live with their parents for longer and it has been suggested that this tax could also be introduced if children are forced to live with their parents after the age of 24.  In addition to this, it was suggested that the help to buy scheme that is currently in place could be improved so that it is more accessible to more people and not just first time buyers.

It was also suggested that the government could increase the amount of houses that they build to help increase the supply and hopefully lower the price of houses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that young people should have the support of the government in an attempt to aid young people's purchasing power.  Despite this, there is not a straightforward answer to this problem.  One of the main issues with the government helping young people is that not everyone can afford a house; this is why so much help is needed, as it is a broad issue.  One person explained how the government taxing landlords with second homes and buy to let homes would be an effective help to young people, the opposing argument for this was that people who had been told that they could not afford houses would have their opinion officially confirmed by this tax.  As this tax could put people off wanting to buy houses as they fear that they would have to pay tax on a home that they could no longer afford.  An alternative to this was discussed and decided on by the group; it was suggested that a tax could be introduced if children are forced to live with their parents after the age of 24.  In addition to this, it was suggested that the help to buy scheme that is currently in place could be improved so that it is more accessible to more people and not just first time buyers.  However, there is some discussion to be had
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should be doing more to help young people who are struggling to buy a house.  One of the main problems that have been discussed is that the price of houses is too high in comparison to the income of most young people.  The consensus view was that there are ways that the government can help in this instance.  It was suggested that a tax could be introduced on second homes or buy to let homes so that the first time buyer has a better chance.  In addition to this, it was suggested that the help to buy scheme that is currently in place could be improved so that it is more accessible to more people and not just first time buyers.  In this day and age a lot of young people are forced to live with their parents for longer and it has been suggested that this tax could also be introduced if children are forced to live with their parents after the age of 24.  The group believes that this is an issue that affects most young people and if the government can do more to alleviate the pressure then they should.
