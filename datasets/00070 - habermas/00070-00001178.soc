# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we should not cut down on the number of fast food restaurants. Fast food restaurants should not be cut down because people should be free to choose what they want to eat. Fast food restaurants should not be cut down because people should be free to choose what they want to eat. Fast food restaurants should not be cut down because people should be free to choose what they want to eat. Fast food restaurants should not be cut down because people should be free to choose what they want to eat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Fast food restaurants have a detrimental impact on the health of young adults, the environment, and the availability of housing, therefore we should limit the number of fast food restaurants.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should cut down on the number of fast food restaurants because they are contributing to the obesity epidemic. Fast food is often high in calories, unhealthy fats, and sugar, contributing to obesity and related health issues among young adults. Reducing the availability of fast food can encourage young adults to explore healthier food options, leading to improved overall well-being. Fast food restaurants often generate excessive packaging waste and contribute to carbon emissions, so reducing their numbers can have positive environmental effects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe there should be an upper limit to how many fast food restaurants there should be in any one area, they should be spread out more to offer more local alternatives to the large chains and we should also encourage fast food to be healthier as some are already starting to adapt to. We should also make more education about healthy eating and exercise available in schools and the workplace as this is a big issue for both children and adults. We believe that ultimately people should be free to choose but there should also be a number of alternatives available and so long as they are not negatively affecting others through their own personal choices then people should have the freedom to decide for themselves and have a treat every now and then.
