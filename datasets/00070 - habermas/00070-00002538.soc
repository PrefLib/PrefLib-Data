# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It's important to understand our place in the world. With English being the dominant language, students should be reminded that it's not the only language and appreciate the skill others are displaying when they speak English as a foreign language. Learning a second language while young helps with learning further languages later in life. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Honestly no they should not have too. While a 2nd language is a great thing to have in your back pocket but  no one should be forced into it. As they would really care about learning and just be a waste of resources and time. Rather let the place be taken by someone wanting to learn.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes students should learn a second language at school like French, because it helps with their brain development and learn about other cultures other than their native language.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes I believe they should because it will give UK-based students an opportunity to compete with other children around the world where languages are more widely encouraged. Whilst English is widely spoken, I believe the skills and determination needed to learn a language will be valuable skills for children to develop. In addition, it will help open opportunities for travel and employment. In addition, when travelling, I think it is important to be able to show some respect towards people who speak different languages and not rely on them being able to speak English.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Children should learn a foreign language as it helps integration and can help them with future employment.. It can help with memory too and believe it helps with sharpening the mind.  it can help keep the mind sharp
