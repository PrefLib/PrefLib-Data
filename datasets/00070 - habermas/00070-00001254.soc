# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the idea of subsidising holidays for families is not a good idea. The government has finite resources and should spend its money on more important things. The holiday industry is already very profitable and does not need help from the government. There are charities that can help families who cannot afford holidays and it is not the government's role to provide holidays. However, the government could look at ways of reducing the cost of holidays, such as reducing VAT on holiday accommodation.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should not subsidise holidays for families, as this would be unfair to those who cannot afford holidays and it would also be a waste of valuable resources. However, there are charities that can help families who cannot afford holidays and the government could consider reducing VAT on holiday accommodation to reduce the cost of holidays.
