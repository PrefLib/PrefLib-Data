# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “In general, the group was in favour of banning animal testing. However, we did not completely rule out the possibility of using animals in testing. In cases where human lives are at risk, we would allow animal testing, as long as the animals are treated with care and respect.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that animal testing should be banned. We should be more concerned about the welfare of animals than the development of drugs and cosmetics. We can use human tissue to test new drugs and cosmetics and also use computational models to reduce and replace the use of animals in testing. We should use the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) in animal testing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Animal testing should be banned. Humans should not be treated as guinea pigs. The animal testing should be replaced by other alternate methods like human testing, computational models etc. The only exception would be for testing of medical products like drugs, cosmetics etc.
