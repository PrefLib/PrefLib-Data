# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to a ban on the sale of tobacco and alcohol. The group felt that it is the responsibility of the individual to monitor and limit their own use of these products. Although there are very obvious harms both to individuals and wider society associated with both tobacco and alcohol, the group believed that attempts to control its use are more effective through education and other means, rather than prohibition. The group felt that prohibition has been tried previously and has been unsuccessful, instead pushing its consumption underground without regulation and protections.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Tobacco and Alcohol should not be banned. The health consequences of these products should be made more widely known, but ultimately it should be the decision of the individual. Banning these products would push their use underground, increase prices and would be unsuccessful.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We think that the sale of tobacco and alcohol should be controlled but not banned. This is because there are obvious harms associated with both products but we feel that it should be up to the individual to monitor and limit their own use. In addition, there have been many efforts to reduce the use of tobacco products but we feel the best way is to promote the "stop smoking" message. Certain types of alcohol, particularly those targeted at younger people should be regulated. However we feel it would be wrong to lump everyone together under a blanket ban.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to a ban on the sale of tobacco and alcohol. There was a strong feeling that it was a matter of personal choice and that people should be free to make their own decisions. However, it was felt that the sale of alcohol to under 18s should be banned, and that the sale of tobacco to under 18s should be more strictly controlled. It was also felt that the sale of alcohol in supermarkets should be more strictly controlled, and that the sale of alcohol in the vicinity of schools should be banned.
