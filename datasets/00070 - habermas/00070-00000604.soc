# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Companies should be obliged to report on the ethnicity pay gap as this would provide transparency on any potential issues and would encourage companies to take action in promoting equality within the workplace.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Companies should be obliged to report on the ethnicity pay gap.  This will allow for the issue to be tackled and make it clear that it is not acceptable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Companies should be obliged to report on the ethnicity pay gap as this would provide full transparency and remove any discrimination.  Only after this data is known can we start to tackle the pay gap issue.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Companies should be obliged to report on the ethnicity pay gap.  This is so that the issues can be highlighted and so that companies can be held to account for any discrimination.  If companies are not obliged to report on the ethnicity pay gap, then it will not be possible to tackle the issue.
