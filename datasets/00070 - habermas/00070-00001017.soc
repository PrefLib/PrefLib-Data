# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group of participants was in favour of a universal basic income, which would be available to everyone and would be enough to live on. However, we thought that it should be targeted at those who really need it, such as the unemployed and disabled. We also thought that it would be a good idea to remove the stigma of benefits by making it available to everyone, but that this would be a waste of money if it was given to people who don’t really need it. We also thought that the amount of the basic income should be enough to live on, but not enough to make people want to stop working.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A universal basic income would be a good idea. The current benefits system is not working and people in need should not be made to feel like scroungers. It would be a waste of money if the universal income was given to people who don’t really need it, so it should be targeted at those who are unemployed or disabled. We thought that it would be a good idea to remove the stigma of benefits by making it available to everyone, but that this would be a waste of money if it was given to people who don’t really need it. We also thought that the amount of the basic income should be enough to live on, but not enough to make people want to stop working.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - A universal basic income is a good idea, but it should not be given to everyone. Instead, it should be given to those who are unable to work, such as the unemployed and disabled. This will remove the stigma of benefits and make people feel like they are not being treated unfairly. The amount of the universal basic income should be enough to live on, but not enough to make people want to stop working. It should also be targeted at those who really need it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of a universal basic income. However, we thought that it should be targeted at those who really need it, such as the unemployed and disabled. We thought that it would be a good idea to remove the stigma of benefits by making it available to everyone, but that this would be a waste of money if it was given to people who don’t really need it. We also thought that the amount of the basic income should be enough to live on, but not enough to make people want to stop working.
