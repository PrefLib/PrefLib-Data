# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Facial recognition technology can be useful in solving crimes and keeping the public safe. However, there are also privacy concerns. In our opinion, the technology should only be used in certain circumstances and with proper regulation in place to prevent misuse and abuse of the technology.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Facial recognition technology can be useful in the fight against crime and terrorism. However, there are concerns over privacy and civil liberties and it is vital that the government does not abuse this technology. Facial recognition should only be used in the most serious of cases and should be subject to strict regulation.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Facial recognition technology is a very useful tool that can help law enforcement agencies in their efforts to fight crime and keep people safe. However, it can also be a threat to civil liberties and the right to privacy. Facial recognition technology should only be used in the fight against crime, and only in the most extreme cases. Facial recognition technology should not be used to spy on innocent citizens.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Facial recognition technology can be beneficial to public safety and security. However, there is a need to ensure that the technology is not misused and that privacy of citizens is not compromised. Facial recognition technology can be a powerful tool to law enforcement agencies, but there is a need to ensure that the technology is used only for legitimate purposes.”
