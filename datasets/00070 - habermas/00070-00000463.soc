# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the government should be doing more to help the poor and the elderly. We think that it is important that the poorest are not forced to pay for the mistakes of the rich and that the government should be investing more in welfare.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should continue to help the poor and the elderly more than it does now, especially in the cost of living crisis. There needs to be a radical overhaul of social policy if we want to care for our elders, and massive redistribution of wealth in order to alleviate poverty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the government should do more to help the poor and elderly in society. As the gap between rich and poor continues to grow, and with an ageing population, the poorest in society are being hit the hardest. The government needs to radically overhaul its social policies and spend more on welfare.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The government should help the poor and elderly more than it does now because we have an ageing population and so need to provide for our elders. The cost of living crisis is making life harder for the poor and elderly and so we need to increase benefits and pension rates in order to provide the most basic things like food, heating and bills. It is not enough to just pay the bills of the elderly and poor, we need to work to end poverty and the gap between the rich and poor. This should be a priority for the government and so needs a radical overhaul of social policy.”
