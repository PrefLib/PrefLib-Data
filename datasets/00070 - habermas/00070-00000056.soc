# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, people should be encouraged to buy property in London. The current housing climate is in need of a solution. This needs to be addressed with tax incentives for first time buyers. The opinion for and against each participant are clear to see, so let's look at what the group did.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should not be encouraged to buy a home in London, however, key workers such as teachers, nurses and other public sector workers should be offered affordable properties so that they do not have to live too far from work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People should be encouraged to buy a home in London if they can afford to and are committed to staying in the city. London is losing the community feeling due to investment from the super-rich and more housing needs to be made available to people who actually live and work in London.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People should not be encouraged to buy a home in London, but if they can afford to buy a home and if they can meet the mortgage requirements then they should be able to buy a home. The London market is already inflated and it will become unsustainable in the long run. There is a huge gap between the rich and the poor in London and this gap is growing bigger. As a result of this, people who live and work in London should be offered key worker housing.
