# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that endangered species need to be protected. The environment needs to be protected to allow these species to continue to survive. There are various other reasons for this as well, such as how these species add to the ecosystem in the world, and how they can provide us with new ideas that can help us humans solve real-world problems.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that the protection of endangered species is a vital task for the human race. We must remember that the natural world has been evolving for millions of years and it would be arrogant to assume that we are the pinnacle of evolution. In fact, we are still very much part of the natural world and we rely on it for our survival. We must remember that we are also part of a larger ecosystem and the extinction of any species can have a knock on effect on the entire system. Therefore, we must protect endangered species to ensure the survival of the natural world. We must also remember that there is a great deal that we can learn from other species, and that we can use this knowledge to solve real world problems.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, we should make more effort to protect and improve the environment for endangered species. This is because they are a part of the ecosystem and if they disappear, it will have a knock on effect on other species. In addition, they have a right to life, and a world with diverse species is more exciting.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We think that endangered species should be given a higher priority in government spending. Not only is it our moral duty to help protect endangered species, but the world would be poorer without them and they have many valuable lessons to teach us about our own survival. We have to ensure that the actions we take to protect them do not do more harm than good, so we must make sure that we protect the ecosystems that they are a part of and ensure that their habitat is protected. In order to be able to do this, we must educate people about the importance of the environment and how the loss of species will affect the survival of many other species. We also must ensure that we understand the impact of humans on the environment and work towards reducing this impact. We must use technology to ensure that we continue to develop without destroying the environment that we are a part of and the many species that are a part of it.
