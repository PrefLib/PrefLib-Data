# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should aim to reduce carbon emissions to a certain point rather than completely decarbonise. This is because complete decarbonisation is a goal that is unattainable at this point in time and would cause a great shock to many people. Aiming to reduce carbon emissions to a certain point is more attainable, and once that goal has been achieved, it could be the basis for which to expand on and achieve complete decarbonisation in the future. Conclusion: In conclusion, we can see from this activity that coming to a consensus view is more than just coming to an agreement on one thing. There is an importance in the process of agreeing and the consensus statement is not necessarily the end result. The consensus statement becomes a living document which is to be evaluated and changed as new ideas come to the fore. What this means for us: This means that when we are making decisions in groups, the final decision is not necessarily the end result. The decision is a living thing which can be debated and changed based on new facts and new knowledge.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should aim to reduce carbon emissions to a certain point rather than completely decarbonise. Although complete decarbonisation is a goal that we should be aiming towards, it is not a realistic aim at this point in time. It would require a drastic overhaul of the entire carbon emitting industry, which would have harmful economic effects which would impact too many people and cause a considerable shock to the system, which is not worth the achievable benefits of complete decarbonisation. Aiming to reduce carbon emissions to a certain point is more attainable, and would still bring considerable benefits to the people and planet. Once this is achieved, it can be the basis for which to expand on and achieve complete decarbonisation in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should try to reduce carbon emissions to a certain point rather than completely decarbonise. Complete decarbonisation is not a realistic goal to set at this point in time, as it would create a great shock to the prosperity of many countries and would be difficult to implement. Reducing carbon emissions to a certain point is a more realistic goal, and once this has been achieved it could be used as a basis to expand on and achieve complete decarbonisation in the future.
