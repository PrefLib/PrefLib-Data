# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - While it is important for individuals of a certain age to be allowed to vote in our democracy, we do not feel it is right to lower the voting age to 16. We feel that individuals should have a clear understanding of politics and understand the impact that the parties will have on them in order to make an informed decision. While we do believe that some individuals may be able to do this, it is more likely that most individuals will not be able to do this. The individuals may be politically literate, but the importance of the parties may not be as relevant as the issues of age such as money and housing. In regards to online voting, we feel that it should not be used as the main form of voting. This is because there are a number of security issues surrounding the online system, and we feel that there should be a physical process as well as this. In regards to the current voting system, we feel that it is fair and works in an effective manner. However, we do feel that there should be a review into the voting system, and that it should be changed to a system that will include all of the smaller parties, such as the second vote system, and that more information should be made available for individuals when they are voting
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the current voting system in the UK is fair and open to everyone of an eligible age.  The age for voting should be lowered to 16 as some individuals may be informed and mature enough to vote at this age.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the current voting system in the UK is fair and open to everyone of an eligible age.  The current system allows for people to have their say and for their vote to be counted.  The current system also allows for the government to be formed by the party with the most votes, which is the fairest way of doing things.  The current system is not perfect and could be improved in some ways.  For example, the current system is not the most representative of the people as it does not take into account the number of votes each party gets in each constituency.  This means that some parties with a large number of votes nationally may not get any representation in parliament.  This is not ideal but it is the best system we have at the moment.  If a better system is proposed in the future, it should be considered.  Until then, the current system should be kept.
