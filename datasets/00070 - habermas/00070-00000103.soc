# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Countries should be able to impose tariffs on imported goods, however this should not be a large amount so that it is not passed onto the consumer. Tariffs should be imposed in order to allow for the protection of domestic producers, whilst still allowing for the competition needed to keep prices at a fair level.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Countries should be able to impose tariffs on imported goods, however this should not be a large amount so that it is not passed onto the consumer. Tariffs should be imposed in order to allow for the protection of domestic producers, while ensuring the consumer is not affected by any additional costs that may be added.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Countries should be able to impose tariffs on imported goods. Tariffs should be small so that the cost to consumers is not too great. Tariffs should be imposed in order to protect the economy and domestic producers, however care should be taken to ensure that tariffs do not push up the prices of imported goods so much that it is the consumers who are adversely affected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Tariffs on imported goods should be a small amount so that they are not passed onto the consumer. The tariffs should be imposed in order to allow for the protection of domestic producers and so that there is a competitive level playing field or advantage to domestic good providers.
