# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is very clear that more must be done to prevent gun crime from growing. Current laws are simply not adequate, and stricter measures must be introduced. Gun crime may be committed by those who have obtained weapons illegally, or by those who bought them from a licensed distributor. Either way, we need to crack down on gun sales. The huge number of incidents, including those of a fatal nature, show that guns are still too accessible to the wrong people. While we can sympathise with people who use guns for recreation, and understand that there are certain professions which require to use guns, we believe that stricter controls on who can possess guns and how they are stored are essential. We also think that there needs to be more education and awareness in relation to guns, particularly when it comes to children. Children are the people who are most likely to see a gun and think that it is a toy, and therefore it is crucial that they are taught from a young age to understand that guns are dangerous and to be avoided.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: While we can sympathise with people who use guns for recreation, we believe that the potential risk, damage and threat is far greater than any possible benefit which could stem from owning a gun. Children especially need to be taught from a young age that guns are dangerous and that they are not toys. While there are many professions which require to use guns, we feel that new control laws on gun ownership are essential to ensure safety. We also think that there needs to be more education and awareness in relation to guns, particularly when it comes to children. Children are the people who are most likely to see a gun and think that it is a toy, and therefore it is crucial that they are taught from a young age to understand that guns are dangerous and to be avoided.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Gun crime is on the increase and we should not be complacent. There are simply too many incidents, including those of a fatal nature, that show that guns are still too accessible to the wrong people. While we can sympathise with people who use guns for recreation, and understand that there are certain professions which require to use guns, we believe that stricter controls on who can possess guns and how they are stored are essential.

Children are the people who are most likely to see a gun and think that it is a toy, and therefore it is crucial that they are taught from a young age to understand that guns are dangerous and to be avoided. We also think that harsher punishments should be put in place for people who commit crimes with guns. If the punishment for using a gun in the commission of a crime was a longer prison sentence, then people may think twice before getting a gun.

We also think that there should be much stronger sanctions for people who are found with illegal guns, and that the police should be more heavily involved in helping to prevent the spread of guns on the black market. We also think that more resources should be put into tracking the origins of guns to see where they are coming from, and we also think that more should be done to stop the import of illegal guns from countries where the controls are not as tight.
