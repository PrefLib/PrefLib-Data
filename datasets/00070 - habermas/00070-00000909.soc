# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group was in favour of the idea that the government should provide free life-saving treatment to any child who needs it. The group felt that this is an important issue and that it is the government’s duty to provide this treatment. The group felt that the government should provide this treatment as it is a basic human right. The group also felt that the government should provide this treatment as it would be beneficial for the economy in the long run. The group felt that the government should provide this treatment as it would be the morally right thing to do. The group was also of the opinion that treatment should be provided to the citizens of other countries if they happen to be residing in Britain at the time when the need for treatment arises.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The group was in favour of the idea that the government should provide free life-saving treatment to any child who needs it. The group felt that this is an important issue and that it is the government’s duty to provide this treatment. The group felt that the government should provide this treatment as it is a basic human right. The group also felt that the government should provide this treatment as it would be beneficial for the economy in the long run. The group felt that the government should provide this treatment as it would be the morally right thing to do. This applies to any child regardless of nationality. This final opinion takes into account all critiques and represents a true consensus opinion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We were generally in favour of the idea that the government should provide free life-saving treatment to any child who needs it. The government should provide this treatment as it is a basic human right to provide a child with life-saving treatment. There is also a strong economic argument. If a child does not have access to life-saving treatment, it is possible that they will not live. If they do not live, they will not contribute to the economy, and therefore be a cost to the economy. Also, the government provides benefits to children, so if a child does not receive medical care, they will become more of a burden to the economy than if the government had paid to treat the child and for them to then contribute to the economy. We therefore feel that it would be right for the government to provide this free treatment to children, both from a moral standpoint and an economic one.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We generally agree with the idea that the government should provide free life-saving treatment to any child who needs it. The government has a duty to do so and this will provide many positive benefits in the future. The group generally agreed with the view that free life-saving treatment should be a basic human right. The group was of the opinion that this is a morally correct thing to do and felt that this should be beneficial for the economy. The government should ensure that life-saving treatment should be free as it will help to create a fairer society which will help the economy in the long-run.
