# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK is still a world power, but only because of its nuclear capabilities. We still have a large cultural influence in the world but not enough to be classed as a world power.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “The United Kingdom is still a world power, but in many ways is a shell of what it once was. The UK is seen by many countries as a regional power and not a world power. The UK can still boast military power and cultural influence but is seen as a very pale shadow of the USA.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The United Kingdom is still a world power. We still have one of the largest and strongest armed forces in the world, we are still a major participant in NATO, and we still retain considerable economic, cultural, scientific, and political influence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the United Kingdom is still a world power, though with its current government it has little moral standing to be so. It still maintains one of the largest and strongest armed forces in the world and still retains considerable economic, cultural, scientific, and political influence. However, its overall power is dwindling in the face of ever-growing superpowers, and unless it undergoes a major reform, it will continue to do so.
