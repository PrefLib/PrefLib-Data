# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although the richest people in the UK are already taxed more than the poorest, I think it would be a good idea to tax them even more. The richest people have more money than they could ever need, and by taxing them more, this money could be used to help the poorest people in the UK.  We also think that taxing the richest people would be a good idea as they often earn their money by exploiting the poorest people. This means that the poorest people are often left with very little money, and we think that this is not fair. By taxing the richest people, we will have more money to improve the country's infrastructure and welfare services. The richest people will still be wealthy after this, but we think that some of their wealth would be better used if it was taken as taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of taxing the richest people in the UK. The participants felt that this would be a good idea as the richest people have a lot more money than everyone else and therefore can afford to pay more tax. The participants felt that by taxing the richest people, the UK would have more funding to improve the country's infrastructure and welfare services. The participants also felt that the richest people would still be wealthy afterwards, but some of their wealth would have more effective use if taken as taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK has a high rate of income inequality and one way of reducing this would be to further tax the richest members of the UK. The richest citizens own wealth on a different scale, which should not be seen as fair when people on the opposite end of the scale have very little. As many of the richest people get their wealth through exploiting  workers through poor wages and poor work environments, I think that further taxes would force them to give back. By taxing the richest people we will have more funding to improve the country's infrastructure and welfare services. They will still be wealthy afterwards, but some of their wealth would have more effective use if taken as taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the decision that we think it would be a good idea to tax the richest people in the UK. The UK has a high rate of income inequality and one way of reducing this would be to further tax the richest members of the UK. The richest citizens own wealth on a different scale, which should not be seen as fair when people on the opposite end of the scale have very little.
