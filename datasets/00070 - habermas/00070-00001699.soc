# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of high-speed rail.  It was felt that it would be a good idea in theory but in practice, the current government had spent a lot of money on projects which had not been delivered.  It was felt that the government should spend the money on maintaining the current transport systems rather than building new ones.  It was also felt that the current transport systems were in a bad state of repair and it would be more beneficial to spend the money on them.  However, it was also felt that the high-speed rail would be a good idea as it would provide more employment and apprenticeships for young people.  It would also help to modernise the country.  It was also felt that the rail would help to reduce the amount of car usage and therefore reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere.  However, the rail would have to be built sensitively to ensure that it did not cause too much damage to the countryside.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We agree that a high-speed rail link is an important project, but one that has to be considered as a whole.     To do this we feel the government must work alongside local councils and consider the needs of the whole community.     The impact on individuals and businesses must be taken into account, as well as the impact on the local environment.     Once these considerations have been taken into account, and local consultation has taken place, we feel the government should fund high-speed rail lines.     There must also be an agreed upon and achievable timescale for when this is to be completed by.     Finally, as part of this project, we feel it is essential that the current state of rail transport is not forgotten about, and an overhaul of existing railways must take place as part of the investment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should provide funding for high-speed rail lines between major cities, but only after all other public transport has been fully funded and maintained.
