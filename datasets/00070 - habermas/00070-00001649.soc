# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, we believe that the current top rate of 45% is too high and encourages tax evasion and avoidance. However, we do not believe that a tax rate of 30% is acceptable either. We feel that a tax rate of 35% would be the best option, as this would encourage people to pay tax and contribute to the society in which they live. The rich get richer and that doesn't have to be a bad thing if they contribute to the economy in a fair and reasonable way. We also believe that people with high income should not have to pay an unfair share of the tax burden and that it should be spread out more evenly. We all agreed that there are enough taxes in place already and that any changes should not impact the amount of money the government receive, only the way in which it is collected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the conclusion that the top rate of income tax should be lowered to 40%. We think that this is a fair compromise and will be a good thing for the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group feels that the tax rate should remain the same as it is. This is because this will help raise more money for the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the conclusion that the top rate of income tax should be lowered from 45% to 35%. This is because the current rate is too high and is making it harder for people to want to work and pay tax. We believe that by lowering the rate, people will be more willing to pay tax and therefore the government will have more money to spend on public services. We also believe that the rate should be lowered because the current rate is making the rich richer and the poor poorer. This is because the rich are able to afford to pay tax and therefore they are getting richer. However, the poor are not able to afford to pay tax and therefore they are getting poorer. We believe that by lowering the rate, the rich will not get richer and the poor will not get poorer.
