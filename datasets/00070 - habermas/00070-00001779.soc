# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus view: In the opinion of the group of participants, its not necessarily a bad thing that many adults don't read books, however its a missed opportunity for several reasons.  Firstly, books are such a diverse medium and offer a chance for people to escape to another world and let their imagination run free.  This is not to say that adults who don't read books cannot have their imaginations ignited by other media forms, but books offer the reader the chance to shape the world themselves in their head rather than passively watch or read about it in other media forms.  Secondly, research has shown that reading books has a positive impact on people's mental health.   Reading books, particularly ones which are challenging and/or contain some thought provoking content, stimulates the brain and helps to combat issues such as stress and depression.  Thirdly, books are the way in which society has recorded and passed down its history.  They offer a window into past times, enabling the reader to gain an insight into historical events, personalities, society, and culture.  They offer an alternative perspective on historical events from that portrayed by the media and are often far more informative.
