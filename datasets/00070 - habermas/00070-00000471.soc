# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should help the poor in other countries as it is our duty as humans to help others. However it is more important to look after our own people who are struggling financially and who are in need of the support. This is why we are all paying taxes to the government. So before any money is sent abroad it should be spent within the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although helping the poor in other countries is important, it should be done when the UK's own economy is not suffering. There are many other countries that can afford to help those in poverty more than we can.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the UK should aim to help other countries, however we should prioritise looking after our own people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In principle, yes, it is right to use some of the money from taxes to help poor people in other countries. However, in practise, we should always prioritise helping the poor people of our own country, as they rely on our support more and are also less likely to be able to help themselves.
