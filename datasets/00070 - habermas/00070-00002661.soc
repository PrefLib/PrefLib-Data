# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should not apply to rejoin the European Union. The EU is a bureaucratic nightmare that is very expensive. The EU takes very little of our views and opinions into consideration when deciding policy and making laws. The people voted, and a decision was made. We will improve in our financial standing if given the time to do so. We have retaken control of our borders. The cost of being a member was catastrophic. Being in the EU created extra layers of bureaucracy and took away our ability to make our own decisions which keep the heart of the British people at the forefront of what we do. We have many opportunities to benefit from leaving the EU. We need to make rules and laws in our own best interests at times. We also have opportunities to deal with other trading options. We have lost our power when we left the EU. It's ridiculous that I can no longer choose to live in Europe without restrictions and that we have travel restrictions between countries that are so close geographically. We see no benefits to not being in the EU and would like the opportunity to change that.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that the UK should not apply to rejoin the EU. The UK is still in the process of leaving the EU and we have not yet seen the benefits of leaving. We believe that the UK has made a democratic decision and should not be looking to backtrack on this. We believe that the UK has many opportunities to benefit from leaving the EU. We believe that the UK should keep close links with the EU but we need to make rules and laws in our own best interests at times. We also have opportunities to deal with other trading options.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the UK rejoining the EU. The reasons for this were varied, but included the idea that the UK had already made a democratic decision to leave the EU, and that the EU itself was a flawed system that did not take into account the views of the people. It was also felt that the UK would be better off making its own laws and trading with other countries, rather than being restricted by EU laws. However, it was also felt that the UK should maintain close links with the EU, and that it was important to maintain good relations with the EU and its member states.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to rejoining the EU. They felt that the democratic decision had been made and should be respected. They felt that the UK would be able to thrive outside of the EU and that the EU would not be able to function without the UK. They felt that the UK would be able to benefit from trade deals with other countries and that the EU would not be able to function without the UK. They felt that the EU was an outdated institution that was not fit for purpose in the modern world. They felt that the EU was bureaucratic and that it was not in the interests of the UK to be part of such an institution. They felt that the UK would be able to thrive outside of the EU.
