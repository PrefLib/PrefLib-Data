# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of lowering the top rate of income tax from 45% to 30%. There was a feeling that this would benefit the wealthy and that the government would have to recoup this lost revenue by taxing the poor. There was also a feeling that the government should be focusing on the NHS and other public services and not lowering taxes for the rich. However, the group was also aware that the UK has a very high rate of income tax compared to other countries and that this is driving some of the best people out of the country. The group therefore came to the following consensus opinion: “The top rate of income tax should be lowered to 35% to allow the UK to remain competitive with other countries and to ensure that we do not lose our best people. The government should recoup this lost revenue by introducing a new tax on the wealthy such as a tax on their property. The group was also aware that lowering the top rate of income tax would have a negative impact on the economy. This would be offset by the increased revenue from the new tax on the wealthy. The group also believed that this new tax on the wealthy would help to address the issue of inequality in society.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Lowering the top rate of income tax from 45% to 30% is a very complex decision. There are different viewpoints. We considered various scenarios and various factors to reach a consensus view. The final decision would be based on the economic conditions and societal priorities. The government would need to consider the consequences of this decision and the implications of tax revenue for public services. Lowering the tax rate could help stimulate the economy and encourage investment. It would reduce the government tax revenue, but the government could increase other taxes and fees to recoup the difference. This could also impact the poorer people in society. The government should consider increasing the minimum wage for workers and also reduce benefits. It could also provide tax breaks for small businesses, so that the economy would benefit. But lowering tax for rich should not be on governments list of things to do.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although lowering the tax rate for high earners could stimulate the economy, it is not in the best interests of the country at this time as it will take money away from those who need it most and reduce the amount of money available for public services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, the top rate of income tax should not be lowered to 30%.  The government would need to recoup that money by other taxes, which would inevitably have a negative impact on the poorer people in society.  The top rate of tax should remain at 45% to ensure that the poorer people are not forced to pay more as a result of any lowering of the top rate of tax.  The people on the top rate can afford it.
