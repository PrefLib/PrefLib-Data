# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK is better off inside the European Union. The advantages of the EU far outweigh the disadvantages. The EU is becoming increasingly bloated and ineffective. Due to its size there appears to be more of an emphasis on corporatism and big business to the detriment of individual countries cultural identities. These are the sort of traditions and way of life that foster meaning and a sense of community. With larger organisations this individual flavour is lost to the detrimental of an individual and a collective of any size. However, the interconnected nature of European economies means there is much to be gained from formal ties of the EU - moving from having a number of countries on their own not being particularly powerful or influential on the world stage, to a significant international power when coming together as one. Being in the EU generally means improved economic outcomes, more jobs, more investment, higher wages etc, and is very much a beneficial thing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The UK is better off inside the EU. The EU is a large market with a large population and a lot of money. Being a part of the EU has many advantages, including the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. We can also benefit from the freedom to live, work, study and retire anywhere in the EU. The UK is a multicultural country and the EU is a place where different cultures and nationalities can thrive. Leaving the EU has led to a number of problems, including the UK’s economy being worse off, increased costs of goods and services, a weaker pound and less investment in the UK. Many people have also lost their jobs. Being in the EU means that we can have a say in how the EU is run, and can have a say in laws that affect us. We can also influence the EU’s policies on the environment, human rights, consumer protection and other issues. The UK is better off in the EU.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK is better off within the European Union, however the handling of Brexit has been such a disaster that it may be impossible to return to the EU. The EU is a good thing in principle, with benefits of improved economic outcomes, more jobs, more investment, higher wages etc, and is very much a beneficial thing. However the EU is becoming increasingly bloated and ineffective. The EU is moving towards being more of a corporate body, and this is damaging to the individual flavour of each country and its traditions and way of life. There is strength in numbers, and the UK is so closely connected to Europe both geographically and politically that being within it would be better. The older generation may want the good old times but they really no longer exist and progress must be made. The world is a smaller place, and geographical borders no longer limit us. The younger generation wish to travel, to widen their horizons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the UK remaining in the EU. The participants felt that the UK is better off inside the EU as it is a large organisation that allows the UK to have a stronger voice on the world stage. The EU is also a beneficial thing for the UK as it improves economic outcomes, jobs, investment, wages, etc. The group also felt that the EU is becoming increasingly bloated and ineffective, and that there is more of an emphasis on corporatism and big business to the detriment of individual countries cultural identities. These are the sort of traditions and way of life that foster meaning and a sense of community. With larger organisations this individual flavour is lost to the detrimental of an individual and a collective of any size.
