# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should increase funding for the public health system. The health system is currently at breaking point and the additional funding would provide a much needed lifeline to this vital part of society. The public health system is one of the most important things that we have in this country and it would be a shame to see it continue to decline as it has done over the past years. The ageing population will continue to need additional interventions in order to support them through the later years, and the public health system is the best way to do this. The increase in funding will not go to waste, as the NHS has proven itself to be a very effective and efficient way to spend money. The NHS has done a fantastic job over the years and it is one of the best things about living in the UK. It is such an important thing to spend money on and it is one of the most effective ways to maintain public wellbeing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should increase funding for the public health system. The health system in this country is underfunded and has been to some degree for many years.  This is why we are seeing strikes and long waits for treatment/diagnosis. Additionally the ageing population will continue to need additional interventions in order to support them through the later years. By having a better funded health system, we can provide care to those who are underprivileged. The NHS is one of the brightest and best things about living in the UK. Pubic health is such an important thing to spend money on and it is one of the most effective ways to maintain public wellbeing. We should be ashamed that it has been left to languish as much as it has. It is one of the most important things that tax payer money can be spent on.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, the government should increase funding for the public health system. There is no doubt that the public health system in this country is underfunded. This is evident in the long waiting times for treatment and diagnosis, as well as the low morale of staff. The ageing population will also need more care and support in the future, and the current system is not equipped to provide this. There is also the issue of health inequality in this country, and increasing funding for the public health system would allow the government to provide more care for those who are underprivileged. The public health system is one of the best things about living in this country, and the government should be ashamed that it has been left to languish as much as it has. The public health system is one of the most important things that tax payer money can be spent on, and increasing funding for the public health system would be one of the most effective ways to maintain public wellbeing.
