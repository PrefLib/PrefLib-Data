# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that a basic income scheme is a good idea, and can help improve the lives of people around the world, by giving everyone access to a minimum income, regardless of employment, so that everyone can live with the basic necessities of life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The concept of a basic income scheme is an excellent one. There are so many who live in extreme poverty. A basic income scheme would be an invaluable resource in helping those individuals to access basic necessities such as food and shelter. It would provide a stable foundation for those with the desire to improve their circumstances, by increasing the prospect of obtaining employment in the future. However, it is also important to consider the concept of a basic income scheme from a business point of view. If all employees were entitled to a basic income scheme, and all of those employees worked for the same employer, the costs for that employer would be huge. It would affect businesses large and small, and if the impact was to be huge, this could have a devastating effect on businesses. It would affect job security, and result in many people losing their jobs as employers were no longer able to afford their employees, having to lay off workers in order to survive. However, with careful consideration of the issues around a basic income scheme, a solution could be found to make it a viable option, for the benefit of many people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that there should be a basic income scheme in place. It is only fair that people have access to a basic income, especially in times of need. It is also a good idea as it will help to reduce poverty and will help people to get back on their feet if they lose their job. It will also help to reduce the cost of living and will allow people to be able to afford the basic necessities. It will also allow people to be able to afford to look for work and to be able to afford to travel to interviews. It will also allow people to be able to afford to go to university and get a degree, which will help them to get a better job in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of a basic income scheme. They felt that it would be a positive step towards reducing poverty and improving the lives of those who are struggling financially. They also felt that it would help to reduce the stigma of those who are unemployed and provide them with a safety net whilst looking for work. However, they also felt that there would be some negative consequences. For example, it could lead to an increase in the cost of living and also reduce the incentive to work.
