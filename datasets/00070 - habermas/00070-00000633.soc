# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, the more we can do to reduce plastic in our environment the better, however, this needs to be a global effort and we must not forget the poorer countries where plastic bags and containers are used for collecting and storing water, this could lead to the spread of waterborne diseases.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a ban on non-essential plastics. However, the group felt that the term non-essential was a bit vague and needed to be better defined. For example, plastic bags are not essential, but some plastic bottles are essential.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that non essential plastics should be banned from supermarkets. We believe that if there are natural alternatives to plastics they should be used as a replacement. This is a good example of a group of people with differing opinions coming together to find common ground and agreeing on a final consensus statement. The outcome of this process was not to make one person happy and another person unhappy, but to try and find a solution that would be agreeable to everyone. This is a simple example of what a consensus process looks like. What is a consensus process? A consensus process is a structured process used to make a decision on a matter. The process can be used to solve a problem or to make a decision.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Non-essential plastics should be banned from supermarkets. If it is not essential, it should be replaced by an alternative, preferably a natural alternative.”
