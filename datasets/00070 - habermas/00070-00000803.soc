# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Police should be allowed to use drones to monitor certain public gatherings where there is a likelihood of tension and issues arising.  This should be based on a risk assessment of the likelihood of trouble arising.  This should not be part of regular policing, but rather a tool to be used when needed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Drones should be used to monitor public gatherings. The police have a duty to protect the public and the use of drones will help them do this more effectively.  There are no significant infringements of human rights in using drones to monitor public gatherings and this is outweighed by the public good.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the police should be allowed to use drones to monitor public gatherings.  This is for the safety of all involved and to allow them to act quickly if there are any issues.  There is a possibility that it infringes human rights, but for the greater good we need to have  good. security, especially with so many criminal groups in the UK presently.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The police should be allowed to use drones to monitor public gatherings, but this should only be in instances where there is a high likelihood of tension and trouble arising.  The police should not be using drones to monitor all public gatherings as this is an infringement of human rights and unnecessary use of this technology.  The police should also be mindful of the fact that they are being recorded by the drones and therefore should act appropriately.
