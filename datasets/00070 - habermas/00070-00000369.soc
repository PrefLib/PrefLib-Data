# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group have come to the consensus view that we should not build a bridge to Ireland because it would not be the best use of the government’s money. There are far better alternatives to transporting people to Ireland such as ferries which will be a lot cheaper and less time consuming.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of a bridge between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Some of the disadvantages include the cost, time it takes to build and lack of need for a bridge. However, the group conceded that the Irish sea is a barrier and therefore a bridge would help with connecting Ireland and Great Britain, but overall, the cons of a bridge outweigh the pros.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We have come to the decision that the government should not build a bridge to Northern Ireland. The cost to construct a bridge would be enormous and the end result would not be worth it. It is more practical and cheaper to use the ferry service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, the government should not build a bridge to Northern Ireland.
