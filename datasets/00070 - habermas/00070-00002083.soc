# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Private sector healthcare should not be allowed to compete with the NHS. If it is allowed to compete then the NHS will lose funding and staff as it will not be able to compete and may even shut down. It would also increase the price of private healthcare and lead to a US style system which would be extremely expensive and would impact lower-income households.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of letting the private sector compete against the NHS for the provision of medical care. The main reason for this was that it would create a two-tier system in which those who could afford private healthcare would be able to jump the queue and receive treatment before those who could not afford it. The NHS is a vital part of the UK and should be protected. However, it was also recognised that there are some areas in which private healthcare could be beneficial, for example in the provision of non-essential treatments such as cosmetic surgery.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, the NHS is a pillar of British society. The NHS is a service that should be available to all, regardless of their income. Allowing private companies to compete with the NHS will only lead to a two-tier system, which will result in people who can afford it going private, and people who can't going to the NHS. This will lead to the NHS being underfunded, and a reduction in the quality of care. The NHS is also a point of national pride, and should be protected at all costs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We think that the private sector should be allowed to compete with the NHS in providing medical care but only in very certain situations. These include when they are providing funding for areas which the NHS is not capable of providing at the moment and in some emergency situations. We think that this competition will help the NHS in some ways as they can see how private sector is achieving things and what improvements can be made in the NHS. We think that a lot of the improvements could be made through better technology and having people do tasks which they are most capable of, such as nurses administering medication. However, the private sector must not be allowed to compete with the NHS where there is not a clear need for it, and must also not be allowed to compete with the NHS in such a way that the NHS does not have the resources to provide the same service.
