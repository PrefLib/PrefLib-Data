# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: All children should be encouraged to learn a second language. Learning a language can be beneficial to a child in many ways, such as developing their ability to learn other languages, developing an understanding of other cultures and ways of life, and increasing the flexibility of the brain. The knowledge of another language is also a great asset in later life when children may choose to travel or work in another country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Children should be encouraged to learn a second language. Second language learning can be beneficial for a child in many ways. In the future, the knowledge of another language could be valuable during job interviews and in the workplace. The learning of other languages can help to develop relationships with people from other cultures and teaches children about cultural diversity. Teaching children another language can also improve their creative thinking and their literacy skills in their own language. If children learn a second language at an early age, it improves the flexibility of the brain and creates new neural pathways, helping them to learn other languages more easily in later life. Children should also be encouraged to continue to use the language that they learn and maintain the language throughout their lives. While it is possible that the value of knowing a second language in the workplace will change in the future, this cannot be predicted and therefore children should be encouraged to become bilingual.
