# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We don't think the minimum wage should be lowered to make jobs more available. We think this is a bad idea as it would increase the pay inequality and decrease the quality of life of workers on minimum wage. We think the current system has been shown to work pretty well, so we see no or little reason to change. Unemployment doesn't seem to be an issue (by historical standards). This could easily be abused by companies to heavily underpay workers and exploit them. We think minimum wage should be higher since it can help people afford more things, and companies should make it more easier for employees such as hybrid or remote working to save money on costs. Decreasing minimum wage will only make it unfair on people who are on minimum wage right now, as they're budgeting for their current income which is not even enough right now.

A copy of the dialog (with names removed) that led to this final consensus opinion can be found here. The longest turn in the dialog is of length 2. In other words, the program is provably Turing-complete. A video of the program playing back the whole dialog, which led to the final consensus opinion, can be found here. The video lasts for 6 minutes and 41 seconds. The text equivalent can be found here. A video of the program playing back just the final consensus opinion can be found
