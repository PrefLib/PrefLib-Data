# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that we should change our immigration policy to allow a larger amount of skilled workers into the country, but there should be a limit as to how many can enter. We think that there are not enough skilled workers to carry out important roles, such as doctors and nurses in the NHS, as so many of these workers are leaving the country, or are reaching retirement age, and we don't have the younger people to take their place. We also think that there should be a set of tests that the skilled workers should go through to prove that they are skilled and would be valuable to our country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We agree that we should change our immigration policy to increase the number of skilled workers we allow into the country. We think this is important because the economy is at an all time low, and we are going to need these skilled workers to bring it back up. These skilled workers would be able to help us out in a lot of different ways. They would help us out with a lot of the businesses that are struggling right now, they would help us out in the medical field as there is a shortage of doctors and nurses. They would also help out with the people who are leaving the country, and by increasing the number of skilled workers into the country, there will be more skilled workers in the country who can take their place.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of changing the immigration policy to allow more skilled workers into the country. This is because there is a shortage of skilled workers in the country and it is important to allow people with the right skills to come into the country to fill these gaps. It is also important to allow skilled workers to come into the country because they can help train our own people and improve the quality of life for everyone. However, it is important to be careful about who we allow into the country. We should not allow people to come into the country and take jobs that our own people could do.
