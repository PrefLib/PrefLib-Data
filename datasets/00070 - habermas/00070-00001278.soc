# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Basic Income Guarantee should be introduced for low income households. If implemented, this will reduce household poverty and help low income households and individuals to live more comfortable lives. Basic Income Guarantee should not be seen as a replacement for minimum wages, pensions, or other forms of welfare. There should be clear laws stating that Basic Income Guarantee should not be taken into account when calculating pensions, benefits, or minimum wages. This is to ensure that the scheme is not abused, and that those who really need the money get it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of a Basic Income Guarantee system. However, the group felt that there should be some regulations in place to ensure that businesses do not take advantage of this by increasing prices. The group also felt that the income should be limited to those who really need it, and not be given to those who are already well off.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the implementation of a Basic Income Guarantee would be a positive change to the current system. It would help many families who are struggling and living in poverty. It would also give people something to look forward to each month, and in turn, boost productivity and morale. At the same time, it would help lower income households to have access to a constant flow of cash. While this wouldn't be enough to survive on, it would definitely go a long way for many. We believe that this would be a positive change to the current system, however, we believe that there should be regulations in place to ensure that businesses do not increase prices to take advantage of this extra money.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While the concept of a basic income is a very interesting one, we feel that there are some important factors to consider before this system is rolled out. We believe that this system should be used, but only if all people in the UK were guaranteed a minimum wage, so that all jobs are decent paying jobs. We also believe that everyone should be guaranteed housing, so that no one is forced to spend this income on accommodation, which could go to improving other areas of their life. Furthermore, we feel that there should be protections in place so that employers do not use this income as an excuse to cut their wages, and that this income is not considered for purposes such as tax, benefits or wages. Finally, this should be seen as a stepping stone to an even better system, where our overall social security system is improved so that we no longer need a basic income.
