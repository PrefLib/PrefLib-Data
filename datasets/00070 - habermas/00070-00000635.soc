# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People with more money should be forced to pay more taxes. However, it is not necessarily the case that those with a higher asset wealth should necessarily be penalised by higher taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People with more money should pay more taxes. The current tax system is not working and it does not provide a level playing field for all. Some people with higher salaries are taxed at a higher rate, but there are also many people who have a lot of money, but who do not pay any tax at all. The tax system needs to be changed so that everyone pays their fair share.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People who earn a higher salary should be taxed more than those on lower salaries. However, people with a higher asset wealth should not necessarily be penalised by higher taxes - it should be done on salary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People with more money should be taxed more because they can afford it and the money can be used to help the less fortunate.
