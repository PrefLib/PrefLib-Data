Secondly, private media can provide valuable entertainment to society, which can often be overlooked in publicly owned media.  Finally, privately-owned media can provide a range of perspectives and entertainment to society, which can also be sometimes missing in publicly-owned media.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There is value in allowing privately-owned media. The different perspectives can provide the public with a more rounded and balanced view of events and issues. However, there are issues with private ownership, particularly around whether private media can be impartial and whether they can maintain high standards and principles, and avoid a focus on profit-making.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There is value in privately owned media, as it can provide different views to the publically owned media.  It is also important for the government to not be biased in their reporting to ensure a more balanced view on news and current affairs.
