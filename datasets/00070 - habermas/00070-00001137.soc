# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Driverless cars present one of the biggest changes to logistics and transportation in human history. Part of this change will be ensuring the safety of the public and other vehicles. While driverless cars and their ability to communicate with each other instantly may eventually lead to safer roads, it needs to be acknowledged that as with any emerging technology, there will be a learning process and that while safety should always be top priority accidents can and will happen. It’s up to manufacturers and regulators to respond correctly and promptly. Additionally, it must be determined if driverless cars are a zero-sum problem – if it meets a situation where a fatal accident is unavoidable, does it prioritize the life of its own driver if it results in a fatal accident? If not, this will need to be addressed before driverless cars can be introduced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the introduction of driverless cars will result in a decrease in the number of accidents. The biggest benefit of driverless cars is that they will be able to communicate with each other and with traffic lights to help prevent accidents. Additionally, removing the possibility of human error will help avoid accidents with the implementation of machine systems such as auto breaking, lane keeping, sonar and lidar, which can prevent accidents as they detect threats that humans may not have seen. One issue with driverless cars is if the car meets a zero-sum problem, eg you are in a situation where a fatal accident is unavoidable - does the car prioritize the safety of the driver if it will cause a fatality to someone else? This will need to be addressed before driverless cars can be introduced.

However, there will inevitably be an increase in accidents, particularly when the vehicles are in their initial stages of development, as there will be many initial failures and technical errors. Additionally, if the car meets a zero-sum problem, eg you are in a situation where a fatal accident is unavoidable, one of the biggest moral issues will be whether the car prioritizes the safety of the driver or potential victims in the street. This will need to be addressed before driverless cars can be introduced. The most important thing to note is that it is acceptable to change your mind, and that all viewpoints should be heard, before coming to a consensus. Also, to come to a consensus, all ideas, no matter how far out there or ridiculous,
