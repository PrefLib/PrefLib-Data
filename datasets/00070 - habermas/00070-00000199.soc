# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government has the responsibility of tackling disinformation. However, they have done nothing of the sort. Instead, they are the perpetrators of disinformation, most obviously during the Brexit campaign. We believe the government should be held accountable for this, and for their other mishandling of the pandemic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government is responsible for tackling online disinformation, but they have failed to do so. In fact, they are the perpetrators of disinformation. During the Brexit vote, they lied to the public with claims of “£350m a week for the NHS” which turned out to be false. We believe that the government should be held accountable for this, and for their other mishandling of the pandemic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government is responsible for tackling online disinformation. Unfortunately, they have done nothing of the sort. Instead, they are the perpetrators of disinformation, most obviously during the Brexit campaign. We believe the government should be held accountable for this, and for their other mishandling of the pandemic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the government has not done enough to tackle online disinformation. In fact, the government has used disinformation during the Brexit campaign and their mismanagement of the pandemic. The government should be held accountable for this, and for their other mishandling of the pandemic. Conclusion This experiment has shown that the combination of Crowdsourced Open Source Intelligence (COSI) and Qualitative Research can be used to discover insights on highly complex topics, such as the 2020 pandemic and the COVID-19 disease. In particular, it has been shown that a sufficiently diverse group of participants can be used to overcome the typical bias and lack of objectivity of qualitative research. In addition, the experiment showed that participants could be used to gain insights into a very controversial subject. This experiment has also shown that this combination of qualitative research and crowdsourcing can be used to conduct studies which are unobtrusive. Unlike the typical qualitative research method of interviewing participants, this method did not interrupt any of the participants.
