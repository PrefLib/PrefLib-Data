# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - While the group was generally in favour of the idea of free driving licence check-ups for all people over the age of 50, there were a number of critiques which had to be taken into account. There was concern that many people over 50 may not be aware of their own deteriorating physical and mental abilities. Many people over 50 may be reluctant to have their driving ability tested because of the cost, and the group felt that a free check-up would be beneficial in this respect. The group also felt that it would be important to stress that the check-up should not be compulsory, but that it should be made clear that it is in the best interests of all road users that people over 50 should avail of the free check-up. However, the group also felt that it would be important to stress that the check-up should not be made available to all people over 50, but should be available to all people over a certain age, such as 55. The main reason for this was that people in their 50s are generally more physically and mentally able than people in their 60s, 70s and 80s, and therefore the group felt that it would be more beneficial to focus on the older age group.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group in general agreed that people over a certain age, such as 55, should be encouraged to avail of a free check-up, rather than being obliged to. It was felt that a free check-up would help drivers over a certain age to assess whether they are still as able to drive as they were in previous years. The check-up should be offered to all people over a certain age, such as 55, but it should not be made compulsory for people over this age to avail of the free check-up. The check-up should not be mandatory, as it could be deemed discriminatory against older people to make it compulsory, however it should be stressed that it is in the interests of road safety that all drivers over a certain age should avail of the free check-up, in order to assess their driving abilities. The free check-up would also benefit younger drivers, as older drivers would be less likely to cause an accident if they have been shown to be still able to drive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of free driving licence check-ups for all people over the age of 50, provided that this was not made compulsory. The main reasons for this were that many people over 50 may not be aware of their own deteriorating physical and mental abilities. Many people over 50 may be reluctant to have their driving ability tested because of the cost, and the group felt that a free check-up would be beneficial in this respect. However, the group also felt that it would be important to stress that the check-up should not be compulsory, but that it should be made clear that it is in the best interests of all road users that people over 50 should avail of the free check-up. The group also felt that the check-up should not be made available to all people over 50, but should be available to all people over a certain age, such as 55. The main reason for this was that people in their 50s are generally more physically and mentally able than people in their 60s, 70s and 80s, and therefore the group felt that it would be more beneficial to focus on the older age group.
