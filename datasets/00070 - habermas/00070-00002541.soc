# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, absolutely, even with some problems it has brought, it has benefited us financially and culturally. It's allowed us to travel and experience the world when previous generations did not get the oppotunity. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes in general as there is more people to do skilled jobs in different parts of the world. Its also important that new technologies are available everywhere.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Globalisation has opened up the whole world.  It has provided people with choice and opportunities.  It has allowed for much fiercer competition , for example in global sales of everyday items.  However this can cause problems such as being unable to return items, or differing laws causing confusion and issues.  Therefore globalisation can be a good thing, but can have some negative effects, so is not a great thing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Globalization has had some positive impacts for humanity. At an Economic level it has allowed geographic specialisation in production which has helped provide economic benefits across the globe. On a human level, globalisation has helped to share and educate us all, in the diverse cultures of the world, gaining a better understanding of our neighbours on this planet.
