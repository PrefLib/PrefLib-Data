# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a higher tax on sugar in food and drink as it will reduce obesity and encourage people to eat a healthier diet. However, the higher tax should be used to subsidise sugar free products so they are cheaper. This will mean that the tax is fair and will not punish those that eat a balanced diet. It will also reduce dental problems and reduce diabetes.
