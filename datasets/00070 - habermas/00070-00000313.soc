# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, absolutely not.  This is will turn our online lives into commodities being traded for the profits and benefit of big companies.  It is also a severe privacy and security risk.  With important personal information about us being stored on multiple servers and beamed around the internet there will inevitably be data leaks that will expose that information to hackers and other crooks who will misuse it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, absolutely not. This is will turn our online lives into commodities being traded for the profits and benefit of big companies.  It is also a severe privacy and security risk.  With important personal information about us being stored on multiple servers and beamed around the internet there will inevitably be data leaks that will expose that information to hackers and other crooks who will misuse it.  We believe that it is not a good idea to allow corporations to buy and sell the rights to use people's data for advertising.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Corporations should not be allowed to buy and sell the rights to use people's data for advertising.  Giving coprpotations the right to decide to buy and sell this information could have negative ramificaitons.  People's data should never to sold off without the explicit consent of the individual.   Giving coprpotations the right to decide to buy and sell this information could have negative ramificaitons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, absolutely not.  This is will turn our online lives into commodities being traded for the profits and benefit of big companies.  It is also a severe privacy and security risk.  With important personal information about us being stored on multiple servers and beamed around the internet there will inevitably be data leaks that will expose that information to hackers and other crooks who will misappropriate it.  Even legitimate companies may misuse this sort of information to target people with innapropriate advertising that could be harmful to vulnerable people.  This sort of data trading is also likely to lead to even more data harvesting as companies try to maximise the profit they can make from this trade, leading to even more invasion of our privacy and exploitation of our online lives by tech companies.
