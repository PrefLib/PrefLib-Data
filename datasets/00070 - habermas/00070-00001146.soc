# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Capitalism is a good economic system but it has to be checked by socialism. There should be more control of the capitalist economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a balance between the two systems. Capitalism is the best economic system for the UK. It has been proven to work and has been successful in the UK. However, there is a need for a balance between capitalism and socialism. Socialism is needed to ensure that the economic system does not become too profit-driven and that it is fair for all. The balance between the two systems will ensure that the economic system is fair for all and that it is sustainable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be a balance between capitalism and socialism. Capitalism should be maintained to provide economic freedom and growth, but there should be more socialist policies to ensure that the wealth is spread evenly and that there is a safety net for those in need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Capitalism is the current system and the most widely used economic system in the world. As with most systems, it is far from perfect. Capitalism as a whole has led to the enrichment of some and poverty of many. We believe that the UK should adopt a mixed system that takes the best of both capitalism and socialism. It should have a small socialist approach that benefits the common people by making the necessities of life, such as food and education, more affordable. It should also keep the current capitalist system that encourages hard work, personal gain and innovation. We also believe that there needs to be better democratic controls on the economic system to prevent extreme capitalism and corruption.
