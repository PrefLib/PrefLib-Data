# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Nuclear power is much more consistent than renewables like wind or solar, similarly low carbon, and can produce a lot of electricity. With competent management there is essentially no risk of an accident like the one at Fukishima, as the UK does not experience serious natural disasters.  If the government is serious about continuing to provide the UK with electricity whilst lowering emissions, nuclear power is absolutely essential.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Nuclear power plants are a very efficient and powerful way of generating large amounts of energy. Despite the concerns regarding a disaster, with modern nuclear plants this is extremely unlikely Furthermore, they are also extremely environmentally friendly as they emit no carbon emissions. Nuclear waste can also be disposed of in an entirely controlled and safe manner. I do think nuclear energy will be the future of energy. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I do believe we need to move away from using oil, gas and coal so that we can address the climate crisis. I don't know much about nuclear power but I have heard that it is a decent solution to meeting modern energy needs, however I also understand that nuclear power plants create radioactive waste which is hard to dispose of. I would like more information.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I know it sounds scary, but we should. Nuclear is one of the best energy sources we have when taken into consideration sustainability and eficiency. General opinion from public about nuclear plants is negative because of disasters from the past, but technology has evolved and it's safe now
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I think we should focus on renewable energy rather than nuclear power. There are clean energy options available that provide better outcomes for the environment. Nuclear is not the best option when looking at power alternatives.
