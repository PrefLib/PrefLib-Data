# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The global north is at risk from terrorism, but not in a systemic or structured way.  While Islamic terrorism does exist, and will be a threat to a small number of countries in the global north, there are a large number of possible threats from groups with a variety of political and ideological motivations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the global north is at risk from terrorism, although this risk is lower than in the global south.  This is because most terror groups have objectives which are not focussed on the global north.  Examples of groups with global reach include Islamic State and Al Qaeda.  These groups often focus on groups which are in conflict with them, which have included, and are likely to include the USA, Europe and other nations in the global north.  However, most other terror groups have objectives which are focussed on the region in which they are based.  These include many insurgent groups in the Middle East, North Africa and Asia.  Therefore, these groups are unlikely to have an interest in attacking the global north. The group was then asked to form a new group with one new participant.  The question was then re-posed, and the opinions of the group were as follows:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is a constant risk of terrorism, though it may fluctuate between high and low levels.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is likely that some parts of the global north are at risk from terrorism. The answer is not definite, because the definition of 'global north' and 'terrorism' are somewhat vague. Some participants felt that they did not have enough information to provide a confident answer, but that the answer was probably 'yes'.
