# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People should be encouraged to eat more plant based foods and to cut down on their meat intake, but they should not be forced.  There are many benefits to this in terms of the environment and health.  Cutting down on meat would also reduce the environmental impact.  Vegetarian and vegan food should be accessible to all and there should be more education on the benefits of plant based diets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should be encouraged to be more vegetarian and vegan.  Eating less meat would help reduce greenhouse gases and help the environment.  This should be encouraged through media advertising and informing people about the environmental and health benefits.  Vegetarian and vegan food should be easily accessible and not more expensive than meat products.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of encouraging people to eat less meat, but not to become vegetarian or vegan.  The reasons for this were that the majority of people enjoy eating meat, and there is a risk that if they were forced to become vegetarian or vegan they would rebel and eat more meat.  Also, there is a risk that people would not be able to get all the nutrients they need from a vegetarian or vegan diet.  However, the group was in favour of encouraging people to eat less meat for environmental and health reasons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of encouraging more people to become vegetarian or vegan.  The group felt that it is important to consider the wider impacts of encouraging people to become vegetarian or vegan, including the potential impact on food security, the environment and animal welfare.  The group felt that it would be beneficial to encourage people to reduce their meat intake, rather than become vegetarian or vegan.  The group felt that this would be more achievable and would have a greater impact on the environment and animal welfare.  The group also felt that it would be beneficial to encourage people to buy higher welfare meat and eggs, and to buy free range eggs.  The group felt that this would have a greater impact on animal welfare.  The group also felt that it would be beneficial to encourage people to buy more locally sourced food.  The group felt that this would have a greater impact on the environment and food security.  The group also felt that it would be beneficial to encourage people to reduce food waste.  The group felt that this would have a greater impact on the environment and food security.
