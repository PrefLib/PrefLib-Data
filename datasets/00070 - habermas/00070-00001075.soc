# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison, but only when there is a genuine reason to believe the prisoner is rehabilitated and unlikely to reoffend.  There is no question that prisons are over-crowded, but the ultimate goal should be reducing the amount of crime and violence in society, which would in turn lead to a reduction in the number of people who need to be incarcerated.  In order to successfully reduce the number of prisoners, we need to have a robust crime reduction plan in place that tackles the root causes of crime in a sustainable way, and which can also be measured for effectiveness.  We should be trying to reduce the number of prisoners because of the problem of overcrowding, but more importantly to give prisoners a chance at rehabilitation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, we should not be trying to reduce the number of people in prison.  However, we should be trying to reduce the number of repeat offenders in prison.  The best way to do this is to focus on rehabilitation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that we should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison where this is part of an overall plan to reduce crime and is implemented in conjunction with the legal process and with sufficient deterrents to ensure that offenders can still be adequately punished.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison. This is for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is important that we give prisoners a chance at rehabilitation. If they are kept in prison for too long, it is likely that they will be more likely to reoffend when they are released. It is also important to note that prisons are overcrowded, and therefore it is not possible to give prisoners the attention that they need. Reducing the number of people in prison would also be beneficial to the prison service, as they would be able to spend more time and resources on those who are in prison. However, it is also important to note that not all prisoners can be rehabilitated, and some are in prison because they are a danger to the public. Therefore, we should not reduce the number of people in prison in all cases, but only when there is a genuine reason to believe that the prisoner is rehabilitated and unlikely to reoffend.
