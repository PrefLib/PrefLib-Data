# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of banning cars from city centres. This would reduce pollution and congestion, and also improve the environment and quality of life for people in the city. However, there were some reservations. For example, some people would not be able to use public transport because of a disability, or they would not be able to carry large or heavy items on public transport. Also, some people would have to travel a long way to use public transport and it might be more convenient to drive. The group suggested that it would be a good idea to have a park and ride system to encourage people to use public transport and reduce the number of cars in the city centre.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of banning cars from city centres. The reasons for this included the fact that cars create a lot of pollution and make city centres unpleasant to be in. In particular, participants were in favour of pedestrianised streets. However, it was also noted that it would be difficult to ban cars from city centres as there is a genuine need to take cars into city centres. The group felt that in order to reduce the number of cars in city centres, we should encourage people to use public transport more. This could be done by improving the public transport system so that it is more reliable and cost effective. The group also felt that people should be encouraged to use bikes to get around city centres. The group also felt that there should be more cycle paths in city centres.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although we would all like to see cars banned from city centres, we don't think it is currently possible to do this. There is not currently a good enough public transport system in place to cope with the extra influx of users. We think that the best way to reduce the amount of cars in city centres is to improve the public transport system. This would mean that people would be more likely to use public transport and less likely to use their cars. This would mean less pollution and make city centres a nicer place to be.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that cars should be banned from city centres as this will reduce pollution, congestion and make it a more pleasant environment to spend time in. We also believe that this should be done in conjunction with a good public transport system and cycle paths. We believe that cars should be banned from city centres as this will reduce pollution, congestion and make it a more pleasant environment to spend time in.
