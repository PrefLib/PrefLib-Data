# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should make it easier for people to pay off student loans.  The current system is not working.  Some students may end up in high paying jobs, but some may not.  If they cannot find a job, they will struggle to pay off the loans.  There should be a threshold income below which no repayments are made.  This would allow people to find a job, and not have the burden of repaying the loan when they are not earning enough to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of making it easier for people to repay their student loans, however, there was a strong feeling that this should only be done in cases where the person is struggling for genuine reasons.  The group felt that student loans are a necessary evil in today's society and that they should be made as easy to repay as possible.  The group also felt that there should be a greater number of educational options available to people other than university.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should make it easier for people who are struggling to repay their student loans to pay off their debt, but not in the form of simply reducing the debt, as this would encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford, and would lead to a vicious cycle of debt. Instead, the government should look at introducing a form of debt relief for those who have genuinely fallen on hard times, such as illness or redundancy, and who can prove that they are making every effort to repay their debt.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of making it easier for people to pay off their student loans.  This is because university is an important step for many people to improve their lives and the lives of their families.  However, the group was also of the opinion that the government should not make it too easy to avoid paying off the loan.  This is because the government is not a charity and is already spending a lot of money on education.  The government should not be expected to subsidise people who are not making an effort to improve their situation.
