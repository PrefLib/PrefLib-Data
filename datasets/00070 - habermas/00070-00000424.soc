# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to a new runway at Heathrow because of the potential for an increase in pollution, especially in the surrounding area. This would have a significant negative impact on the environment and should be taken into account when considering whether to build a new runway.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should not be a new runway at Heathrow. Building a new runway would lead to a significant increase in pollution in the local area and all over the UK.
