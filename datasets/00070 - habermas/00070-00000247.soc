# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should not generally intervene to make sure that employees of more successful companies are paid more generously. However, when a company reaches a certain size or profit threshold, the government may intervene to make sure that employees are paid an appropriate wage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the government should not intervene to make sure employees of more successful companies are paid more generously.  However, when a company reaches a certain size (e.g. Amazon) or makes a certain amount of profit, the government may want to intervene in order to ensure that workers are paid a living wage. (c)  The above is a complex task, and by definition, there is no right answer.  Instead, there is an ongoing process of creating a more refined, more polished consensus view, or opinion. (d)  In a consensus-based work environment, every individual is heard.  This can lead to a more complex process, which takes longer.  But the quality of the final product may be better, as the resulting consensus may be more broadly accepted.  This is a real strength of consensus-based decision-making.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the government should not intervene to make sure employees of more successful companies are paid more generously.  However, when a company reaches a certain size (e.g. Amazon) or makes a certain amount of profit, the government may want to intervene in order to ensure that workers are paid appropriately.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be some government intervention in the wages of successful companies, particularly in instances of monopolies.
