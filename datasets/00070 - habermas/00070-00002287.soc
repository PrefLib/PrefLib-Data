# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “The NHS is a great institution and the nurses and doctors in the NHS work very hard. However, it has been subjected to years of under investment and is no longer capable of dealing with the patients it receives in an effective manner.

It has been subjected to years of under investment and is no longer capable of dealing with the patients it receives in an effective manner. Waiting lists for operations are at all time record highs while the staff are underpaid and overworked. Many doctors and nurses are looking to quit and move abroad where they will receive higher pay and better working conditions. We believe that the NHS would be doing a good job if the government supported the NHS properly. We believe the current government is motivated to underfund the NHS and create issues to the extent that public opinion changes and favour privatisation. We believe the Conservative party wants an American style system where business can profit. This will be at the expense of the public.”
