# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group felt that the question was very difficult to answer due to the fact that the NHS is such a large and important part of the UK. It was agreed that more funding would be needed at some point, but it should not be the first course of action. The NHS needs to make the best use of what they have before asking for more. We should look at the health systems of other countries, such as the US, to see what improvements we could make to our own. It is important that the NHS is modernised and adapted to the current health problems of the UK, rather than funding it more and more without change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the funding for the public health system, but only if the money was used responsibly and efficiently. It was also agreed that the NHS should be updated and improved to ensure that it can cope with the increasing demands of an aging population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the funding for the public health system.  The NHS is an important part of British society and is something that we should be proud of.  It is important that we continue to invest in the NHS, however it is also important that this money is used in the most efficient way possible.  The NHS has come under a lot of criticism recently over similar topics, and one of quickest ways to amend the problems is to increase funding.  It is very telling that nurses are striking due to low wages and poor working conditions.  The NHS has come under a lot of criticism recently over similar topics, and one of quickest ways to amend the problems is to increase funding.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The NHS is a vital part of life in the UK, and we have the third best healthcare in the world, but we should be number one. However, the NHS cannot work with so little funding, it needs to be increased, but this increase needs to be efficiently and effectively implemented, as there are many problems with the NHS that need to be addressed.
