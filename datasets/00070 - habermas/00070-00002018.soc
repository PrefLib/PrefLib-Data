# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children under the age of 12 should be allowed to walk home from school on their own, as long as they have been taught the necessary skills to do so safely. This would include basic road safety, stranger danger awareness and a basic knowledge of the route home. The decision should be made by the parents or guardians, taking into account the specific circumstances and the child’s level of readiness for independent travel. Ensuring the safety and well-being of the child should always be the top priority.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children under the age of 12 should not be allowed to walk home from school on their own.  The world is a dangerous place and children are often targeted by criminals.  The children may not be street wise enough to know how to avoid danger and it is the parents' responsibility to ensure that their children are kept safe.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should be allowed to walk home from school on their own, but only after certain requirements are met. First, the route to and from school should be checked by the parent and child, so that the child is aware of any potential dangers. The child should also have their mobile phone and the parents contact number with them at all times. They should be able to identify all houses and locations along the route, and identify any strangers or potentially dangerous people. If all of these requirements are met, then it should be acceptable for children under 12 to walk home from school on their own.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children under the age of 12 should be allowed to walk home from school on their own, as long as they have the necessary knowledge and skills to do so safely. Parents and guardians should teach children the skills required to walk home from school safely, including how to keep themselves safe from physical and emotional harm, the potential dangers they may face, how to respond to a potential threat, and how to use public transport. It is the parents' responsibility to make the decision, taking into account the child's readiness for independent travel and the specific circumstances that could pose a potential threat.
