# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Libraries should be a place of peace and quiet, where people can come to study, read, or work. Cellphones are a part of our lives and will be for the foreseeable future. They should be permitted in libraries, however, only on silent or vibrate mode. The library should not have to put up signs saying that the use of cellphones is not permitted, but they should have signs indicating that cellphone use is only allowed on silent mode. This will be sufficient to ensure a peaceful environment in the library. Conclusion Libraries have been in existence for centuries and are a very important part of communities and society as a whole. The information revolution has had a tremendous impact on libraries. What was once the repository of all human knowledge has seen most of its responsibilities transferred to online databases and websites. The way libraries carry out their operations is under constant scrutiny and most libraries have been forced to find new ways of doing their work.  In the past the task of removing noise from the library would have been easily achieved by simply refusing admittance to anyone who would create a disturbance. However, in a country like Barbados where laws can make even the simplest task challenging this would be a risky strategy. According to the
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Libraries should be a place of peace and quiet, where people can come to study, read, or work. Cellphones are a part of our lives and will be for the foreseeable future. They should be permitted in libraries, however, only on silent or vibrate mode. The library should not have to put up signs saying that the use of cellphones is not permitted, but they should have signs indicating that cellphone use is only allowed on silent mode. If people need to make phone calls or answer their phones, they should temporarily leave the library, and when they are finished with their phone call, they may return to the library. This will ensure that people in the library will not be disturbed by people who need to use their cellphones, and will enable everyone in the library to enjoy a quiet atmosphere.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Libraries should be a place of peace and quiet, where people can come to study, read, or work. Cellphones are a part of our lives and will be for the foreseeable future. They should be permitted in libraries, however, only on silent or vibrate mode. The library should not have to put up signs saying that the use of cellphones is not permitted, but they should have signs indicating that cellphone use is only allowed on silent mode. This will be sufficient to ensure a peaceful environment in the library. The staff at the library should be trained to ask library patrons to put their phones on silent and leave the library if they are making noise with their cellphones.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should allow people to keep their cellphones with them while in the library. We should not ban cellphones from the library. People should be allowed to use their cellphones in the library, but only if they have them set to silent or vibrate. If they use the phone to make calls in the library, they should leave the library for the duration of their call, or they should have their phone turned off. This is fair, because even when the library is not crowded people don't always want to be disturbed. This policy will also apply to library staff, because they are no different than patrons. The only cellphones that will be permitted in the library are cellphones on silent/vibrate mode, all other devices will be banned. There will be signs throughout the library indicating that the library is a cellphone-free zone and that the use of cellphones for making calls is not permitted.
