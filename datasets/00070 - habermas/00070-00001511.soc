# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We think that we should not ban non-essential cosmetic surgery, but we do think that more regulations should be put in place to make sure that the cosmetic surgery industry does not exploit women and girls. It is up to the individual to decide what they do with their body, especially when they fund it themselves. We also believe that cosmetic surgery can help enhance someone's mental health and confidence, which is a worthy cause. We also think that cosmetic surgery can benefit medical research and may produce findings that could enhance future essential procedures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We think that we should not ban non-essential cosmetic surgery, but we do think that more regulations should be put in place to make sure that the cosmetic surgery industry does not exploit women and girls. It is up to the individual to decide what they do with their body, especially when they fund it themselves. We also believe that cosmetic surgery can help enhance someone's mental health and confidence, which is a worthy cause. However, there are no mental health benefits if the person continues to receive procedures rather than accept their natural appearance. Finally, we believe that cosmetic surgery can benefit medical research and may produce findings that could enhance future essential procedures, although this is not an excuse to subject young women and girls to pressure to change the way they look unnecessarily.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We think that we should not ban non-essential cosmetic surgery, but we do think that more regulations should be put in place to make sure that the cosmetic surgery industry does not exploit women and girls. We also believe that cosmetic surgery can help enhance someone's mental health and confidence, which is a worthy cause. Conclusion
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We think that we should not ban non-essential cosmetic surgery, but we do think that more regulations should be put in place to make sure that the cosmetic surgery industry does not exploit women and girls. It is up to the individual to decide what they do with their body, especially when they fund it themselves. We also believe that cosmetic surgery can help enhance someone's mental health and confidence, which is a worthy cause. Finally, we believe that cosmetic surgery can benefit medical research and may produce findings that could enhance future essential procedures.
