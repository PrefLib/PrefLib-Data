The problem is that raising the taxes on alcohol and cigarettes will make them unaffordable for some, which could increase tax evasion and increase poverty. The effect on the pub trade is also a concern. If we raise taxes on alcohol, pubs may suffer and there may be an increase in crime and disorder. I think the positives outweigh the negatives. I think that the NHS should be funded by taxes, and the money for this should come from the people who have put themselves in harm's way and have caused health problems.

However, we must be careful about how much of the cost we pass onto those who do not have the means to pay.
