# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Companies should be required to pay their employees a living wage, in order to protect them from the rising costs of living. This would be of benefit to both employees and employers as employees would be able to maintain a reasonable standard of living, without having to worry about financial struggles, and this would help to improve productivity and retention. It would also give employees the confidence that they are valued and appreciated for their work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Companies should be required to pay a living wage to their employees, because a decent quality of life is a basic human right that should be guaranteed by all companies. Without a living wage, many people would be unable to afford basic necessities and would have a far poorer quality of life.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Companies should be required to pay a living wage. The current economy makes it difficult for workers to make ends meet, therefore by making this a requirement, companies will see increased employee morale, leading to increased performance. In addition, workers will be able to take home an income that will allow them to provide the basic necessities for their families.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Companies should be required to pay a living wage. A living wage would be enough for a worker to support himself and his family. By paying a living wage, companies would provide their employees with a more comfortable life and increase their motivation to work.
