# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that we should be lowering taxes for the wealthy to incentivise the free market economy. By doing this, we believe that corruption will be reduced since the wealthy won't be trying to protect their wealth from tax and therefore don't need to have offshore accounts to evade tax. Also, the wealthy can spend more money in the economy. This is because they will have more disposable income. However, we don't think that the taxes should be lowered too much so that it's close to the next tax bracket. This is because we believe that the wealthy should still be paying their fair share of tax so that the public services can be kept up.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should not lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers. We believe that they are already paying a fair amount of tax and that it is not necessary to reduce this. We believe that the tax system is fair and should not be changed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should not lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers. This is because they already do not pay enough tax and reducing their tax will mean that less tax is paid.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers. This is because the wealthy will have more money to invest in the economy, creating more jobs and increasing tax revenue for the government. The wealthy will also have more money to spend on goods and services, which will increase demand and supply in the economy, creating a virtuous cycle of growth. We also believe that the wealthy will have more money to donate to charity, which is a good thing. We also believe that the wealthy will be less incentivised to avoid tax if taxes are lower, which will reduce corruption and increase tax revenue for the government.
