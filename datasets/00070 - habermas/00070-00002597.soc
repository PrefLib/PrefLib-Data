# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, I think so. Some of us may not perefer or just have a thing about lab-grown meat. We should have a right to know if it is contained.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No not at all, meat should be natural and not produced in the lab. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Why would the government want to approve this mandate? What good can come from lab grown meat? Surely fresh foods that haven't been messed around with in a lab are better for us. I would want to know more about why they think this is important before agreeing it should happen.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should not be mandating what is put in to our food. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: The population is growing by an alarming rate and lab grown meat will reduce pressure on farmers, as it can be produced quicker and easier than rearing some cattle and animals. Meat grown in a lab could reduce the number of animals needed to be killed and may cut down on slaughter houses that do not treat animals fairly or with respect. Finally, lab grown meat is immune from disease which can effect animals, such as bird-flu, TB, mad cow disease etc. This makes the product safer for consumption and also reduces the need for culling of infected animals.
