# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes. We think that there should definitely be separate public holidays to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. This is because these groups have historically been marginalised in society; and should have the opportunity to be celebrated for their achievements and their struggles that they went through. These public holidays would bring people and communities together. People would be more aware of what these historically marginalised groups went through and be more aware of the hardships that these groups faced. The final consensus statement noted that we would recommend the holiday to recognise these groups. It would mean that people who are not aware of the struggles that these groups went through would be more aware of the history of these groups. Furthermore, the holiday would provide people with the opportunity to educate themselves on the history of these groups, how they were marginalised, and what hardships they went through.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We do not think we should have a separate public holiday. We think that there is no need to have one. There are plenty of other things that we could use that day for.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should have a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. This is because historically marginalised groups have contributed to society and should be recognised for their achievements and what they went through. The holiday would also provide people with the opportunity to be more involved and educate themselves on the history of these groups and the hardships that these groups went through.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should definitely have a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups.  We believe that historically marginalised groups have contributed to society and should be recognised for their achievements and what they went through. The consensus statement also highlighted that having a holiday to commemorate historically marginalised groups would make more people aware of what happened and the hardships these groups went through. It would also give more people the opportunity to learn about these groups, and more people would be aware of the achievements and the struggles of these groups. The consensus statement also outlined that having a holiday would bring communities together and would help people celebrate the achievements of these groups and help people be more aware of the hardships that these groups went through. The consensus statement also outlined that the holiday would also provide people with the opportunity to be more involved and educate themselves on the history of these groups and the hardships that these groups went through.
