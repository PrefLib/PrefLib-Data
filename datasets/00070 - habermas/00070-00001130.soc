# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of having a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. The main argument was that it would be too difficult to decide which groups to include, and that it would be too many holidays. It was also argued that it would be difficult to decide on the date of such a holiday, as it would be very likely to clash with an existing holiday. It was also argued that it would be difficult to decide on the name of such a holiday, as it would be very likely to offend people. However, the group did agree that it would be a good idea to have a public holiday to celebrate the contributions of historically marginalised groups, but that this should be an additional day to an existing holiday, such as the summer or winter solstice.
