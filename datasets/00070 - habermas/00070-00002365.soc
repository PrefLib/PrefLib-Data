# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The BBC should broadcast content that some people consider to be too offensive. This is because people's opinions on what is offensive change over time. If we censor what is broadcast now based on people's opinions today, people in the future will be limited in what they can consume and so they will be limited in what they know. The BBC should also be allowed to broadcast content that some people consider to be too offensive in order to ensure that all opinions can be freely expressed. This is an essential part of freedom of speech and if people don't like the content that is being broadcast, they don't need to watch it. In addition, if people don't like the content, they can also complain to the BBC and so the BBC can then take this into account and change their broadcast accordingly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, we believe that the BBC should broadcast content that some people consider to be too offensive.  This is because we believe that the BBC should not censor any information that is important for the public to know.  It is then up to the individual to decide whether they want to consume that content or not.  It is also important for the BBC to be unbiased and so they should broadcast all types of content in a respectful way. There is a very good argument for the BBC not to censor any content that is important for the public to know.  However, it is also important for the BBC to be unbiased and so they should not broadcast content that is meant to be offensive.  It is then up to the individual to decide whether they want to consume that content or not.  This means that the BBC should broadcast content that some people consider to be too offensive, as long as it is in a respectful way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that it is right for the BBC to broadcast content that some people consider to be too offensive. The reason for this is because we believe that it is important for the public to be aware of the news, even if it is offensive to some. However, we believe that there should be boundaries in place to ensure that the BBC is not broadcasting anything that is illegal. We believe that it is the individuals responsibility to consume or not consume any content they wish, so people who don't like something simply don't need to watch or consume that content. We believe that the BBC should not be allowed to push an agenda onto the public to manipulate them and filter the news to their liking. We believe that broadcasting such content will help to educate the public and will provide the public with more information about it. We believe that it is important to have a debate over broadcasting content that is offensive to some people, and we believe that this is a good way to ensure that the BBC is broadcasting the news and not pushing an agenda.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that it is right for the BBC to broadcast content that some people consider to be too offensive. The reason for this is because we believe that it is important for the public to be aware of the news, even if it is offensive to some. However, we believe that there should be boundaries in place to ensure that the BBC is not broadcasting anything that is illegal. We believe that it is the individuals responsibility to consume or not consume any content they wish, so people who don't like something simply don't need to watch or consume that content. We believe that the BBC should not be allowed to push an agenda onto the public to manipulate them and filter the news to their liking. We believe that there should be a periodic review of the boundaries in place to ensure that the BBC is not able to push an agenda onto the public, but is also not broadcasting anything illegal.
