# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is important to encourage cultural exchange but not necessarily by directly promoting a culture. This should be more organic and come about by other means such as creating opportunities for people to study and work abroad. This is important to help prevent the dominance of one culture over another, which could also lead to the exploitation of the culture that is promoted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Cultural exchange is very important but should not be done by trying to impose one culture onto another, but rather through more organic means such as creating opportunities for people to study and work abroad.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is important to encourage cultural exchange and the ways in which this can be done should not be imposing but should rather be organic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be more opportunities for cultural exchange, but this should be done in an organic way. Countries should promote cultural exchange in a way that does not impose a culture on another country.
