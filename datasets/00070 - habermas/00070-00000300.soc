# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a need for more effort to be put into encouraging people to vote. Voting is the process through which representatives governing the public are elected. The entire system of democratic voting works on the principle of large numbers voting for the representatives to prevent cheating and underhanded methods to gain an advantage. Since the representatives are literally enforcing and changing laws, their election should have more attention and importance given to it. This is because the larger the proportion of eligible people who vote do, the better. The way this opinion is set out/written could be better though, much more concise.

The entire system of democratic voting works on the principle of large numbers voting for the representatives to prevent cheating and underhanded methods to gain an advantage. Since the representatives are literally enforcing and changing laws, their election should have more attention and importance given to it. Therefore, there is a need for an extra effort in making more people to vote. Being reluctant to vote is also a human right because one may feel that noone seems to be fit enough to represent her. If the whole eligible population were to vote then the outcome of the vote will more accurately represent the consensus of the population. If there is a lack of encouragement to vote, people may abstain and the outcome may turn out to not support the majority view but that of the population that voted.
