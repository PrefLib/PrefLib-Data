# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe the house of lords should be made up of a broad representation of the public in order to give a voice to all. This was a difficult process, and we were frustrated when we were unable to reach consensus initially because one of us felt the others were trying to force their views on her. It got easier when we were able to hash out how all of our opinions differed, but were able to come to a general agreement. We also learned that it is very important to take everyone's point of view into consideration when coming up with a consensus and we saw the value of compromise on this process. We also learned that consensus takes a lot of time, so we were very glad that it took us several hours to develop ours.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe the house of lords should be made up of a more diverse group of people from different backgrounds, and not just wealthy and privileged individuals. It is an outdated institution which doesn't represent modern society. The house of Lords should be elected by the people and open to all walks of life. We don't think a group of unelected, mainly wealthy, privileged people should be given power over anything. It's an idea from medieval times and doesn't fit in with modern politics. We don't even know how they decide if someone gets in. We think it should be voted for by the public and be open to people from all walks of life to make it representative of the people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We think that the way the House of Lords is constituted should be changed. We don't think that a group of unelected, mainly wealthy, privileged people should be given power over anything. It's an idea from medieval times and doesn't fit in with modern politics. We don't even know how they decide if someone gets in. We think it should be voted for by the public and be open to people from all walks of life to make it representative of the people. We also agree that there should be a broad section of people so that it represents everyone. We wouldn't discriminate against the wealthy but agree that it shouldn't just be people from privileged background in the house of Lords. It definitely is an outdated idea.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We think that the way the House of Lords is constituted should be changed. We don't think that a group of unelected, mainly wealthy, privileged people should be given power over anything. It's an idea from medieval times and doesn't fit in with modern politics. We don't even know how they decide if someone gets in. We think it should be voted for by the public and be open to people from all walks of life to make it representative of the people. Conclusion: Through the deliberative process, people with opposing viewpoints can exchange ideas, consider other people's opinions, and reach a consensus. In the process, people may change their minds, but, more importantly, they will recognize that others are acting rationally and in good faith, and this will reduce the hostility and increase the respect with which they view those who hold different opinions.
