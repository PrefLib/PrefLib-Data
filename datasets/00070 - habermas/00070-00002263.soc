# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of eating meat. They all agreed that the quality of the meat is important, and that it should be free range and from a good source. They also agreed that it is not necessary to eat meat everyday, and that it is important to have a balanced diet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that it is right to eat meat. We believe that the nutritional value of meat is very important to a balanced diet and that meat should be consumed in moderation. The group agreed that there should be a balance between the number of animals being farmed and the amount of land that is being used to farm them. The group also agreed that the animals should be treated well and have a good quality of life. The group also agreed that there should be a balance between the number of animals being farmed and the amount of land that is being used to farm them. The group also agreed that the animals should be treated well and have a good quality of life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is the opinion of the group that it is right to eat meat, although we do understand that not all individuals will want to do so. Our research has shown that meat is an important part of a healthy balanced diet, and that it contains lots of proteins and vitamins that are necessary for a human being to function. Our ancestors ate meat, and this is how they survived, therefore meat has always been a part of life. Meat also adds a large contribution to the economy. It is easy to source meat, as it is locally sourced, and is always available. We also believe that only meat that is free range and natural should be consumed. This is so that it is not contributing to the abuse of animals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While the science of nutrition is an extremely important one, we as a group cannot stress the importance of personal choice enough. We believe that while it is necessary to acknowledge the health risks associated with a diet high in meat consumption, we also feel that it is important to recognize that meat is a source of nutrition and energy for a large number of the world's population. We recognize the individuality of each person's needs and preferences, and we would never want to make an issue like this into a matter of right and wrong. For that reason, we are unable to give a black and white answer to the question of whether or not it is right to eat meat. It is our belief that it is each individual's right to choose whether or not they consume meat, and we believe that the arguments for and against eating meat can only be properly debated from the context of a specific person's life.
