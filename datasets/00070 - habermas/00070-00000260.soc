# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a maximum wage for certain jobs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The idea of a maximum wage is a controversial one, as it raises questions about individual rights and government control. While some argue that a maximum wage would promote income equality and discourage excessive wealth accumulation, others argue that it would be difficult to implement and could disincetivize innovation and entrepreneurship”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a maximum wage in some professions. For example, politicians should not earn more than 20x the average income in their country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the idea of having a maximum wage is a bad one. Although it might seem popular on the surface, a maximum wage could easily lead to high-value workers leaving the country, reducing the total income of the country.
