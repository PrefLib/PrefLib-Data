# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, the government should allow the sale of non-medicinal recreational drugs. The current criminalisation of drugs causes many problems both socially and economically. The UK already has a well established support network for those who are struggling with drugs. It would have a positive impact if this money was redirected to encouraging safe recreational drug use, and funding other areas such as the NHS. It would also lead to less crime, as there would be less drug related violence. However, it is important that there are quality controls on the sale of drugs and it is important to regulate this, as with other products.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK already has a well established support network for those who are struggling with drugs. We should instead encourage safe recreational drug use, and put the money we spend on policing drugs, into building support systems for those who are predicated to be addicted to drugs, or who are struggling for whatever other reason.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, the government should allow the sale of non-medicinal recreational drugs. We agree that it would reduce the criminalisation of drugs and make the streets safer, but it is important that quality controls are put in place. It is also important to state that any money from the sale of drugs should be redirected to the support networks for those addicted to drugs. Conclusion Using this consensus building technique, a group of people were able to reach a clear, well thought out consensus on the question posed. They were able to debate the various pros and cons of their differing opinions, and this led to a clearer understanding of the topic as a whole. In fact, at the end of the discussion, all of the participants agreed that the final consensus statement reached was the most appropriate and reflected all of their opinions. It is important to note that in reaching a consensus, the people involved were not forced to change their original opinions, but instead the draft consensus statement was tweaked to ensure that all opinions were accurately represented. Overall, this method of reaching a consensus, through communication and collaboration, can be very effective. It leads to a much better understanding of the issues, and a well thought out consensus statement, which can be put into
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, the government should allow the sale of non-medicinal recreational drugs. This will reduce crime, and the money currently spent on policing drugs could be put into helping those with drug addictions and other mental health issues. It would be important to regulate the sale of drugs and enforce quality control, as the current illegal market does not offer this assurance. This would reduce the amount of dangerous drugs on the market and reduce the health problems caused by dangerous drugs. This would also stop young people getting involved in criminal activity through county lines.
