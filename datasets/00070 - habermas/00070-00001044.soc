# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a ban on all single use plates and cutlery made from non-recyclable and non-biodegradable materials. The ban should be enforced by the government, and the use of such plates and cutlery should be made illegal. The ban should be rolled out in stages, allowing businesses to adapt and find alternative products to use. Fines should be imposed during the earlier stages, with the proceeds being used to help businesses transition smoothly towards more sustainable alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a ban on all single use plates and cutlery that are made from non-recyclable or non-biodegradable materials. This would ensure that the items that are banned are those that are the most harmful to the environment. The ban should be enforced by the government, and the use of such plates and cutlery should be made illegal. The ban should start immediately.

The ban should be rolled out in stages, to allow businesses to adapt and find alternative products to use. This is an important point because implementing the ban immediately would be very disruptive and would likely cause companies to go bankrupt, forcing them to lay off staff. Additionally, imposing fines would increase the financial strain on businesses, which could reduce demand. I agree with the comment made that a tax on the items would be an alternative course of action.

In this case, a tax is likely to be less effective as it requires consumers to act more responsibly and pay more for the materials. If consumers still want to purchase the products, they can still do so, and would be harming the environment even more. However, it could

The ban should be enforced by the government, and the use of such plates and cutlery should be made illegal. The ban should be rolled out in stages, to allow businesses to adapt and find alternative products to use. The stages of the ban could be combined with taxes, with proceeds going towards incentives to switch to sustainable products so there is a smooth transition while industry ramps up to meet demand at good margins. There should also be fines implemented in earlier stages to emphasise the importance of moving away from single use materials.
