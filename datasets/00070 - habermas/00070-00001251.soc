# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have a 50/50 chance of having the technology to download your brain onto a computer chip within our lifetime, due to rapid advances in technology and current events.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was unsure if this would be possible in their lifetime. Whilst there was some belief that it would be possible, others felt it would not. The group felt that the human brain is incredibly complex and that we do not fully understand how it works. This makes it difficult to know if we would be able to replicate it. The group felt that the technology is advancing at a rapid rate, but whether it would be possible to download the human brain onto a computer chip is something that is very difficult to predict.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There is a possibility that we could have this technology in our lifetime. We have the technology to connect our brains to the internet and computers and as time goes on this technology will advance and become more complex. We don't think it will be in our lifetime but it could be.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, we believe that the question posed is not in fact that far-fetched. We are living in a digital age where technology is advancing at a rapid rate. Whilst we don't think that the technology to download the human brain will be available in our lifetimes, we do believe that it is possible. We also believe that the possibility of technology advancing at such a rate is very likely, because of recent discoveries and developments. This technology would be very useful and it could be used to find cures for many diseases, such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons.
