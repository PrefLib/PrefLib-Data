# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No. The obvious benefit of GM babies is preventing specific genetic diseases and disabilities. This would theoretically lead to the overall improvement in general health for future generations. However, the potential for abuse and misuse is too high and concerning despite this benefit. I believe there is a slippery slope around this and raises serious ethical questions around what constitutes something that needs to be "treated" or "fixed". I also think that it would be extremely difficult to truly regulate this field and is easily subject to abuse from private entities and the rich. I also agree that we should not allow the creation of genetically modified babies. Changing genes to address or treat specific diseases may have unexpected consequences for other biological processes. Also, if these genes are then inherited by future generations, it might be difficult to control once they become commonplace in the general population. Modifying the genome of the embryo could cause unintended harm, not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit these same changes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should not allow the creation of genetically modified babies. The obvious benefit of GM babies is preventing specific genetic diseases and disabilities.

I believe there is a slippery slope around this and raises serious ethical questions around what constitutes something that needs to be "treated" or "fixed". I also think that it would be extremely difficult to truly regulate this field and is easily subject to abuse from private entities and the rich. I agree with everything that's written. I would also include points around the unknown impacts of gene modification further down the line.

I also think that it would be extremely difficult to truly regulate this field and is easily subject to abuse from private entities and the rich. This would not only create a two-tiered society with a lower and higher class but it also promotes eugenics and playing with human lives. The modification of genes in a single embryo will not only affect that person but also any children born from that embryo. Therefore, the repercussions of these procedures is impossible to anticipate and therefore potentially catastrophic. In this current climate where gene therapies are at least accessible and available in most countries in the world, it is extremely unlikely that allowing the creation of GM babies would help lower-income countries where they are least likely to have access to these therapies.
