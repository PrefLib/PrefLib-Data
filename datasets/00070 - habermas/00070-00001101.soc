# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While it is important for individuals who commit crimes to be held accountable regardless of their status, the question of whether it is appropriate to allow corporations to be liable for the crimes committed by their directors and employees is a complex and debatable issue. The importance of understanding the scope of employment must be highlighted. Crimes committed solely within the personal sphere of directors and employees must not be the responsibility of the corporation. However, crimes committed within their employment as a result of their access to information, ability to coerce and influence, or physical access to people or property, must be considered the responsibility of their employer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is important to remember that a directors and employees of a corporation can commit crimes outside of their employment, without the involvement of the organization in any way. But, crimes committed within their employment as a result of their access to information, ability to coerce and influence, or physical access to people or property, must be considered the responsibility of their employer. https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7127/6895597977_2b0b161697_b.jpg https://media-exp1.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/UR8aQJ0sXMR0ymP2nlekNVGNPTvGjS2HyqcoKoyC5lEzmohbpehqIjW1M1SSZJ2n__A/dimensions.jpg
