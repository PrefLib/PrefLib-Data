# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should absolutely grant the Caribbean islands their independence. However, it is vital that this does not involve a mass of new legislation or be a complex process. This is because these islands may not have the expertise or resources to deal with such an undertaking. Instead, a referendum of the islands should be held, and their consensus should be adhered to. If the islands desire independence, then this should be granted to them. If the islands wish to stay as they are, then the UK should continue to provide them with the resources and support they have become accustomed to. However, this support should not be indefinite, but only for a short period after which the islands would need to support themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should absolutely grant the Caribbean islands their independence. However, it is vital that this does not involve a mass of new legislation or be a complex process. This is because these islands may not have the expertise or resources to deal with such an undertaking. Instead, a referendum of the islands should be held, and their consensus should be adhered to. If the islands desire independence, then this should be granted to them. If the islands wish to stay as they are, then the UK should continue to provide them with the resources and support they have become accustomed to. The UK should also offer reparations for the terrible crimes which were committed against people in the Caribbean when they were colonies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should absolutely grant the Caribbean islands their independence. However, it is vital that this does not involve a mass of new legislation or be a complex process. This is because these islands may not have the expertise or resources to deal with such an undertaking. Instead, a referendum of the islands should be held, and their consensus should be adhered to. If the islands desire independence, then this should be granted to them. If the islands wish to stay as they are, then the UK should continue to provide them with the resources and support they have become accustomed to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should absolutely grant the Caribbean islands their independence. However, it is vital that this does not involve a mass of new legislation or be a complex process. This is because these islands may not have the expertise or resources to deal with such an undertaking. Instead, a referendum of the islands should be held, and their consensus should be adhered to. If the islands desire independence, then this should be granted to them. If the islands wish to stay as they are, then the UK should continue to provide them with the resources and support they have become accustomed to. Reparations are a non-sense and should not be considered. Period 5a: War Graves Period 5a was tasked with discussing how best to honour the victims of the American Civil War. The group set up a questionnaire and as a result came to the consensus opinion that a new memorial or graveyard is not needed. Their questionnaire and consensus statement was as follows:
1: 2,3,1,4
1: 3,1,4,2
1: 1,3,2,4
1: 2,1,3,4
1: 4,1,2,3
