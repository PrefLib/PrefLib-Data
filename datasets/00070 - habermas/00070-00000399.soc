# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: it is not right to keep animals in zoos, but in certain situations, such as when an animal is endangered and their natural environment cannot be guaranteed, it may be necessary to protect the species from extinction.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, keeping animals in zoos is not a good idea. However, if the zoo is doing a good job of keeping the animals happy and safe, and the zoo is taking part in conservation and protection programs, then the zoo is probably acceptable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Some animals can be kept in zoos but only if they are looked after very well and are only kept for a short time. There should be other reasons for keeping the animals in a zoo, like research, conservation or for safety reasons. This will keep the animals in their natural habitat and protect them. However, the number of animals that can be kept in a zoo should be limited.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There are lots of things to consider in terms of whether it is right to keep animals in zoos or not. In the case of endangered animals it is important to have some animals in zoos so that the species does not become extinct. However, we feel that zoos should be extremely careful about the quality of life that the animals experience. Zoos should not just be used for animals to be looked at. If animals are being kept in zoos then they should be there for research purposes and for the animals' welfare.
