# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Consensus view: Parents of children born deaf should be given the option to have the child’s hearing restored with surgery, but should also be made aware of the potential risks involved.  Surgery is not a magic fix, and may not result in the complete restoration of hearing that the parents may imagine.  Surgery may not be suitable for all deaf children, and parents should be given a range of options for their deaf children, and should never be forced into one avenue (eg surgery) because of lack of access to others (community and social support, signing, other adaptive aids).  Surgery should be offered as just one of these many options.  Parents of deaf children should be supported to develop the skills, knowledge and confidence they will need to communicate with their child and help the child successfully integrate into family and community life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Parents should be given the option to have their deaf children’s hearing restored with surgery, but should also be made aware of the potential risks involved. Surgery is not a magic fix, and may not result in the complete restoration of hearing that the parents may imagine.  The child may still need to use other forms of support and communication, and may still need to be part of a deaf community.  Surgery may not be suitable for all deaf children, and parents should be given a range of options for their deaf children, and should never be forced into one avenue (eg surgery) because of lack of access to others (community and social support, signing, other adaptive aids).  Surgery should be offered as just one of these many options.
