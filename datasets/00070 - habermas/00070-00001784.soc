# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a need for a more progressive tax system in the UK that taxes the rich proportionately more. The group also agrees that the tax-free allowance is too low and does not reflect the current cost of living, however, more consideration should be given to how this might affect public services in the current climate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: The tax-free allowance is too low and needs to be raised substantially. With the current cost of living, the level of the tax-free allowance needs to be at least doubled in order to give people a livable wage. We also think that the tax system needs a complete overhaul. It needs to be more progressive so that those on higher incomes pay proportionately more tax than lower earners. At the moment the wealthy get away with paying little or no tax due to the various loopholes in the tax system, and in light of the recent global financial crisis, the UK government is heavily reliant on money from working and middle-class families to balance the books, and this needs to change. The tax-free allowance is used as a way of subsidising tax cuts for big businesses, and more needs to be done to encourage big business to pay its share of tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Overall the tax-free allowance is too low, but the current climate means that now may not be the time to increase it. We want to be in a position where the tax-free allowance is able to support everyone. Now is not the time to increase the tax-free allowance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is a strong consensus opinion that the tax-free allowance is too low, and with the current cost of living, should be raised. This would be particularly beneficial to those on lower incomes who are struggling to live on the current allowance. However, the consensus opinion of the group is that there is also a need to look at the tax system as a whole, as it needs a serious shake-up. Many of us feel that the tax-free allowance is used to subsidise the tax cuts on big businesses, and that there is a need to look at the whole system and bring in a more progressive system that taxes the rich proportionately more. We also think that more needs to be done to encourage the big companies and the super-rich to pay their taxes.
