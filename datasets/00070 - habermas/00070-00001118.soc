# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that people should not be able to buy or sell drugs as they are extremely dangerous and can cause serious damage to your body. It is also illegal which means you could be prosecuted for taking these drugs. Drugs can also be linked to gangs which means you could become a victim of crime. Drugs are also addictive and people could become addicted which can have serious consequences on the health of the user. It can also affect people's mental health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should not be allowed to buy and sell illegal drugs as this can have a negative impact on people, and the more that this drug is sold the more people will want to buy it which can lead to deaths and causing people to suffer from serious health issues, which is why I believe that this should not be allowed as this can cause grief and heartbreak for families and communities which is why I believe that this should not be allowed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should not be allowed to buy and sell illegal drugs like cocaine as this can cause mental health issues and lead to disruptive behaviour. Also, as the people who are selling these illegal drugs are not checked or regulated, they can sell drugs that are harmful to people and this can cause death. Also, people can become addicted to these illegal drugs which can lead to people committing crimes to support there habits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, people should not be allowed to buy and sell illegal drugs like cocaine as they are illegal for a reason. There are a lot of harms associated with taking drugs and it can also lead to people committing crimes. To legalise buying and selling drugs would make it easier for people to use drugs and hence more people will start taking drugs.
