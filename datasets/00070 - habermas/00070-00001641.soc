# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, it is not ok to use tax havens. Tax havens allow for the wealthiest individuals to avoid paying their fair share of tax, which is a social responsibility and should be shared equally. It would feel like an injustice that some individuals or organisations get to escape this. Tax havens are also used for money laundering, which is a huge issue and can be hugely damaging to society. The use of tax havens is hugely destructive on society and allows for a great split on the income gap between the richest and poorest. In the UK we have organisations like the NHS that rely heavily on income from collected tax in order to function. When UK citizens spend their money and it is then sent out of the state into a personal tax haven to contribute to the wealth of an individual it takes away from the greater good. Additionally it allows for individuals with greater wealth to have more power over the state and its decision making capabilities therefore impacting lower class citizens, as they cannot suffer the same consequences as individuals who pay tax.
