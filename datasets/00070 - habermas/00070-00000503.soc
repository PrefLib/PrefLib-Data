# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a ban on the sale of diesel and gasoline vehicles. But there needs to be a lot of improvement in the public transport system to make this an option for the general public. And more government support for people to make the switch.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, they should not be banned as people will not want to give up their cars if the alternatives are not equal or actually better (cheaper, comfortable, frequent, accessible).  The public will not want to give up their cars if the alternatives are not equal or actually better (cheaper, comfortable, frequent, accessible).  This would also create many job losses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that a ban on the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles would have a very positive impact on the environment, but at this time is impractical due to lack of infrastructure, so we feel that it would be premature to ban them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the participants were in favour of moving away from diesel and gasoline vehicles and towards more sustainable energy sources. However, they felt that the infrastructure was not currently in place to allow for this to happen and that it would need significant improvement and funding to make this transition possible.
