# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of building new nuclear power stations. The group felt that the potential dangers outweighed the potential benefits. The group felt that the government should be investing in renewable energy sources instead, such as wind power and solar power. The group felt that nuclear power stations are a target for terrorist organisations and that the potential for a nuclear disaster is too great. The group felt that nuclear power stations are not a good use of government finances when there are more important things that need to be funded, such as the health service and education. The group felt that nuclear power stations pose a potential risk to the health of citizens and that it is too great a risk to take.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft of a consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement by the participants, and the final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.

The group felt that the government should be investing in renewable energy sources instead, such as wind power and solar power. Nuclear power stations are a target for terrorist organisations, and the potential for a nuclear disaster is too great. However, the group felt that this is not a pressing matter of concern to them personally. Nuclear power stations are not a good use of government finances when there are more important things that need to be funded, such as the health service and education. However, they were prepared to concede that any government funding given to the construction of nuclear power stations is not likely to greatly damage other areas of public spending.
