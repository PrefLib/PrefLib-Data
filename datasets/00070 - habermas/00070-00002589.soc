# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think that police powers go too far in stopping innocent members of the public, if the police were better trained and respected the public more than I may consider it appropriate but at the moment I am against it. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, Drug crime and the detrimental effect it has on our society has been a problem for over 100 years! We need to do more to make our society safer and protect the next generation.  Allowing police to focus on areas where drug dealing is a clear and present problem just makes good sense in terms of use of police time and resources. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, in such known areas police should be able to stop and search people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: If the area is known for it, that residents and the public would likely agree to it, as per the 'police by consent' model.  It may also allow Police to locate other crimes in the area of the drug dealing, such as those carrying weapons, stolen property etc. If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to worry about.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I agree that the police should be allowed to do this. Drug crime and gang culture is getting worse every day and the best way that the police can try to reduce this is to find drug dealers in common areas. If I were in an area that was known for drug dealing, I wouldn't have a problem being searched because I would have nothing to hide and would understand and respect the police for doing such random checks.
