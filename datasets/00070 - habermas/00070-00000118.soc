# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should not reduce its spending on policing as this would affect the crime rate and potentially reduce the amount of confidence in the police force. There are currently issues with police funding and training and the government should increase its spending on policing rather than reduce it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group came to the consensus view that we should not be reducing the money spent on policing but increasing it, in order to ensure our society is better protected. The group felt that there were many societal factors that determined how much money should be spent, however they also agreed that the current amount was not sufficient.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to reducing funding for policing. However, it was recognised that there may be some places where policing is not as high a priority as in others. In these areas it may be possible to reduce funding and use it for other services, provided this is done with extreme care and in consultation with the community. The overall group consensus, however, was that in general, more money should be spent on policing, and in particular, it should be spent on education, training, and equipping of the police force to better fight crime.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, the government should not reduce the amount of money it spends on policing. In some areas of the country this is an essential service and could prove catastrophic if money was reduced. The increase of knife crime in London is just one example of the need for more police in areas of the country.
