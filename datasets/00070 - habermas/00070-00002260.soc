# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe the sale of alcohol in supermarkets on Sundays should be allowed. Sunday is just like any other day, therefore there should be no difference in the sale of alcohol in supermarkets on this day. It would not increase the negative effects of alcohol and people who do not want to buy alcohol on this day will not be forced to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the sale of alcohol in supermarkets on Sundays should be allowed. This is because it is not a day that is set aside for religious observance in the UK and so should not be treated any differently to any other day of the week. However, it is important to ensure that there are sufficient laws in place to protect the vulnerable and ensure that alcohol is not sold to minors.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “We have debated the issue of the sale of alcohol on Sundays in supermarkets and we feel that the sale of alcohol should be allowed in supermarkets on Sundays. We do not feel that the sale of alcohol on Sundays would make a significant difference in the levels of alcohol consumed by individuals on this day. We also feel that prohibiting the sale of alcohol on Sundays would simply lead to alcohol being sold illegally, by those who are seeking to make money on the back of the alcohol ban. We also feel that the sale of alcohol in supermarkets would not lead to people purchasing alcohol specifically for a Sunday and stocking up with the intention of excessive consumption. In our view, the issue of excessive alcohol consumption is more of an issue on Friday and Saturday nights, when people go out specifically to socialise and consume alcohol. We also feel that by prohibiting the sale of alcohol on Sundays would lead to other problems as well, with the potential for people to turn to illegal sources of alcohol, and thus cause an increase in illegal alcohol consumption. We therefore feel that it is in the best interest of society that the sale of alcohol on Sundays should be permitted in supermarkets.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, we believe that the sale of alcohol in supermarkets on Sundays should be allowed. This is because, firstly, it is not our place to dictate to people what they should and should not do on a Sunday. Secondly, banning the sale of alcohol on Sundays would not prevent people from drinking on that day, it would just make it more difficult for them to do so. Thirdly, banning the sale of alcohol on Sundays would not prevent alcohol-related harms such as domestic violence or drink driving. In fact, it could make these problems worse by making people buy alcohol in bulk before the shops close on a Sunday. Finally, banning the sale of alcohol on Sundays would not stop alcohol-related harms from occurring on other days of the week.
