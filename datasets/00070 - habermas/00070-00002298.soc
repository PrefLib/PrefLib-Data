# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A four day workweek would be a good idea for some professions but not all. The idea of a four day workweek is a good one, however, it would be difficult to implement in all professions. It would be beneficial to employees in terms of work life balance and increased happiness and health. However, it would be difficult to implement in professions where there is a high level of customer service required. It would also be difficult to implement in professions where the work is not office based and is not in an environment where the employee can easily control their workload.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: A four day working week would be a good idea. From current research in which companies have trialled this they have seen increased productivity. It would also be a good way of enhancing an employees work life balance which would decrease the instances of sick leave through stress or other mental incapacities. However, it is important to note that this would not work in all professions, and that it may not be the best option for small businesses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that a 4-day working week would be beneficial to most employees. It would help people achieve a better work-life balance, be beneficial for their health and wellbeing and help reduce stress and anxiety. However, it would not be possible for everyone to work a 4-day week. There are some professions where people work shifts and weekends and it would be very difficult for them to change their hours. There are also some professions where people work very long hours, and reducing the hours to 4 days may not be feasible. It would be very difficult for some companies to implement this change, as it would mean employing more people, which is something some companies may not be able to afford.
