# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We agree that it is very important to save energy and recycle resources in order to minimise the negative impact on the environment. We believe that this will help to protect the planet for future generations. We believe that each individual has a role to play in this effort, and it is something that all individuals, businesses and countries should be taking seriously.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is important to save energy and recycle resources. We all need to play our part and think about our future, and the future of our children and grandchildren. It is a fact that we need to change how we live and that includes conserving energy, recycling and ensuring we are not a burden on the planet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is important to save energy and recycle resources in order to preserve the planet and minimise the effects of climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While the importance of saving energy and recycling resources is well recognised by all of us, the implementation of such schemes in a way that all people can be involved in is essential to ensure that saving energy and recycling resources is something we all do without realising it. By being a natural part of everyday life it becomes something that we don't even have to think about and can benefit from without even knowing it. If such schemes are made to be for the elite, or require extensive personal effort and planning then they will have little effect. We are looking for something that requires little effort from all of us, yet has a great impact for all.
