# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that non-UK citizens should be allowed to vote in local elections. However, we believe that they should have lived in the UK for at least two years and have contributed to society in some way, whether that be through paying taxes, working or volunteering. We believe that this will help to create a more cohesive society and will also give people a sense of belonging. It will also help to increase voter turnout as it will encourage more people to vote, especially those who are less likely to vote, such as young people. We also think that it is important to remember that the people who are voting are living in the UK and therefore have a vested interest in making the UK a better place to live.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We generally agree with the idea of allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections, providing that they have lived in the UK for a certain amount of time. This would be a positive step towards creating a more inclusive society, where everyone is valued and has a say in how things are run. It was also felt that non-UK citizens would be more in touch with UK citizens than those in government and would therefore be more likely to make the right decisions for the community. However, it was also felt that there would need to be strict rules in place to ensure that only those who have lived in the UK for a certain amount of time would be allowed to vote. This would ensure that those who vote are more likely to have a vested interest in the wellbeing of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections. It was felt that this would be a positive step towards creating a more inclusive society, where everyone is valued and has a say in how things are run.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections. The group felt that if a person has been living in the UK for a reasonable period of time, they should be allowed to vote in local elections. The group felt that it is important for a community to be cohesive, and allowing non-UK citizens to vote in local elections would help achieve this. The group also felt that it would be a good way to make non-UK citizens feel more included and more a part of their local community. The group also felt that it would be a good way to help integrate non-UK citizens more into their local community. However, the group felt that it would be important to set strict rules for how this would work. The group felt that non-UK citizens should be allowed to vote in local elections after a certain period of time living in the UK. The group felt that this period of time should be around 12 months. The group felt that non-UK citizens should also be allowed to vote in local elections if they work in the local area. The group felt that this would help to ensure that non-UK citizens are more integrated into their local community and more familiar with the issues facing their local
