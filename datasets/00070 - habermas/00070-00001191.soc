# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Divorce should be made easier in the UK. The current divorce process is too long and complicated. This is not to say that divorce should be made too easy, as this could lead to frivolous divorces. However, the current divorce process is too long and complicated, and this should be addressed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While the decision to divorce is an extremely important one and we recognise that some may require a lengthier process to ensure that the decision is reached in a responsible manner, we believe that divorce in the UK should be made easier in most situations. In particular we believe that where domestic violence is a factor the divorce process should be made much quicker. In general, we think that if one of the two people in a marriage or a relationship wants to end the relationship, they should be able to do so easily.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of making divorce easier in the UK. There was some debate around whether divorce should be made easier for all or whether it should be made easier for certain circumstances. The group came to the consensus view that divorce should be made easier for all, but with a caveat that there should be a longer cooling off period. This would allow couples to have more time to reflect on their decision to divorce and to try and resolve any issues. The group felt that divorce should be made easier for all, but that it should be made harder to get married. The group felt that people should be made more aware of the commitment they are making when they get married and that they should be made more aware of the consequences of divorce. The group felt that divorce should be made easier for all, but that it should be made harder to get married. The group felt that people should be made more aware of the commitment they are making when they get married and that they should be made more aware of the consequences of divorce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is the opinion of the group that divorce is not a simple thing to go through, and as such, the law around it should not be changed to make it easier. It is also the opinion of the group that divorce is an important part of the social fabric and that some consideration needs to be made for the importance of having a stable family unit for children. As such, we feel that divorce law should remain as it is.
