# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should not convert to the euro. There is no clear benefit to the UK, and the change could have negative impacts. The UK is currently doing fine with its own currency and should not change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There is no strong argument for switching from pounds to euros and doing so would cause unnecessary confusion. The pound is not in a good place at the moment, but the euro is not in a much better place. The UK should not switch to the euro.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was against the idea of switching to the Euro, as this would lead to a potential increase in prices, as seen in Ireland. The group also noted that the idea of switching currencies would not have been considered prior to Brexit, so would not be a good idea now. The group did note that the pound is not doing very well at the moment, but the Euro is not doing much better, so there is no clear winner. The group also noted that the current system works fine for the UK, and there would be no real benefits to switching.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was not in favour of switching to the Euro. The reasons were as follows: It would be too difficult to convert everything to Euros, and the conversion rate would not be beneficial for the UK. Also, the UK would be at the mercy of the value of the Euro, which is not necessarily more stable than the pound.
