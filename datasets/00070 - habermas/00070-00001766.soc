# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the royal lineage should be open to people of all backgrounds and not only the current royal family. This is because the royal family is an outdated institution and it is time for a change. However, this is a tricky issue as there is no clear way to decide who would be 'worthy' of a place in the royal family. The monarchy has a lot of power still over decisions made by the UK, so having more diversity of voice within the group would be helpful. However, so much of what makes the royal family respected and powerful is their heritage and the legacy of their forefathers. This is why the royal lineage should be open to people of all backgrounds and not only the current royal family, but it is not an easy issue to resolve.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Consensus statement reached: In general, the royal lineage should be open to people of all backgrounds and not only the current royal family.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Final consensus statement: A middle ground seems to be a good conclusion. A test for people marrying into the royal family could be a good thing to ascertain if that person is worthy. The royal family is a much loved institution in the UK but it is definitely time for it to change and move with the times. There are ways to change the royal family without losing its heritage, and therefore respect, and the royal family should be open to change in order to make it more modern and relevant to society in the 21st century.
