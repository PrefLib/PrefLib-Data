# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should not increase the size of the armed forces, as there is no looming threat that needs more military force.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should maintain the current size of the armed forces.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the size of the armed forces.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The armed forces should not be increased in size. The military is no longer the main tool for diplomatic relations and cooperation, and military aggression is an outdated method of resolving conflict in a modern world. The UK has recently demonstrated that it has no need for a larger military, and instead is focused on maintaining its standing within the international community by peaceful means. Any assets that could go towards the armed forces should go to more important things instead, such as the NHS.
