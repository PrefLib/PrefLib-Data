# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the government is not doing enough to protect us from climate change. While they have made a lot of lofty promises in regards to the environment, this has not been followed up with policies that will lead to a reduction in emissions. The UK is still one of the most polluting countries in the world, and it is the government's responsibility to implement policies that will reduce emissions. Additionally, it is not a case of the government not being willing to implement these policies, but more of the government not putting in place policies that will actually lead to a reduction in emissions. An example of this can be seen in the way the government has approached recycling. While they have put a lot of policies in place that have led to significant increases in recycling, this is not the result of the government's policies, but rather a result of the way in which the public has responded to these policies. The government should be taking the initiative in these matters, and their failure to do so means that the government is not doing enough to protect us from climate change. Discussion The method that was used to reach a consensus view was clearly effective in achieving its goals. The group came to a consensus view that was a reflection of the opinions of the
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, the government is not doing enough to protect us from climate change. While the government has put in place some good policies, such as introducing an energy efficiency scheme, they have not been followed through with enough vigour. It is a case of the government putting in place a lot of good policies, but not really implementing them properly. This has been seen with the way the government has approached recycling. While they have put a lot of policies in place that have lead to significant increases in recycling, it is clear that the public is willing to recycle more, and these increases have not come from the government's policies. Additionally, I think that the government could be doing more to incentivise the use of green energy and energy efficiency measures. While the UK has taken a step in the right direction, the government has to put in place a lot more policies that will actually be implemented and that will lead to reductions in emissions if we are to meet the government's carbon neutral target for 2050.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government has implemented a number of policies to tackle climate change, however, these have not led to sufficient emissions reductions and need to be backed up by more forceful policies. The government needs to do more to encourage recycling and should take more drastic steps to make recycling mandatory in every household and business. The government has also been too slow to incentivise the use of green energy, and green energy is still very expensive compared to the fossil fuels that are being used now. This needs to change if we are to reduce our emissions and meet the government's target of being carbon neutral by 2050.
