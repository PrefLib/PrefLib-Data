# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Parent should have the option to choose for their children to receive surgery to improve their hearing. The ultimate goal is to allow the child to hear well enough to communicate effectively and efficiently with their parents and others. Children should also be allowed to learn sign language, however they should also be allowed to undergo surgery if they would like to. They should be able to choose both options if they wish, but ultimately the parents should have a say in whether their child is allowed to undergo surgery.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Parents should be given the option to have their deaf children's hearing restored with surgery, but should also be made aware of the potential risks involved.  Surgery is not a magic fix, and may not result in the complete restoration of hearing that the parents may imagine.  The child may still need to use other forms of support and communication, and may still need to be part of a deaf community.  Surgery may not be suitable for all deaf children, and parents should be given a range of options for their deaf children, and should never be forced into one avenue (eg surgery) because of lack of access to others (community and social support, signing, other adaptive aids).  Surgery should be offered as just one of these many options.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should be given the option to have their hearing restored with surgery. This is because deafness is a disability and the child will have a better quality of life if they can hear. However, parents should also be given the option to have their child’s hearing restored with surgery, and the option to not have the surgery, so that they can make the decision that is best for their child.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the parents of deaf children should be offered the option of surgical restoration of hearing in their child.  However, surgery is not suitable for all children, and is only one of a range of options that may assist the child to live a normal life.  Surgery will not make the child a hearing child, but will assist in communication, language and social development.  There are pros and cons to surgery, but all children should have the opportunity to learn and communicate effectively with their parents, their peers, and the world around them.
