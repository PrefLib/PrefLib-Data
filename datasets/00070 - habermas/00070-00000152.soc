# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the UK has the moral responsibility to help poor people in other countries. As one of the richest countries in the world, we have the ability to provide assistance to those who are in dire need of it. However, the UK is also made up of people who are in need of assistance. This means that the government should allocate its money for aid, equally, and by making the poorest people in our country their first priority.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should help the poor in our country first. However, once we have done this, we can then help poor people in other countries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although it is a moral responsibility for the UK to help poor people in other countries, we should first take care of the poor people at home before we can take action abroad. Once the problem here has been somewhat settled could we then think about other countries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: After a lengthy debate, we feel that the UK should focus on helping those in the UK first before helping those abroad. We are one of the richest countries in the world, and we should try to fix things here before we move to others.
