# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While the legalisation of public nudity is controversial, there are strong arguments both for and against. Our group believes that women should be allowed to go topless on the street. In our opinion, there is no significant difference between a man being topless and a woman being topless. A man's body is not sexualised in the same way that a woman's body is. Men are not subjected to the same restrictions as women. If women were allowed to go topless on the street, this would help to normalise women's bodies and end the sexualisation of women's bodies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should be allowed to go topless on the street. This is a freedom that we should be allowed to have.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should be allowed to go topless on the street. If people are comfortable with their bodies, then they should be allowed to go topless. It is natural to be nude and there is nothing wrong with that. It is not a problem for men to be topless, so why should it be for women? There is nothing wrong with breasts, they are a natural part of the body. The only reason why women are not allowed to be topless is because of societies opinions. However, if women are comfortable with their bodies, then they should be allowed to be topless. It is a personal choice and should be respected.
