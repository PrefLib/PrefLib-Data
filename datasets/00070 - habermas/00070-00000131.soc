# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should make divorce harder. The strength of the relationship is of paramount importance and should be the focus of people entering the union. By making divorce harder we are valuing the sanctity of the relationship and showing that it is something to be valued.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, divorce is already hard enough. The financial cost, emotional cost, and impact on children should be enough to deter any one who is thinking about divorce. However, it is unfair to force people to stay in a marriage that is dangerous, toxic, and causing problems in their life and the life of their children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of divorce being made harder. However, it was recognised that there may be some exceptions to this. For example, if a person is in an abusive marriage, they should be allowed to get out of it as soon as possible. However, if the marriage is a non-abusive one, then divorce should be made harder, as divorce is usually a last resort after everything else has failed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although divorce is a heartbreaking experience for all parties involved, we do not believe that we should make the process harder, due to the fact that some people who are in abusive and toxic relationships may find it harder to get out, therefore putting themselves in a dangerous position.
