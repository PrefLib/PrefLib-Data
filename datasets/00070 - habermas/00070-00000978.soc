# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Climate change is a very serious issue and will have really bad effects in the future. There isnt enough information being spread around and we are still extremely reliant on fossil fuels. The uk should be focusing more on renewable energy and putting in policies to reduce climate change and our carbon footprint.  There will be really extreme consequences otherwise.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK is doing enough to reduce the effects of climate change. However, the UK can only do so much alone, reducing the effects of climate change requires all countries to work together to make any sizeable impact. Unfortunately, perhaps due to the UK leaving the European Union, the extent of the countries' impacts do not go as far as they perhaps aim to at the policy creation stage, therefore limiting the implementation of such provisions. Therefore, in order to be doing enough, the UK perhaps needs to stop looking inwardly and start reaching out internationally to form relationships with countries whom together they can make real change and impact.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Climate change is the most existential challenge facing the population of the word at the moment, and therefore finding ways to tackle this is absolutely essential for numerous future generations of people, and animals. Much of the damage that has been caused, has been post-industrial revolution, which is almost 200 years ago now, and the damage has been ramping up since then, with the extraction of fossil fuels and the over-reliance on the internal combustion engine. I'm not suggesting we abandon technology, but we must urgently update our way of thinking, and begin to repair the damage we have done to our ecosystem, because without a healthy ecosystem, mankind cannot survive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the United Kingdom is doing enough to reduce the effects of climate change. There are many policies in place, and many being created to reduce the effects of climate change, but the UK can only do so much alone. This is because climate change is a global issue, and therefore requires global solutions. However, the UK can lead the way in reducing the effects of climate change, and in doing so can encourage other countries to follow suit.
