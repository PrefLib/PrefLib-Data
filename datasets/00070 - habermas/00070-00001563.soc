# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: In general, the group was against the practice of asking applicants about their previous salary. However, it was recognised that this practice is very common and that it is often necessary for employers to have some knowledge of the salary expectations of applicants in order to make a job offer. Therefore, it was concluded that it is acceptable for employers to ask applicants about their previous salary, but that it should not be the only factor that is taken into account when making a job offer. Furthermore, it was thought that it would be preferable if the employer would always provide a salary range, or an indication of the salary that the role is designed for. In this way, the employer provides a range of expectations that will guide applicants, but that are not absolute and allow some flexibility for negotiation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was against the practice of asking applicants about their previous salary. However, it was recognised that this practice is very common and that it is often necessary for employers to have some knowledge of the salary expectations of applicants in order to make a job offer. Therefore, it was concluded that it is acceptable for employers to ask applicants about their previous salary, but that it should not be the only factor that is taken into account when making a job offer. It was also agreed that it would be more helpful to applicants if employers were to advertise the salary that would be offered for a particular job, rather than expecting applicants to provide this information in their application. This would make it easier for applicants to know whether they are eligible to apply for a particular job, and would also help to avoid the possibility of applicants being asked to work for a salary that is lower than what they expect.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We generally agree that it is not acceptable for employers to ask applicants about their previous salary. However, it is recognised that this is a common practice and that it can be a necessary part of the hiring process. Therefore, it is concluded that it is acceptable for employers to ask applicants about their previous salary, but that it should not be the only factor that is taken into account when making a job offer.
