# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the government should support cultural organisations. This is because they allow people to express themselves and come together as a community. Culture is also an important part of people's lives and can be a source of happiness and inspiration. However, this support needs to be balanced with other governmental priorities and should not be a top priority in times of crisis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Cultural organisations are important for society and for people to explore the arts. They allow visitors to regions to see local arts which in turn will bring money into the economy, therefore the government should support this. However, this needs to be balanced with the current economic climate of the country and money used to support cultural organisations should not be prioritised over more pressing concerns such as cost of living and rising fuel costs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Cultural organisations should be supported by the government as they enrich society. This is particularly important for people in rural areas who may not have access to cultural activities. The government should support cultural organisations in all areas. This will ensure that people from all areas of the country have access to the arts. However, the extent of the support needs to be balanced with other governmental priorities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the government should support cultural organisations as they are important for society and for people to explore the arts. They allow visitors to regions to see local arts which in turn will bring money into the economy, therefore the government should support this. However, this needs to be balanced with the current economic climate of the country and money used to support cultural organisations should not be prioritised over more pressing concerns such as cost of living and rising fuel costs.
