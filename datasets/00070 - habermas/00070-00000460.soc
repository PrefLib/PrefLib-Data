# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to nuclear power plants, with one person being in favour. In general, the argument given was that they are not safe, not environmentally friendly, and that we should be moving away from the use of fossil fuels, so why move back to a different type of fossil fuel.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, they are not good for the environment, and in fact could have a devastating impact. While they are good for energy security, they could lead to environmental damage in the case of an accident.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although nuclear power plants can be a great source of clean energy and can provide us with security for years to come, it can be unsafe if an accident occurs such as at Chernobyl. The environment can also be affected by nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plants also need to be built in a way that they are not an eyesore in an area.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The world is divided on whether nuclear power plants are a good idea or not. We think that it is dangerous to the environment, but nuclear power is an option to provide clean energy and energy security. We believe that nuclear power plants are needed for a short time, but other sources of clean energy will soon be available and the world will be able to move on from nuclear power. It is better than burning coal which pollutes the atmosphere.
