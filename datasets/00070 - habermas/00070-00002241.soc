# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We don't think it is necessary to regulate and monitor personal health data to prevent another global pandemic. There is no evidence to suggest that this would have prevented COVID-19, and the collection of health data would pose a big security risk if the data was leaked. There is also the issue of how this data would be used. We are concerned that this data could be sold to advertisers, enabling them to personalise adverts to align with certain health issues we have. This would be a breach of privacy and an invasion of our personal lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The world was not prepared for the global COVID-19 pandemic, and although there was a lot of information to monitor the virus, there were not enough mechanisms in place to deal with the virus when it spread, however, we should be concerned about how monitoring personal health data might impact people's privacy and trust in governments and the private sector. Anonymised data collection is acceptable, but it's unlikely that this will ever be able to fully protect people's privacy. It may be possible to predict small outbreaks of diseases through analysis of health trends, but this will not prevent a global pandemic. Overall, there are more negatives than positives to monitoring personal health data to prevent another global pandemic. Therefore, we do not think it is necessary to regulate and monitor personal health data to prevent another global pandemic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is not necessary to regulate and monitor personal health data to prevent another global pandemic, because it would not be helpful, and because the accumulation of personal data by the government poses a security risk.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, it is not necessary to regulate and monitor personal health data to prevent another global pandemic. The majority of participants felt that monitoring personal health data was unnecessary and would lead to a future that made them feel uncomfortable. Some participants felt that private data is so accessible and routinely recorded by private organizations that the public should not be concerned with their personal health data being monitored.
