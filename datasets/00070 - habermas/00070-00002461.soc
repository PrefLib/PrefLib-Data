# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of cryptocurrencies as they provide an alternative and relatively safe way to transact electronically online. Its vital to have decentralised methods of payments in the 21st century to ensure we do not feel controlled or manipulated by others. Cryptocurrencies also creates new ways to pay and provides many benefits amongst the upcoming IoT revolution and will allow for almost instantanious payments worldwide. The only thing is that the group thinks that there needs to be a tighter restriction on uses and a governing body to oversee correct procedures. It is also so easy to manipulate the prices of the currency, where unsavoury people con people who don't fully understand the risks involved. The cryptocurrencies should be transparent and should not be anonymous, otherwise they can easily be used for money laundering. In general, the participants believe that cryptocurrencies should not be banned but that there should be tighter restrictions and oversight in order to prevent crimes and to maintain transparency.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of cryptocurrencies. The participants felt that the UK should not ban cryptocurrencies as it limits and restricts choice. It would show that they are trying to centralise money as opposed to giving the people options. There are negatives such as crime on these currencies due to the ability of being anonymous however you can say the same can happen with actual cash. The participants felt that the UK government should not ban cryptocurrencies but instead create a governing body to oversee correct procedures. This would make cryptocurrencies more transparent and accountable. This would also make cryptocurrencies more accessible to the public and would increase the usage of cryptocurrencies. The participants felt that there should be more information on cryptocurrencies and that the public should be made more aware of the benefits of cryptocurrencies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should not ban cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies provide an alternative and relatively safe way to transact electronically online. It is vital to have decentralised methods of payments in the 21st century to ensure we do not feel controlled or manipulated by others. Cryptocurrencies also creates new ways to pay and provides many benefits amongst the upcoming IoT revolution and will allow for almost instantaneous payments worldwide. The UK government should not ban cryptocurrencies but instead create a governing body to oversee correct procedures. This would make cryptocurrencies more transparent and accountable. This would also make cryptocurrencies more accessible to the public and would increase the usage of cryptocurrencies. The UK government should provide more information on cryptocurrencies and make the public more aware of the benefits of cryptocurrencies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Cryptocurrencies can be an alternate method of payment but there should be tighter regulations around the usage. This includes, but is not limited to, restricting use by age, limiting money that can be transferred at a time and having a governing body to make sure that all crypto-transactions are carried out properly.  The reasoning behind this is that cryptocurrencies are very new and as such there are many problems with them. For example, there are high risks of manipulation and crime with them. However, this does not mean that they should be banned. Cryptocurrencies are a new and exciting way to pay for things and it would be a shame to get rid of them. Instead, the problems with them should be addressed and the general public should be educated on the risks involved with cryptocurrencies and how to avoid them.
