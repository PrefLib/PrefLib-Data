# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A minimum wage is a good thing as it is a fundamental human right to be paid fairly for the work you do. However, in our opinion, a minimum wage is a blunt instrument that may have unintended consequences on businesses, consumers and the wider economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The Minimum wage is a good thing but needs to be carefully measured to not negatively impact businesses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the minimum wage is a good thing in principle. However it can also be counterproductive to business. This needs to be carefully balanced. The minimum wage is only part of the answer and should be complimented with welfare benefits and better tax arrangements to support those that are disadvantaged.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The minimum wage is necessary in the UK. However it is a blunt instrument which does not take into account differing costs of living across the country.  It also does not help the self-employed, but is a good starting point to help people out of poverty.
