# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, cigarettes should not be made illegal. The current system of making it illegal to smoke in public places is sufficient. There are many other things that are more dangerous and more addictive than cigarettes that are not illegal. It is a personal choice and people should be free to make that choice. However, the government should do more to help people stop smoking and to deter future generations from ever starting.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While the legalisation of cigarettes would be a welcome step in improving the health of our nation, we do not believe that this would be a viable solution. It would only be the beginning of a whole new set of problems, such as a black market, increased cigarette prices and an increase in the use of counterfeit products, all of which have negative consequences on the nation's health. Instead, we believe that the focus should be on encouraging people to quit smoking and helping those who wish to quit. The smoking ban in enclosed public spaces and outdoor public places such as bus stops and stations, introduced by the government in 2007, was a positive step in helping to make Britain smoke-free, and we feel this should be further encouraged. We also feel that the government should do more to help and advise those who wish to stop smoking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Smoking cigarettes should not be made illegal. It should not be made illegal because you are only taking the right to choose away from people who may want to smoke. It is a personal choice. The government should not interfere in personal decisions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No. Cigarettes should not be made illegal. The health risks of smoking are well known and people should be allowed to make their own choices. If people want to smoke, they should be allowed to do so. However, the government should be doing more to help people stop smoking and to discourage future generations from starting.
