# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not acceptable to hunt wild animals with dogs as it can cause pain and stress to the hunted animal, and the fact that the animal has little chance of escape against the dogs is just wrong. Also, the act of hunting with dogs is classed as a sport and is not fair for the hunted animal, who has no choice in what is happening. This has gone on for many a year and is seen by some as a sport, but there really is too much suffering for the hunted animal, and to cause suffering is to show ourselves to be brutal and poor ethically. We wish humans to be better than this and to have a decent ethical code in our dealings with each other, and we also need to reflect this in our other actions. To fail in this is to teach our children the wrong lessons. Participants were then asked to reflect on the process of arriving at a consensus view and to give their opinion on the value of the consensus statement. Here is a summary of their views: Participant 1: The process was good.I felt the the statement was much less biased than mine. I think the consensus statement is good, a bit more descriptive than mine. It is a fair viewpoint on the matter.Particip

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is not acceptable to hunt wild animals with dogs as it can cause pain and stress to the hunted animal, and the fact that the animal has little chance of escape against the dogs is just wrong. It also risks safety for the domestic dogs being trained to hunt and also risks safety for humans who are against the practices, such as peaceful protesters.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “No wild animals should be hunted by dogs, excepting if the animal is attacking a person or if the animal is destroying or contaminating food destined for human consumption, as has happened with birds destroying crops. In these circumstances the dogs may only be set on one animal at a time and must be called away as soon as the hunted animal has been killed. The hunting of deer by dogs is illegal. Hunting of deer by dogs causes such undue suffering and pain that it is unacceptable even when hunters 'wear the dogs out' to prevent the exhaustion of the prey and slow down the chase. However, the only permitted way of killing deer in Scotland is to use hounds. Other than in cases of 'threatening an assault' or eating crop damage it is wrong to hunt with dogs in the above-mentioned ways. The law should be enforced as best as possible as the brutal attack on defenceless animals and the large amount of suffering that such hunting occasions should be banned. Such hunting is wrong in itself, even without its far-reaching effects on children and young people. This goes to show that cruel practices which cause suffering should not be permitted at all, even if certain people may consider these practices to be '
