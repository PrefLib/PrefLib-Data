# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: spending less on the military can mean more money is spent on the public for things such as education and healthcare. It would also take the pressure off the government. Less funding into the military could also result in less less conflict  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I think that in the current climate it would be more beneficial to focus on the military. This is because we need to protect our countries from the threats that are currently coming out of other places around. I believe that it could be afforded to spread social welfare out more evenly as some people are getting a lot more money than they need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Military is important for our countries defence and public safety. We can not compare both subjects. Social welfare is in crisis with the cost of living crisis and money is is short supply. I would prefer if they were both given a fair amount of money as we must invest in peoples future but we need the military to keep us safe.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: While we shouldn't ignore the need for a powerful military to act as a deterrent, I feel that the vast sums of money it attracts far exceeds it's usefulness, comparative to how the money could be otherwise spent. The social problems in society are clear and I feel that a few hundred million spent on a few updated jets could be better appropriated to facing more 'real' problems in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I believe the government should spend less on the military and more on social welfare. There is currently obviously the war in Ukraine which we should all be mindful of, but the people relying on the state are suffering majorly, and the quality of life in general in the UK is declining. Pay is dropping in real terms and costs are increasing. Something desperately needs to be done about this.
