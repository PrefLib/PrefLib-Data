# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: In general, the group was in favour of offering financial incentives to young people to live and work in rural areas. It was felt that young people should have as much choice as possible about where they live and work, and the range of options for young people is often less in rural areas. The issue was debated at length and several problems with the scheme were raised. Firstly, if young people move to the countryside they may be judged by the older population in these areas for their appearance and dress, and young people may not feel comfortable in this environment. The group also discussed the fact that many young people choose to live in cities because of the greater number of facilities such as shops, nightclubs and bars, and that the younger generation may be reluctant to move to rural areas where these options are limited. After taking into account all of these points, the group felt that the young people should be aware of the problems they could face living and working in a rural area, and should decide for themselves whether these problems would be outweighed by financial rewards.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of offering financial incentives to young people to live and work in rural areas. It was felt that young people should have as much choice as possible about where they live and work, and the range of options for young people is often less in rural areas. The issue was debated at length and several problems with the scheme were raised. Firstly, if young people move to the countryside they may be judged by the older population in these areas for their appearance and dress, and young people may not feel comfortable in this environment. The group also discussed the fact that many young people choose to live in cities because of the greater number of facilities such as shops, nightclubs and bars, and that the younger generation may be reluctant to move to rural areas where these options are limited. However, it was felt that the pros outweighed the cons, and that rural areas could benefit from having a younger generation living in the area. It was also felt that if the financial incentives were removed when the young person reached a certain age, such as 40, then this could be a way of removing the older people from the countryside, which would increase the availability of jobs for young people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of offering financial incentives to young people to live and work in rural areas. However, it was felt that the scheme should be limited to young people who were born in the rural areas, and not those who had moved there from elsewhere. The scheme should be limited to a certain age range, say 16 to 25, and should be designed to encourage young people who might otherwise move to the cities to stay in the countryside. It was felt that the scheme should be designed to prevent the rapid growth of young populations in rural areas which could lead to increased demand for housing and facilities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group was generally in favour of the idea of providing financial incentives to young people to live and work in rural areas. There were several potential problems with the proposal however. One of the problems mentioned during the debate was that some rural areas may have social environments that are not welcoming to young people, who may be judged for their appearance and dress. Another issue was that young people may be reluctant to move to rural areas because the lack of facilities such as shops, nightclubs and bars, and that the younger generation may be reluctant to move to rural areas where these options are limited. Another concern was that a problem may arise if the financial incentives are given to only a select few young people. For example, if a young person receives a financial incentive to live in a rural area and he is awarded this because of their age and the young people who are not awarded this compensation feel that this is unfair, it may cause unnecessary tensions between the young people. Overall, the group was generally in favour of offering financial incentives, but there were a number of different points to take into account which may make it difficult to execute this policy successfully. Conclusions The rural youth study found that young people were unlikely to change their opinion because of the way information
