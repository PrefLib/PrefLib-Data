# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: To some extent yes, I think the sharing of information and knowledge has been important as well as the use of technology that comes with globalisation. It has allowed different countries and cultures to connect and we can learn from each other which is important. However, the dominant culture that is part of globalisation (mostly emanating from the US) I do not agree is necessarily the one that people and other countries should adopt. People should still keep a lot of their original culture and should not feel that they necessarily have to bend to the dominant culture. Difference is what makes the world work sometimes. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes I believe globalization has been a net positive for humanity. By coming together as a world, it has allowed us to develop more rapidly and advance together. This includes working together to fulfill research in a concerted effort (e.g. healthcare treatments and vaccines) which may not have been possible or may have been slower if countries had tackled these issues independently. Furthermore, globalization will have helped third world countries develop quicker than if they had been left to their own devices, in turn improving the quality of life there and helping to resolve issues such as famine and poor sanitation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although, I initially put that i think it has been net negative the debate is quite tricky when it comes to globalization. Technology has brought a wealth of knowledge and safety to many people that benefit extremely from the ability to communicate and trade with other countries. However, the world has become a place where money is such a big factor in many massive decisions that sometimes peoples lives and their happiness is overlooked in order to make a profit. Therefore, I lie somewhere in the middle but see how so many more people have lived of the past 100 years because of technology growth.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I would definitely agree with this statement. Thanks to globalisation each country can trade the goods they produce and the services they offer which they specialise in with other countries around the world which is great for business. It also allowed us to more easily learn about different countries and their cultures by visiting them on holidays which again is great for the people and the local economy. Globalisation has helped us to share progress on development of technologies, vaccines and has ensured that we can help out and protect one another in times of war or natural disasters.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I believe it has been positive for humanity. Trading with countries around the world allows for variety of goods and products and enhances co-operation and entrepreneurship.
