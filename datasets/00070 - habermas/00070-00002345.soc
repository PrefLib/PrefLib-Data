# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, cannabis should be legalised for use by young people. This is because the long term effects of cannabis are not well known and the current research is not conclusive. The current research is often not reliable as the quality of cannabis available to young people is often of very poor quality and often laced with other drugs. The current system of prohibition has not worked, as the young people are still able to get hold of cannabis and are still using it. It would be better to legalise cannabis and allow it to be sold in a controlled manner, with clear labelling of the strength and contents. The young people should be educated about the effects of cannabis and the dangers of driving under the influence. The current system is not working and is not protecting the young people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of legalising cannabis. However, the group was divided on whether it should be legalised for young people. The group felt that cannabis should be legalised for medicinal purposes, but only under the prescription of a doctor. The group felt that cannabis should be taxed, but not to such an extent that it would drive people to use it illegally. The group also felt that it should be sold in licensed premises, but not in the same way as alcohol. The group felt that the quality of cannabis should be tightly controlled, and that it should be sold in small quantities to prevent people from overusing it. The group also felt that it should be sold in non-smokable forms to prevent passive smoking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of legalising cannabis. We all agreed that cannabis should be legalised and taxed in a similar way to alcohol and tobacco. This would allow for the regulation of cannabis, which would allow for a safer and more reliable product. It would also allow for the government to monitor and control the use of cannabis. The group was in favour of allowing young people to use cannabis, however we all agreed that there should be a minimum age of 18 for this. We felt that the minimum age of 18 would allow young people to make an informed decision about cannabis use, and would allow them to be fully aware of the risks involved. We also felt that there should be an age limit of 18 for the purchase of cannabis, as this would prevent young people from obtaining cannabis from an illegal source.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that cannabis should be legalised. This is because it is a relatively harmless drug and can be beneficial to the economy. The long-term effects are not yet known, however the short-term effects are known to be minimal. The legalisation of cannabis would mean that it can be monitored and regulated, and therefore would be safer to consume. The legalisation of cannabis would mean that it can be taxed and this would provide an increase in revenue for the government. This could be used to fund social services. We believe that cannabis should be legalised for medicinal purposes, however it should only be prescribed by a doctor. The legalisation of cannabis would mean that it is not necessary for young people to buy cannabis from dealers on the street. Therefore, it would reduce crime. We believe that the legalisation of cannabis would mean that it would be available to young people. Therefore, we believe that it is important that young people are educated about the effects of cannabis. This would mean that they would be able to make an informed decision.
