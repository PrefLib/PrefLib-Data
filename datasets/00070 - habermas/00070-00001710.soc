# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not the government's responsibility to combat obesity, however it should take more initiative in providing the necessary education and resources for the individual to take on the responsibility themselves. There is a need for further education to be implemented to help people understand that obesity is a problem, and what the consequences are of being obese. This is particularly important for children and young people, as they are most at risk of the detrimental effects of obesity and are the future generation. It is important to educate people about the importance of physical exercise and to be active. Furthermore, it is important that people are educated about the dangers of fast food, and how to make healthier food choices. In addition, this education should be aimed at a range of people, especially those who are most at risk of being obese, including those in lower socio-economic groups.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the public are not doing enough to combat obesity. There is a lack of education on the subject and a lack of motivation to change. It is also difficult to get the right message across without causing young people to have body image worries and resort to eating disorders or tablets to look a certain way. However, we need to try to combat obesity and there are a number of ways in which we can do this. Firstly, we need to limit fast food advertising by companies such as McDonald's. Secondly, we need to try to make fresh food cheaper and easier to make. Thirdly, we need to work with supermarkets to ensure that offers are on healthier food and snacks are not sold next to the tills. We also need to encourage more physical exercise amongst younger people, who will eventually be the role models for their own children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Are we doing enough to combat obesity?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we are not doing enough to combat obesity. More needs to be done to educate people about nutrition and the dangers of obesity. People need to be made aware of the dangers of obesity and the health problems it can cause.
