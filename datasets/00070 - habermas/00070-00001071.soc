# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The United States will never become a military dictatorship in the traditional sense, because that would be overthrown. However, a future dictatorship is most likely to be an idiosyncratic dictatorship, namely that of the charismatic dictator who is popular and uses populism to great effect in giving the illusion of being in control of their own lives, when really he/she will be manipulating society with its own self-indoctrination. In order to prevent this from happening, it is essential that the United States increase government-funded education, as well as allowing media outlets to independently inform society of the new development, and the consequences it will bring. Otherwise, charismatic dictators will use jingoism to their advantage and will be able to implement new laws and influence society to a much greater extent.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is unlikely that the United States will become a dictatorship. If it does, then it would not be the more traditional military dictatorship, but more likely the populist and charismatic dictatorship. It would likely be a charismatic dictatorship under the guise of protecting and fighting for freedom, when in reality, freedom would be significantly decreased.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is unlikely that the United States will become a dictatorship. If it does, then it would not be the more traditional military dictatorship, but more likely the populist and charismatic dictatorship. It would likely be a charismatic dictatorship under the guise of protecting and fighting for freedom, when in reality, freedom would be significantly decreased. Participants rate the temperature in Fahrenheit. Participants read a conversion guide written in Celsius: 0C = 32F and 100% alcohol has a higher temperature than 0C. Participants then have to give the temperature of pure alcohol in Fahrenheit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is a possibility that the United States could become a dictatorship, however it is unlikely. If a dictatorship were to occur, it would most likely not be the traditional military dictatorship, but rather the populist and charismatic dictatorship. This is because the military is highly trusted by a large proportion of the population and there is a risk that the military could be used by a politician to remove all opposition. It is therefore more likely that a dictatorship would occur under the guise of fighting for freedom, when in reality, freedom would be significantly decreased.
