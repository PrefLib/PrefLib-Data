# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think this is a very difficult question to answer. With the presence of globalisation, we are in the time period where we are most connected to the world in terms of technology. The presence of the internet adds anonminity, freedom of expression, access to knowledge and new technology in the world. Yet we have also an increase in problems aswell. It can be used in a malicious and dangerous manner. You are able to spread false information, hate, and there are also existence of predators and other harmful individuals. I think the internet can act as tool on society which can be manuervered to both sides of the spectrum, and it will forever be constantly changing from negative to positive. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The internet has definitely had a negative effect on some parts of society, but it has also been a hugely positive influence as well. In terms of the negative, it has created a place where those who would already feel difficulty in socialising a place where they can hide from others and live their lives in a way that promotes isolation and not learn the skills to be better in social situations. More powerfully though, it has provided a place for criminals to communicate and trade without the scrutiny of law providers, and for people to share negative and harmful opinions on others in relatively anonymity and safety. The positives do, however, far outweigh much of this, helping people to overcome isolation, improving communication and learning, access to information (though this has to said with caution as much of the information available is unreliable and unverified), and providing ways to do business in much cheaper ways that could not be done otherwise. So my answer is yes, but also greatly positive
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I am torn on whether the internet has a negative effect on society.  It has made my life easier in so many ways, you can educate yourself virtually  for free, I can do my banking on line and is great for communicating with my loved ones.  However I do worry that my daughter has easy access to inappropriate materials and the internet is affecting her health due to using it at both home and at school.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The internet has a net positive effect on society. Increased inter-connection between global citizens has helped build social cohesion on many issues and helped us to understand each other better. Financially, the boom of online commerce and improved banking services has added trillions to global GDP. Technology derived from internet use has developed and thrived.   There are negative effects that are starting to show now, particularly in younger generations and those with high screen time. There is considered to be some link to higher social media use and higher anxiety and depression rates. Overall, the positives far outweigh the negatives. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: In some ways yes and in others ways no. People use the internet for good things as well as bad. The issue is, that it is overused, there is fake news on there and it can cause huge conspiracy theories etc to spread quickly. People are also addicted which is not a good thing.
