# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group of participants came to the consensus view that it is wrong for society to give certain people, such as members of royal families, special privileges because of their family status. This is because it is unfair on the people who do not have the same privileges and it is also unfair on the people who have the privileges as they do not get to experience life as a ‘normal’ person. It is also wrong as it is a form of discrimination. The only way that we think that this could be changed is if the people who have the privileges donate the majority of their money to charities and to the people who are less fortunate. This is because then they are not just living their life of luxury and are actually helping people who are less fortunate than them. This would also make the people who are less fortunate feel better about the situation as they would know that the people who are more fortunate than them are helping them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: We have come to the conclusion that it is wrong for society to give certain people, such as members of royal families, special privileges because of their family status. This is because it is unfair on the people who do not have the same privileges and it is also unfair on the people who have the privileges as they do not get to experience life as a ‘normal’ person. It is also wrong as it is a form of discrimination. The only way that this could be changed is if the people who have the privileges donate the majority of their money to charities and to the people who are less fortunate. This is because then they are not just living their life of luxury and are actually helping people who are less fortunate than them. This would also make the people who are less fortunate feel better about the situation as they would know that the people who are more fortunate than them are helping them. This would also help them feel more equal to those who are more fortunate than them as the only difference would be that they would be wealthier than them but that would not affect the way that the people who are less fortunate are treated and would mean that they feel that they have no reason to complain.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is wrong for society to give certain people, such as members of royal families, special privileges because of their family status. All members of society should be treated the same and everyone should have equal opportunities. It would be fairer on society if it was altered so that people who are born into royalty are not given as many privileges as they currently are and that they do not rely on the state to fund their lifestyle. This is because everyone should be able to earn their own living. It would also be fairer on people who are born into royalty, as everyone should experience the real world as opposed to living a life of luxury which does not reflect life outside of the royal family. This means that they will be able to experience society as ‘normal’ people would do. The only way to solve the problem is for royals to donate most of their wealth to charities that would help people who are less fortunate. This is because then they are not just living their life of luxury and are actually helping people who are less fortunate than them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Society should not give certain people, such as members of royal families, special privileges because of their family status. This is because it is unfair on the people who do not have the same privileges and it is also unfair on the people who have the privileges as they do not get to experience life as a ‘normal’ person. It is also wrong as it is a form of discrimination. The only way that we think that this could be changed is if the people who have the privileges donate the majority of their money to charities and to the people who are less fortunate. This is because then they are not just living their life of luxury and are actually helping people who are less fortunate than them. This would also make the people who are less fortunate feel better about the situation as they would know that the people who are more fortunate than them are helping them.
