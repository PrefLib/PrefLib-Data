# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the government should not require all new cars sold to have the latest autonomous driving technology. This is because there are many consumers who remain nervous of the technology, and/ or prefer to drive themselves 'manually.' It is not the government's role to impose self-driving upon its citizens, especially when the technology is still in its nascent stage and safety issues remain unresolved. The consumer should have the choice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of government intervention in this area. Most people thought that it was not the government's role to impose self-driving technology on its citizens. Some people were concerned that this would lead to an increase in accidents, as people may not be ready for this technology, or may abuse it. The group thought that the government should not be involved in prescribing what is defined as latest technology. Some people felt that this would stifle innovation, as car companies would not be able to come up with their own ideas of what is latest technology. Some people thought that this would lead to more expensive cars, as car companies would have to pay for research and development costs. The group thought that it was better to leave it to the market to decide whether there is enough demand for self-driving cars. If there is enough demand, then car companies will manufacture them. If there isn't enough demand, then car companies will manufacture cars without this technology.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should not require all new cars to have the latest autonomous driving technology. This is because consumers will be driving these vehicles and not everyone will be comfortable with the technology and/ or will want to drive 'manually.' Some people may be concerned about safety issues and also some people may feel that the technology is simply too costly. Moreover, the technology is still in its infancy and car companies are competing to produce the best version of the technology, and it is not the government's role to prescribe what the latest technology is. The government should not intervene, and should only encourage and support this technology, and allow the market to determine which technology is successful.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Government should not require all new cars to have the latest autonomous driving technology. Autonomous driving is still in its infancy and not perfected. Its full rollout will require much more testing, especially on complex scenarios, like weather and the urban environment. The government should wait until the technology is more advanced, rather than risk an increase in traffic accidents by a mass rollout before its time.
