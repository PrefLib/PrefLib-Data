# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Our current immigration policy is a complete shambles. Since Brexit, it is far too hard for unskilled workers to obtain a VISA to live and work in the UK and this has led to a huge exodus in unskilled labour. This country relies on unskilled labour for things like fruit picking and social care and we can already see the knock on effects in society for the choices made because of this. The way we tackle illegal immigration is also shocking, many of the processing camps have low standards of living conditions and this campaign to send rejected requests to Rwanda is abhorrent. This government's immigration policy is horrific and needs to be changed asap to a humanistic and empathetic one.

The way we tackle illegal immigration is also shocking, many of the processing camps have low standards of living conditions and this campaign to send rejected requests to Rwanda is abhorrent. The group was also in agreement that there are no safe routes to the UK from wartorn and impoverished nations. This means that people seeking refuge must arrive in the UK via illegal routes, these illegal routes are dangerous and are the reason a significant amount of refugees die on the trip to a safe country. In the UK, migrants are being held in facilities unbecoming of any person and the situation is rapidly turning into a human right issue. This government's immigration policy is horrific and needs to be changed asap to a humanistic and empathetic one.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The current immigration policy is not correct. We need to open up the floodgates and allow the right to asylum to everyone and I think that we should make it easier for people to apply for visas.
