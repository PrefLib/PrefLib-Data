# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of encouraging the sale of electric vehicles by increasing the number of charging points.  It was felt that this would be beneficial for the environment and would also be a good thing for the economy.  The group felt that it was important that the younger generation understood the importance of this and how their choices can positively impact on the environment and their future.  It was also felt that it was important that people were made aware of the pros and cons of electric vehicles and that they were given the opportunity to test drive them.  The group also felt that it was important that the cost of electric vehicles was made affordable for people and that there were adequate charging points available, which were at a low or free of charge to support this.  The group also felt that there should be an opportunity for discounts if others buy cars to support them changing from a petrol/diesel to an electric car.  The group felt that it was important that larger companies promoted the pros and cons of these vehicles and allowed drivers to test these out.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that in order to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, there needs to be an increase in the number of charging points. There is a need for more charging points as this is a major fear amongst drivers. It is essential that the charging points are accessible, inexpensive to use, and easily located. A wider distribution of charging points would make the cost of owning an electric vehicle more competitive with diesel and petrol cars. This would increase the likelihood of electric vehicles becoming the primary source of transport. There is a need for more awareness to be raised about electric vehicles and the benefits that they provide. We believe that the public should be given the opportunity to try these vehicles for themselves to understand the positive benefits that they provide. It is important that incentives are available to allow drivers to make the switch to electric vehicles and that there is enough information about the costs of owning an electric vehicle to support this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should make it a requirement that all new vehicles in a number of years are electric only and that there are sufficient number of charging points widely available.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, we believe that there should be more electric charging points. This is because it will help the environment, and help people to be able to afford to drive. It will also help the economy as it will create more jobs. It will also encourage people to buy electric cars as it will be more convenient for them. It will also help people to be able to afford to drive.
