# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People should be allowed to use social media as much as they want. It is their right to do so, and can be a positive experience for many people. However, we acknowledge that there is a growing social media addiction problem that needs to be tackled. We do not believe that limits on the amount of times a person can access social media is the correct way to tackle the problem. Instead we believe that we should look to educate people on why social media is so addictive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although social media can be a great place for communication, it is becoming more and more apparent that there are a growing number of people who are addicted to social media. This can be damaging to people's mental health, and it can also lead to people becoming more and more isolated from the real world. We do not think that a limit on the number of times a person can access social media in a year would be a good idea, as it would essentially be censorship. Instead, we think that we should educate people on why social media can be addictive, and encourage people to spend less time on social media.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We do not believe that there should be limits to the number of times a person can access social media in a year. People should have the freedom to use social media as much as they like, as long as they are not breaking any rules or laws. The only way we think it would be acceptable to impose limits would be in a situation where a person has been found to have broken rules or laws, or if they are a danger to themselves or others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to putting limits on the number of times a person could have access to social media in a year. The general feeling was that people should be free to access social media as much as they want, and that this is a fundamental right. However, it was also acknowledged that social media can be addictive, and that some people may use it too much. It was agreed that education is the best way to combat this.
