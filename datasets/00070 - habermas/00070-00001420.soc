# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the UK should not have a universal basic income. We believe that it is important to encourage people to work and a universal basic income will lead to more people refusing to work. We also believe that this will lead to a greater divide between the rich and the poor. We believe that the government should continue to provide a minimum wage to ensure that people are paid fairly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While the group are aware that a universial basic income would be beneficial for a lot of people in society, the group believe that a universial basic income would lead to the UK becoming more like a communism state. We are all aware that one of the main principles of communism is that people should receive a wage for their work. This leads to a society in which people have no need to work. If everyone in society was to receive the same wage, regardless of the work they did, we would see a situation where people have no incentive to work. This is bad for society as the UK economy is currently one in which we need to encourage people to work. If we have a universal basic income, then we will be encouraging people not to work and therefore we will be sending the economy into a downward spiral.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: A universal basic income is a good idea in principle, but it is likely to lead to an increase in the number of people who refuse to work. It is also likely to lead to an increase in the number of people who are in poverty, as it will lead to a decrease in the incentive to work. It is also likely to lead to an increase in the number of people who are in poverty, as it will lead to a decrease in the incentive to work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group came to the consensus view that we should not have a universal basic income in the UK, and the reason for this is that it will take away the incentive for people to work. The belief is that we need to encourage people to work and that by providing them with a universal basic income, we will simply be discouraging people from working and incentivising them to take advantage of the system. It is felt that this will lead to a loss of productivity in the UK and will only make the government poorer.
