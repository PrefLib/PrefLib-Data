# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The NHS should not be privatised as it provides healthcare to all who need it regardless of their income. Privatisation of the NHS could make medical care unaffordable for the lower income and lead to a two-tier system. The NHS does need more funding, however this would result in more jobs and is necessary for the future of the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The NHS should not be privatised. The NHS is in desperate need of reform, and additional funding is needed to support the NHS to be able to deliver its services more efficiently and in a cost effective manner. However, the NHS needs to continue to be funded by the taxpayer to ensure that medical care is accessible to all, regardless of their income. The NHS needs reform, but it must be done as a public service, not a private one.
