# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was split down the middle on this question. The group agreed that the answer to this question is subjective and depends on the individual and their situation. The group came to the conclusion that technology is a double edged sword, it has many benefits but also many drawbacks. The group also agreed that we are too reliant on technology in some aspects of life, for example, in a disaster situation where the power grid is down, people would be lost without their phones. The group also agreed that we are not too reliant on technology in other aspects of life, for example, we are not reliant on technology for food, water and shelter. The group agreed that we are becoming more reliant on technology, however, the group also agreed that this is not necessarily a bad thing. The group also agreed that the world would be a very different place without technology and that the world would be a worse place without technology. The group agreed that the world would be a better place if people were less reliant on technology and more reliant on each other. The group agreed that we should be careful about how reliant we are on technology and that we should be careful about how much we let technology control our lives. The group
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, we have come to the decision that we are not too reliant on technology in this day and age. In our opinion, there are many positives to using technology, such as the fact that it can improve our lives in many ways. It is also very useful for businesses and the government as it can make their jobs a lot easier. However, we do think that it is important that we are aware of the negatives of technology and the problems that it can cause. For example, some people become addicted to their phones and are always looking at them, even when they are with other people. This can lead to a lack of communication and a loss of social skills. We also think that people should learn how to do things without technology, such as reading a map. This is because if the technology suddenly stopped working, we would not know what to do. Therefore, we have come to the conclusion that we are not too reliant on technology and that it is important that we are aware of both the positives and negatives of it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea that we are too reliant on technology in the modern age. The group felt that although technology has its benefits, it also has many drawbacks. We are becoming increasingly reliant on technology in our day to day lives, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine a world without it. The group felt that if we were to suddenly lose all of our technology, it would be a very difficult time for society. However, the group also felt that it would be a very interesting time for society, as it would force us to go 'back to basics' and make us appreciate the things that we often take for granted. The group felt that it is important for people to have a basic understanding of survival skills, such as reading a map, in case technology fails. However, the group also felt that it is unlikely that technology will fail completely, and that it is more likely that technology will continue to develop and become even more important in the future.
