# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Austerity is a good economic policy for the UK if the spending cuts are made in the right areas. For example, the spending cuts should not be made in the NHS, as this would reduce the quality of service which in turn would have a knock-on effect on the entire population's welfare, and it could only worsen. Similarly, cuts should not be made on teachers, as this would decrease the country's education standards, which will have an adverse effect on children and young people. Instead, spending cuts should be made in areas where they will have the least effect on people. For example, libraries and parks may be a good place to start, although libraries allow people to study for free and parks provide a space for everybody to exercise in.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Austerity is not a good economic policy for the UK. This is because although there are cuts, these are being made in the wrong places. The cuts are being made in public services which actually need money. For example, cutting money from the NHS, which is already struggling and needs more money, is detrimental to our society. Moreover, these cuts are negatively affecting the poorer members of our society. It is having a bigger impact on the lower classes and making the already unequal society even more unequal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Austerity is a good economic policy for the UK as long as the spending cuts are made in the right areas. For example, spending cuts should not be made in the NHS or on teachers, as this would affect the public most and lead to lower productivity. Instead, cuts should be made in areas where it will have the least effect on people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Austerity is a good economic policy for the UK as long as the spending cuts are made in the right areas. For example, spending cuts should not be made in the NHS or on teachers, as this would affect the public most and lead to lower productivity. Spending cuts should instead be made in areas where it will have the least effect on people. This statement includes some of the critiques of the first draft consensus statement. For example, the statement specifies where the spending cuts should not be made, with reference to the NHS and teachers, and also gives examples of the people who are being impacted the most. It also clarifies the first statement, e.g. 'austerity is good' has been changed to 'austerity is a good economic policy'.
