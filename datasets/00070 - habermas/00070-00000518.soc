# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The BBC should continue to receive funding from the government. The Government funding is used by the BBC to serve the BBC World Service. This provides a valuable source of non-biased news reporting to non-UK countries around the world. An example includes broadcasting in Ukraine during the ongoing war there to combat against Russian misinformation campaigns. Without Government funding, this service would be at risk and would either not be performed at all, or would have to be funded from alternative forms such as via the licence fee which we, the general public, have to pay for.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the BBC is the country's national broadcaster. The BBC's licence fee is paid for by UK residents to be used to support its channels. It is only right that the BBC should continue to receive funding from the government to ensure it continues its services to the UK public. The BBC is not only important to the UK, but is a valuable source of non-biased news reporting to non-UK countries around the world. An example includes broadcasting in Ukraine during the ongoing war there to combat against Russian misinformation campaigns. Without Government funding, this service would be at risk and would either not be performed at all, or would have to be funded from alternative forms such as via the licence fee which we, the general public, have to pay for.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The BBC is a key part of UK culture. It is important to have a well-funded BBC to ensure that the highest quality of programming is produced and that the BBC can fulfil its role of providing a high quality news service to the nation. The BBC World Service also provides a high quality news service to the rest of the world and helps maintain the international reputation of the UK. It is therefore important that the BBC is well funded, whether this is by the government, the licence fee or another source. It is also important that the BBC remains independent of the government and that funding from the government is therefore limited. A fully independent BBC is essential to the democracy of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The BBC should continue to receive funding from the government. This funding is used to allow the BBC to continue to provide news and entertainment to the UK and around the world. It is also used to create programmes which often increase awareness on issues which would not be addressed if not for the BBC. The BBC world service is a valuable tool in spreading information and education around the world and we feel that it would be a loss to the world if it were to no longer receive government funding.
