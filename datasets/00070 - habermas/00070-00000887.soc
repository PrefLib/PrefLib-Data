# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should not raise the age of the state pension to 70.  Raising the state pension age might increase poverty and health issues in the UK public.  People in later life find it difficult to find work anyway so are unlikely to find employment if they don't manage to keep the role they have.  If the age is increased a lot of people would lose the chance to receive their pension as they could die before that.  The only fair choice is to keep the age at 65.  We already work so hard in the UK and 65 is a good age to be able to be rewarded and receive pension.  Asking people to work until they are 70 before they can access state pension means asking them to keep working for 50+ years of their life.  Many people at this age are in declining health and may not be able to continue working their jobs, nor easily be able to change their job at this age to something easier.  If they leave work they must depend on their private pension until 70.  People have a right to enjoy retirement before 70, as after 70 declining health is a much bigger risk.
