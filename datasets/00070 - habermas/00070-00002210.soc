# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “The police should be able to carry guns, but only after they have reached a certain level of training. The world is becoming more and more dangerous and the police are not adequately equipped in this country. The corruption in the police force needs to be tackled. The public need to feel safe.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Police should only be allowed to carry guns after extensive training and a serious background check. The number of innocent deaths caused by the police means that a great deal of caution must be taken when giving police the right to carry a gun. The main priority is public safety, and if the police are not trusted by the public, the situation is unlikely to improve. Police should be required to carry alternatives to guns such as pepper spray or tasers. They should only use their gun when the situation is absolutely necessary and as a last resort.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The police should be armed in order to protect themselves and the public. However, they should be well trained to use guns in the right situation. Alternative tools of defence such as pepper sprays and tasers should also be made available to police.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The police should be able to carry guns, but only after they have reached a certain level of training. The world is becoming more and more dangerous and the police are not adequately equipped in this country. The police should set an example that gun use against people is wrong and should carry other tools of defense. They could use pepper sprays or tasers or tranquilisers instead of guns that can kill people. The police need to be protected and have their own security so they can protect themselves. But I do not think they should carry guns unless they are properly trained in how to use them. Some of them are very trigger happy and have injured or killed innocent people. The corruption in the police force needs to be tackled. The public need to feel safe.”
