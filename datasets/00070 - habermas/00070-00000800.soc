# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People in receipt of benefits should be allowed free bus passes. The benefits system is designed to help people who cannot provide for themselves and as such the government has an obligation to support them. In this way, the government can support people who are trying to better themselves and get back into work by allowing them to travel to interviews and places of work. The bus pass also allows people to travel to see their family and friends and to access services such as the doctor or dentist. The bus pass is a way for the government to provide support to people in receipt of benefits and the wider society as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of people who are in receipt of state benefits being able to get free bus passes. The main reasons for this were that the people who receive benefits are likely to be in a low income bracket and as such would find it difficult to afford a bus pass. If they are able to get free bus passes, they are more likely to be able to afford to travel to work, to access services, and to meet family and friends, and this will ultimately benefit the wider society. It was also noted that it would be beneficial for the bus companies, as they would be getting more people using their services. The group also felt that it was important that the bus companies did not have to incur extra costs in order to provide free bus passes to people in receipt of benefits, as this would be an unfair financial burden on them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People who are in receipt of state benefits should be allowed to get free bus passes. This is because people who are in receipt of state benefits are likely to be living in poverty, and therefore are not in a position to pay for bus travel. As such, it is reasonable for the government to provide a free bus pass, as this allows people to access employment, education and other services that they may not be able to afford otherwise. This is a good idea, as it will allow people to contribute to society, rather than being trapped in poverty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People who are in receipt of state benefits should be able to get free bus passes. The main argument for this is that the people who are on benefits are not in a position to be able to pay for a bus pass. It is an essential part of life to be able to get around and this will help them to be able to do that. It will also help them to get to work and to access the services that they need. The people who are on benefits have to live within their means and so they should be able to access free bus passes. This will also benefit society as a whole as the people who are on benefits will be able to access the services that they need and will also be able to access the jobs that are available to them. This will help society as a whole as the people will be able to access the services that they need and will also be able to access the jobs that are available to them.
