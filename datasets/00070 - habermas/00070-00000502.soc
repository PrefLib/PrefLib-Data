# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in agreement that it should be illegal to use mobile phones while driving as there is no need for it, it is very dangerous and could cause serious injury or death.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While the use of mobile phones can be very dangerous, and should be avoided while driving, it is currently difficult to enforce such a law. There are currently many technologies available to drivers that can provide a safer way of using mobile phones.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL TO USE MOBILE PHONES WHILST DRIVING DUE TO THE RISK OF INJURY AND DEATH”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is the opinion of the group that mobile phones should not be used when driving, because you are not concentrating on the road. There is an obvious danger in using a mobile phone and driving. You should use a hands free kit or some other device. It is also very dangerous because you may be distracted by the phone, so are not concentrating on the road. As a result, this can cause accidents. It is safer to pull over and park up in a safe place and then use your phone. Using the CONSENSUS method of report writing, write a report of approximately 150 words summarising the debate.
