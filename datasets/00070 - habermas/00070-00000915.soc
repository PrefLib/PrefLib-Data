# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of requiring new buildings to be carbon neutral. However, it was felt that the wording of the question was too vague, and that it was unclear what the term "carbon-neutral" actually meant in this context. It was felt that there was a need for more information on what the term "carbon-neutral" actually meant in this context, and also on what the costs of such a requirement would be. It was also felt that the term "carbon-neutral" was too vague, and that it would be more useful to have a specific target for the amount of carbon emissions that new buildings should be allowed to produce. It was also felt that it would be useful to have more information on the likely costs of such a requirement, and on whether these costs would be passed on to the occupants of the building. It was also felt that it would be useful to have more information on what would happen to existing buildings, and whether these would also be required to become carbon-neutral at some point in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of requiring every new building in the UK to be designed to be carbon-neutral. This would be an important step in the fight against climate change. However, there was a concern that the cost of building carbon-neutral would be very high and this would put people off. The group therefore suggested that the government should provide incentives for people to build carbon-neutral, such as tax breaks, to encourage this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea that new buildings should be designed to be carbon-neutral. The group believed that this would be an important step in the fight against climate change. However, the group also believed that it would be unfair to impose this requirement on existing buildings. The group also believed that there should be some flexibility in the requirement, for example if it is not possible to make the building carbon-neutral, then it should be made as carbon-neutral as possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should require all new buildings in the UK to be designed to be carbon-neutral. This is a very important step in the right direction to help combat climate change and the damage it is doing to the planet. This is something that is needed now, not in the future. This will require a lot of work to be done by architects and engineers to make this happen. The government should put more money into research to make this happen as soon as possible.
