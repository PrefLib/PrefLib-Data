# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should have more migrant workers to the UK. There are jobs that need to be done and we cannot find people to fill those vacancies. Migrant workers add to our community. Diversity of cultures make this a more vibrant and interesting place to live. However, we must be careful not to create a 'brain drain'. It is not fair for wealthier countries to poach the best doctors and scientists from less well off countries who are in need of their skills.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the UK has benefited from migrant workers in the past. In the current climate, with high unemployment, we should not be bringing in any more migrant workers. If we have high unemployment, we should be looking to train up our own people first.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of having more migrant workers in the UK. There was a recognition that migrant workers were filling vital roles in the workforce, particularly in the care sector and agriculture. It was also noted that migrants are often prepared to do the jobs that British people don't want to do. The group was also aware that some migrants come to the UK to study, then find it difficult to get a job afterwards. The group was in favour of having more migrant workers, but only if there was a level playing field. This means that they would like to see a situation where UK citizens are prioritised for jobs. However, the group was also aware that this might not always be possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should have fewer migrant workers to the UK. This is because a lot of them are living off state benefits or are illegal immigrants anyway. We should train up our own inhabitants first before bringing in any more migrants. We should also be careful not to create a 'brain drain' by poaching the best doctors and scientists from less well off countries who are in need of their skills.
