# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, the group has decided that cars should not be banned in central London. The group has come to this conclusion for a variety of reasons. The group feels that the government should not interfere in the lives of its citizens in this way. The group feels that banning cars would be an extreme measure and would cause more problems than it would solve. The group also feels that cars are essential to the smooth running of London. The group feels that cars are needed to transport people to and from work and to transport goods around London. The group also feels that cars are needed in emergency situations. The group also feels that banning cars would lead to violent protests and would not be the best way to solve the problem. The group feels that the best way to solve the problem is to educate people on the issues with cars and their emissions and to encourage people to use public transport where possible. The group also feels that cars should be made more environmentally friendly and that the government should invest in cleaner fuels for cars. The group feels that these are the best ways to solve the problem.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While cars should not be completely banned in central London, we do agree that they should be reduced. The increase of electric cars should be encouraged and incentives provided by the government to support this. Taxis should be required to become electric in order to operate in the centre of London. We also suggest that congestion charges be introduced to make cars an unfavourable option in the centre of London. We are also in agreement that the general public should be educated as to the impact of pollution caused by cars in London.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We do not believe that a complete ban on cars in central London would be a positive thing to do, as it would be too disruptive and would force too many people to find new ways to travel which could not be implemented quickly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No. We don't think cars should be banned in central London. We believe that it would cause more harm than good. It would lead to people finding alternative methods of transport which could be even more harmful to the environment and it would also lead to a loss of jobs.
