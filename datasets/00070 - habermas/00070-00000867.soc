# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should not be more like the US as the US have a lot of problems due to guns. The US's gun law is completely wrong and I feel that the US lives in the past - in terms of racism and principles. The US is reducing the rights of its citizens, particularly women, and there is a lot of poverty due to the bad social and health care systems that create debt cycles people can't get out of. There is also more fanatical religious beliefs.  As quality of life is going down in the US, not only because of poverty and poor governing but also because of obesity and health problems, we should not be more like the US.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK should not be more like the US.  The US has a lot of problems due to guns, their laws seem crazy and gun crime is a scary thing.  The US is reducing the rights of its citizens, particularly women, and there is a lot of poverty due to the bad social and health care systems that create debt cycles people can't get out of.  Gun violence is widespread and there is a lot of extremist thoughts among people in the US.  As quality of life is going down in the US, not only because of poverty and poor governing but also because of obesity and health problems, we should not be more like the US.  The UK is a very strong country in our own right with the right morals and principles.
