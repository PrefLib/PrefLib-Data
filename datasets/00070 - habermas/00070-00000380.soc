# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we should not build new nuclear power plants. It is very likely that nuclear power plants are a more efficient and cheaper source of electricity. It is also true that they produce lower emissions of CO2 compared to coal and fossil fuels. However, they do have some severe downsides such as: the risk of meltdowns; cost of building and maintaining the plants; and the difficulty of disposing of nuclear waste. There are also ethical issues surrounding nuclear power - we should not be using it at the expense of our future generations and the use of nuclear power raises an issue of equity - should poorer countries be able to afford nuclear power plants?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should not build new nuclear power plants. The positives of nuclear power (more efficient, cheaper, reduced CO2 emissions) must be weighed up against the negatives (risk of meltdowns, cost of building, disposal of nuclear waste). There are other alternatives such as wind and solar energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we should not build new nuclear power plants. It is very likely that nuclear power plants are a more efficient and cheaper source of electricity. It is also true that they produce lower emissions of CO2 compared to coal and fossil fuels. However, they do have some severe downsides such as: the risk of meltdowns; cost of building and maintaining the plants; and the difficulty of disposing of nuclear waste. There are also ethical issues surrounding nuclear power - we should not be using it at the expense of our future generations and the use of nuclear power raises an issue of equity - should poorer countries be able to afford nuclear power plants? In addition, it has been noted that other forms of energy, such as wind and solar power, may be better options for the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There is a strong argument for building new nuclear power plants as they are very likely a more efficient and cheaper source of electricity. However, the risks of meltdowns; the cost of building and maintaining the plants; and the difficulty of disposing of nuclear waste are all very serious concerns. Furthermore, if poorer countries were to start building nuclear power plants - this could cause an environmental catastrophe due to the lower safety standards.
