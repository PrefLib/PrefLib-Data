# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of people eating meat. However, the group also agreed that the consumption of meat should be reduced and that people should be more aware of the impact of their diet on the environment. The group also agreed that lab grown meat could be a viable alternative in the future, but that it is currently too expensive to be a realistic alternative.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of people eating meat, but with the caveat that it should be done in moderation. There was also an agreement that the way in which meat is produced needs to change, with a move towards more sustainable farming practices.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While the science of nutrition is an extremely complex one and we recognise that some people may not be able to have a plant-based diet due to health reasons, we believe that as a society, we should be trying to eat less meat. In particular, it is important that we should be moving away from factory farmed meat, where animals are kept in inhumane conditions. This can be done by choosing to buy organic, free-range meat from small, local farms and by choosing to eat more vegetarian or vegan meals, even if it is only once a week.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is fine to eat meat, but for those who do, they should try to reduce their consumption, and try to buy from local farmers and producers as much as possible. It is also important to acknowledge the meat that we do eat, and show respect for the animals that gave their lives for our consumption.
