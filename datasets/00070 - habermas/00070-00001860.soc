# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We agree that the voting age should be 16, however we are not sure if this would actually make any difference as it is hard to know if people would actually turn up to vote at the polling stations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the voting age should be lowered to 16. We believe that the right to vote is a basic human right and that this should be extended to 16 year olds. We also believe that 16 year olds are often more informed on the key issues than elderly people who are stuck in their ways and are not up to date with the real state of the world right now. 16 year olds are already expected to have a lot of responsibility and this should be reflected in their right to vote. We believe that this will increase the number of people voting and make the government more representative of the population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We all agreed that the voting age should be 16 but there was a long discussion about the fact that it is difficult to judge people's level of knowledge and maturity, particularly as these are not age dependent. Also, the reasons for the way someone votes can be for any number of reasons. We agreed that education is important and that it is a great way to get people involved in voting.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that 16 year olds should be allowed to vote. This is because they are more aware of the current issues in society and are more likely to vote.
