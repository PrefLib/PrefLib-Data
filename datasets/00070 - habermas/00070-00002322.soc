# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the government should spend more on improving the railway network. The current railway network is not adequate to meet the needs of the population. There is a need for more lines and more trains, especially in rural areas. The government should also ensure that the railway network is more efficient and reliable. This will require investment in new infrastructure and rolling stock. However, the current economic climate means that the government should be careful about where it spends its money. Therefore, the government should consider whether the railway network is the best place to spend money at the moment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the government should spend more on improving the railway network. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the current network is old and outdated and needs investment to improve the quality of the service. Secondly, the current network is privatised and as such, the private companies are not incentivised to invest in improving the network. Thirdly, the current network does not adequately serve rural areas. This is a problem that needs to be addressed. Finally, the current network is not environmentally friendly. This needs to be addressed by the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the government should spend more on improving the railway network. It is an essential part of the public transport system and one that is used by a large number of people. The railway network is also an important part of the economy, transporting goods around the country. The railway network is currently not adequate, with some areas being left out of the network and some areas having an inadequate service. There is also a need to improve the quality of the railway network, with trains being late or cancelled and strikes causing disruption. The railway network should be improved to make it a more reliable form of transport that people can use instead of their cars.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “The government should spend more on improving the railway network. The current railway network is not fit for purpose and requires a lot of investment. It is not good enough to be encouraging people to ditch their cars if there is no adequate public transport for them to use. The recent rail strikes have shown how people with no other form of transport are really put in difficulty in these situations. The government should improve the tracks already in place and build new, additional tracks so that rural areas are better served. A focus on providing and maintaining good public transport is key if people are to become less reliant on their cars (which I think is incredibly important due to the ongoing climate emergency).”
