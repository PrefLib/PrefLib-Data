# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - One reason against cutting corporation tax is that the UK national debt is quite high and the tax income needs to be maintained or increased. A reason against is that a lot of small and medium sized businesses are struggling post covid, and a lot are closing down so any relief would help new growth. Added to that factors such as cost of living crisis and high inflation mean that it is very difficult to run a business in UK nowadays.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I do not know a lot about corporation tax but I believe the implications would be more investment by businesses and hopefully a boost for jobs and the economy.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I feel like I do not know too much about this topic. But I think that corporations probably pay a lot of tax, so possible some cuts may benefit them, especially with high inflations and job cuts, the extra money can help keep their employees.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government already gives enough tax breaks to large corporations, with the excuse that they are providing a lot of jobs. But the government is providing subsidizations by proxy as the the people these jobs for large corporations are barely paid a living wage therefore causing them to require to claim benefits to survive. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I don't think there is a need to cut corporation tax. It could be argued that you would attract more businesses here if you did. However, the UK is not as attractive a site for business as it used to be due to increased bureaucracy as a result of Brexit so fewer businesses are likely to come. I think cutting tax would not increase the number of businesses here sufficiently to increase tax revenues.
