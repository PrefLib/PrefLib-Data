# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It was agreed that the packaging should be biodegradable and made from recycled material. Plastic is not sustainable or environmentally friendly so should be replaced with another product. Single use containers are good for people on the go but we need to make a conscious effort to reduce the amount of waste produced and make products that are easy to recycle and reuse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should reduce the amount of single-use food containers and where possible we should replace these with biodegradable and sustainable alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the use of single-use food containers should be reduced as much as possible. We believe that this can be achieved by encouraging businesses to move to sustainable and biodegradable alternatives to single use plastic. We also believe that the use of single use food containers should be banned in instances where the use of such containers is not necessary. For example, we believe that takeaway restaurants should be encouraged to move to biodegradable containers, and that the use of single use plastic food containers should be banned in instances where the use of such containers is not necessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Single use food containers should not be banned but should be made from more sustainable materials.
