# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the growing of cannabis for medicinal use should be allowed but we agree that in most cases, it is a recreational drug. We understand that people use it to self-medicate for various conditions but are aware of the dangers and side effects of its use. It is reasonable for people to grow it in a large garden if it doesn't bother anyone else, and for their own personal medical use, but not for recreational use. We are opposed to it being normalised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should not be allowed to grow cannabis plants in their gardens. If they really need to use it for medicinal purposes, then they can go to their local pharmacy. The smell is so strong and powerful, it spreads to neighbouring gardens and will probably annoy people who do not want to smell it. Also, the laws are in place for a reason, so we do not want to make it too easy to access cannabis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Cannabis has been proven to be medicinal. However it is a very potent smell and has negative effects on mental health. If it were to be legalised for growing then it would have to be enforced that it could only be grown in the back garden where the smell would not offend others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People should be allowed to grow their own cannabis plants for recreational purposes, however we do not think it should be legalised as an entirely legal drug. This is because of the significant dangers to health of smoking cannabis, especially for young people. We believe that the medicinal use of cannabis has the most benefits and could be of help to some people.
