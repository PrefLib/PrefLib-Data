# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Artificial sweeteners in drinks can be good for people who have diabetes, because they can drink them too. But if you do not have problem with sugar, artificial sweeteners will not benefit you. It is the moderation of sugar what should be achieved.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There are healthier options out there that are not artificially sweetened. Even those who have diabetes should choose to stay away from artificial sweeteners. I would like to thank all the participants for a very fruitful and positive experience. The views expressed above are their own.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Diabetes is a growing problem in the Western world. For people with diabetes, artificial sweeteners in drinks can be a good option. There are alternatives for people who are not diabetic, as for example mixing fruit juice with water to compromise.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Some artificial sweeteners can be a healthy alternative to sugar for people with diabetes. However, for others, sugar is more healthy. This was a difficult topic for participants to reach a consensus view on, but after much deliberation they did come to a consensus view.
