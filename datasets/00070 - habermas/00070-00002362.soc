# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In principle, it is a good idea to give all children a free computer at the age of six. This would help to level the playing field, and ensure that all children have the same opportunity to access the internet and use a computer. However, it would need to be means tested, so that the children at the greatest economic disadvantage would benefit from a free computer. Realistically, this would need to include free or subsidised broadband at home for the children to be able to access material for education. It is also important to ensure that children are supervised when using the computer, and that they are not exposed to unsuitable material.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the idea of giving children a free computer at the age of 6 is a good one. The benefits of doing so would include giving children the opportunity to use a computer for their education, including learning important technical skills. However, the idea should perhaps be means tested, so that the children at the greatest economic disadvantage should benefit from a free computer. Realistically, this would need to include free or subsidised broadband at home for the children to be able to access material for education. It is also important to note that at the age of 6, children should still be encourage to have free play outside instead of being on a computer. Therefore, it is important that the children are supervised when using the computer and that the use of the computer is monitored.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In principle, it is a good idea to give all children a free computer at the age of six. This would help children to get to grips with technology and it would also help them in their education. However, there are practical difficulties with this idea. It would be very expensive and it is not clear where the money would come from. It would also need to be accompanied by free or subsidised broadband access for the children to be able to use the computer. Another problem is that six is a very young age for children to be given a computer and it would be difficult to ensure that the children were supervised and that they were not accessing inappropriate material.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the idea of giving children a free computer at the age of 6 is a good one. The benefits of doing so would include giving children the opportunity to use a computer for their education, including learning important technical skills. However, the idea should perhaps be means tested, so that the children at the greatest economic disadvantage should benefit from a free computer. Realistically, this would need to include free or subsidised broadband at home for the children to be able to access material for education. The issue of ensuring that children are not on the computer all the time and are still having free play should also be addressed. The idea of providing free computers to children is a very good one, but it is also important that the children are supervised when using the computer and that the use of the computer is monitored.
