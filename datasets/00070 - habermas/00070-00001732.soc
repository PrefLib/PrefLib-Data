# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, a foreign power should not be allowed to buy UK infrastructure, however, in certain instances, this may be beneficial to the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of foreign investment in UK infrastructure, but with some caveats. The group felt that the UK should be able to maintain some control over infrastructure that is vital to the UK, such as water and power, and that foreign investment in these areas should be limited. The group also felt that foreign investment in infrastructure should be limited if it is likely to lead to a conflict of interest, for example if a foreign power owns a large amount of infrastructure and also has a large military presence in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We don't think that it should be allowed, as it would be better for the economy if the UK's infrastructure was kept in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should be responsible for all of its infrastructure and should not be reliant upon outside sources for such things. It can have a negative effect on the economy, and although it is not always bad, it could become dangerous if it was in the hands of the wrong people. There is always the risk that it could be used to control the UK or could be exploited for money. The benefits of having foreign ownership would be the funding and maybe being able to gain a more diverse knowledge. There is a danger of becoming too reliant on this funding though, and should it be taken away then the country could suffer greatly.
