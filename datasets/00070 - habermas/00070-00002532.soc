# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No i don't believe it is - we have a lot more rules in the UK compared to the US, although having never been to the US, this is just my opinion.  The US I believe have a lot more freedom of rights.  in the UK we have things such as CCTV camera's to police the nation, this i believe is not present in the US, this would have a direct impact on what people do & don't do.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes I believe the UK is more multicultural, better educated and has greater exposure to cultures outside its own. As such I believe there is more acceptance by people for cultures that is different to their own.The US tends to have more of a mono culture and there is more pressure to conform to American ideals rather than outside cultures positively influencing the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes I think in this country we need to be cracking down more on criminal to many times criminals get away with just a slap on the wrists for there crimes this would not happen un the US and they are not as soft on immigration
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I think that generally the UK is a more tolerant country that the USA. The main reason for this is that in the UK religion tends to encroach far less on the way the country is run and the views of the people. There appears to be far less separation of Church and State in the US which enables extreme conservative viewpoints to dominate. These tend to be intolerant in nature and work in direct opposition to how I feel a sane and just society should operate. An example is the damage done to reproductive rights.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Yes i believe that as a nation, the UK is more tolerant than the US but also perhaps one of the most tolerant countries there is. This is no slight against the US but the UK is an extremely multicultural society where we have seen vast amounts of immigration over the past 60 years. We have vast communities spread across the nation that hold different values and beliefs, that speak different languages and that follow different religions yet all are treated equally and respected. We have politicians and leaders from different ethic backgrounds and celebrate different cultural holidays together as a nation.
