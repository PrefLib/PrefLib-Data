# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I support increasing tax on higher incomes in general. But 80% seems too high. It will leave no motivation for working for higher incomes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - 80% is far too excessive. When you consider people in those homes will pay 50% super tax on incomes, plus massive inheritance tax on the estate when someone dies, and now you want an 80% tax. Surely there's better ways to save money than just the standard default of "tax rich stuff". 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We need to reform tax law in the UK to make it fairer for all. The Ultra rich can afford to pay extra tax. This money can be used for essential services. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No as the rate is far to high and would discourage wealthy people from visiting investing or spending here. It would make more sense to tax less to encourage the wealthy to come here and spend and invest here.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - While I agree that people who earn substantial amounts of money like this, I do not think it is fair to tax 80% of that income. Where would that tax money go? Would it be used to reduce poverty, if so then maybe a lower percentage would be fairer but they have earnt that money and clearly worked hard so why should such a high percentage be taxed. It is because of extreme tax rates like this that rich people then feel they have to try and attempt tax evasion by hiding money overseas.
