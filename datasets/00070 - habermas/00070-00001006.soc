# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should fund charities, in a limited capacity, to ensure that vulnerable people in our society are being catered for. Charities have a mixed record in successfully deploying money. Some charities are good - some wasteful - some incompetent. Therefore, the government should track the activities of charities and get reports to know how to better serve the people they represent and ensure that everyone is impacted by the administration. A guideline should be put in place to ensure that the charities are performing efficiently, but the UK has some obligation to fund charities -- especially ones that are most needed in the UK. Such as food shelters.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK has a responsibility to fund charities which can perform some activities that the government may not necessary be fully covering. For example charities can reach remote locals and find out about the vulnerability of the that community. They are often the first to reach a crisis situation like when a disaster occurs. They often offer free services to people in need without the numerous government buracaracy. However, the government should also be able to track the activities of the charities to ensure they are delivering what is expected and are meeting the needs of the people that the charities represent.

We shouldn't overspend but have a guideline of how much of the budget should be put forth to these. The vulnerable point is great. The part where they say how the Government can track the charities and get to know the people of this country and the needs is an excellent point I wouldn't have thought of that. Although I doubt the government would be willing to do that -- I don't have much faith in them doing anything competently. I agree with this fully.
