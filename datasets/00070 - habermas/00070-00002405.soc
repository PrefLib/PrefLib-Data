# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should not be allowed into nightclubs. There are a number of reasons for this, including the fact that nightclubs often serve alcohol, which is not appropriate for children. They also often contain sexualised imagery, which is also not appropriate for children. There are also a number of safety concerns, including the fact that nightclubs are often in poorly lit areas, and the fact that many nightclubs contain drugs and drug users. There is also the issue that nightclubs can contain adult content, which is not appropriate for children. Therefore, nightclubs should be restricted to adults only.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Children should not be allowed into nightclubs. Nightclubs are adult environments, where alcohol is served, and can be subject to adult activities such as drug use and sexual activity, which children should not be exposed to. Thus they are not appropriate places for children. The participants in this group each had very similar views on the question. This made the consensus process very easy, with the first draft consensus statement being very close to the final consensus statement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should be restricted from entering nightclubs because they are places where alcohol is sold and where adult behaviour occurs. Children should not be exposed to alcohol or adult behaviour. The nightclub environment is not appropriate for children. The nightclub scene is sexualised, and children should not be exposed to this. Children should not be exposed to drunk adults. Children should not be exposed to drug taking. Children should not be exposed to the dangers of the night.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children should not be allowed into nightclubs. Nightclubs are adult environments, where alcohol is served, and can be subject to adult activities such as drug use and sexual activity, which children should not be exposed to. Thus they are not appropriate places for children.
