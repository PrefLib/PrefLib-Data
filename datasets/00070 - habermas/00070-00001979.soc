# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government is doing a lot to protect our privacy, but there is still more to be done. The government should look into the issue of privacy on the internet and the impact of the use of personal information on social media. They should also look into how to protect personal information from scammers and how to deal with the issue of personal information being leaked from the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government is not doing enough to protect our privacy. They seem to have the wrong approach and what they are suggesting seems to be completely wrong and doesn't make sense. It is so easily accessible and it seems to be a huge problem.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government are not doing enough to protect our privacy. It's very difficult to find out what they are actually doing to protect our privacy, so it's hard to give them a full endorsement. The amount of leaks that have occurred from the government is worrying and doesn't fill you with much confidence. Furthermore, it is also very hard to see how the government are protecting our privacy when so much of our information is leaked every day, even from the most well-protected companies in the world. The government should do more to try and tackle the problem of leaked data, as the risk of losing information such as bank details, address, and phone number is becoming increasingly likely. The government should also do more to make sure that the people who are leaking our data are punished in some way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government is not doing enough to protect our privacy. They have made some good attempts at protecting our privacy, however, the scale of the problem is so great that it is very hard to control. The government needs to do more to ensure that the private information of citizens is protected. This is especially important with the advent of new technology such as smart devices and the internet of things, where everything is connected to the internet and thus can be accessed by hackers. The government needs to be more proactive in protecting the privacy of citizens.
