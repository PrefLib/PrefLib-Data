# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of using AI in the judicial system. The group felt that it is important to have human consideration in the judicial system, and AI would not be able to do this. The group felt that AI would be too strict and would not be able to take into account the circumstances of each case. The group also felt that AI would not be able to take into account human emotion, and this is an important part of the judicial system. The group felt that AI would be more likely to make mistakes, and this could ruin people's lives. The group also felt that AI could develop biases, and this would not be fair. The group felt that AI could be used to speed up processes for lower level crimes, but it should not be the only deciding factor.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the use of AI in the judicial system, but with caveats.  The use of AI should be limited to speeding up processes and making the system more efficient.  It should not be used to make decisions on the guilt or innocence of a person, and it should not be used to decide on the sentence of a person.  It should not be used to make a decision on the release of a person from prison.  It should not be used to make a decision on the parole of a person.  It should not be used to make a decision on the deportation of a person.  It should not be used to make a decision on the extradition of a person.  It should not be used to make a decision on the granting of a visa.  It should not be used to make a decision on the granting of refugee status.  It should not be used to make a decision on the granting of citizenship.  It should not be used to make a decision on the granting of bail.  It should not be used to make a decision on the granting of parole.  It should not be used to make a decision on the granting of a visa.  It should not
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that it is not ethical to use AI in the judicial system. The main reason for this is that AI is essentially based on an algorithm, which is a set of rules. While humans may be biased or have different opinions, the rules of law are not so variable. In this sense, we feel that AI is not able to grasp the different human situations and behaviour, which may affect the fairness of the judicial system. For example, the legal system of the UK has been developed for many centuries to take into account different circumstances, such as how old a person was at the time of the crime, or how much a person understood the consequences of their actions. This would be too complex for AI to be able to grasp, and so AI would not be able to provide the fairest outcome for a case.
