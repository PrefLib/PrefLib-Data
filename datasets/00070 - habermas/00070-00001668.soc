# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - While the legalisation of all drugs is not supported by the group, some members were open to the idea of decriminalisation, where drugs are not criminalised but their possession, sale and use are still offences. Although the group generally agreed that it is wrong to use recreational drugs, the general view was that cannabis is the least harmful and most widely used recreational drug. This was considered the exception to the rule and the consensus was that the possession of cannabis for personal use should not be criminalised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final consensus statement: It is the opinion of the majority of the group that it is wrong to use recreational drugs. However, some members of the group think it would be a good idea to decriminalise cannabis, because it is the least harmful of all the recreational drugs, and because its decriminalisation would help to reduce poverty and criminality by bringing recreational drug dealing and use into the legal sphere, where it can be monitored, and where the needs of addicts can be provided for properly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While the legalisation of all drugs is not supported by the group, some members were open to the idea of decriminalisation, where drugs are not criminalised but their possession, sale and use are still offences. Although the group generally agreed that it is wrong to use recreational drugs, the general view was that cannabis is the least harmful and most widely used recreational drug. This was considered the exception to the rule and the consensus was that the possession of cannabis for personal use should not be criminalised. The group felt that it was also important to note that there is a strong link between poverty and the use of recreational drugs, and that the drug laws need to be looked at as a whole. The group felt that this link between poverty and the use of recreational drugs must be considered in the debate, and was another factor that showed that the war on drugs had failed.
