# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the fast food industry is very powerful and has a lot of influence on people. In particular, it has a lot of influence on children and teenagers, who are often the target of fast food advertising. However, we also feel that banning fast food outlets near schools will not be a productive measure to reduce the consumption of fast food. The ban would be unfair to businesses, and would likely have little effect. Instead, we feel that the government should make more of an effort to educate people about the dangers of eating fast food, and also make more of an effort to promote healthy eating, in general. We feel that this would be a much more productive approach to this problem.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should not ban fast food chains from operating near schools. We should encourage people to eat more healthily, but we should not limit the choices of the people. Banning fast food chains near schools would be ineffective as it would lead to fast food chains opening up further away from schools, and it would also be unfair to the businesses and to the people who work there. We should also not place too much responsibility on businesses, as it is the responsibility of parents to ensure that their children eat healthily and that they make the right choices. However, it was agreed that fast food chains should not be allowed to advertise their products in schools, and that there should be more education in schools on the benefits of healthy eating and the risks of eating fast food.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Fast food chains should not be banned from operating near schools. The issue is more complicated than that. There are many factors that influence children's health, and fast food is only one of them. Fast food chains provide jobs for many people, and banning them from operating near schools would be unfair to them. Children are influenced by many things, and banning fast food near schools would not be a very effective way of tackling childhood obesity. It would be better to educate children on why fast food is unhealthy, and provide cheap, healthy school meals. This way, we would be less likely to take away the livelihoods of many people, while still encouraging a healthy lifestyle.
