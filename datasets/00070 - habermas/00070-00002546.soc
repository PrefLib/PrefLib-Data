# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - they are not good as we already have a over populated country and there is no space to house these immigrants.  they usually also are unskilled and are a drain on society and usually claim benefits as soon as they come here and don't contribute to society
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes the high level of immigration is good for the UK. The high level of immigration creates a bigger pool of talent and workforce that will be crucial for economic drive of the UK in the next decade. With this pool of talents the best gets to show their value which is good for the society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I believe it is important to employ skills from different backgrounds and different countries as it benefits the whole population in general, increasing the volume of highly skilled individuals. It also allows for better national services as these said individuals would bring more money to the nation. The UK is such a diverse population and it should be treated as a melting pot. I also believe it is important to provide equal opportunity for all individuals from any backgrounds and it should be a moral duty to provide safe havens for individuals fleeing from dangerous situations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think it depends on the context but just from a numbers point of view, probably not!. culturally i have zero issue with people coming here, especially people looking for work. Asylum is a different thing but immigration, i say bring them in. A great deal of the foreign people ive communicated with at work who are from other lands have been fantastic, most native people.......well, lets say not so much.  so if its purely numbers, i guess not due to crowding, but if you just mean  high amounts of foreign people then yes, fine, water down the native population
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - The issue with immigration is that of illegal immigration.  There are people entering the country who will not be working but will need their daily living needs to be paid for and this is crippling the country for people who are mid to low earners.  Resources are in short supply such as our NHS system which is already struggling.  The rich do not care about the demands on the NHS because they are rich enough to go private, but if this has to be privatised, then it will become like the USA where you have to pay 10,000 dollars to call out an ambulance and pay much more to have a baby.  Finally, there is not enough of cheaper housing available for people to buy and we cannot house all the illegal immigrants.  However, non-illegal immigration can bring benefits to the country in terms of innovation.  On balance illegal immigration is not good for the country and it is only going to get worse, whereas non-illegal immigrants can benefit our country's industry.
