# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the government should make it easier for people to switch energy suppliers. We believe that this will give people more freedom to choose the supplier that is right for them, whether it be for financial or environmental reasons. The current system is very confusing and difficult for people to navigate. We believe that if the government made the process of switching energy suppliers as simple as it is to switch bank accounts, it would make the energy market fairer for the consumer. It would also hold energy suppliers to account and make them more competitive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the government should make it easier for people to switch energy suppliers. There are many reasons for this. Firstly, the current system is unfair to the consumer. The energy companies are making huge profits, yet the consumer is struggling to afford to heat their homes. The only way to ensure that prices stay competitively low for consumers is to make switching between energy providers very simple and easy to do, so that consumers that are unhappy with the prices they are paying can vote with their feet. Secondly, the government should be encouraging people to save both money and environmental impact so regardless of the reason that customers want to switch, the government should do everything in their power to make the process simple.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “The government should make it easier for people to switch energy suppliers. It is the only way to ensure that energy companies do not take their customers for granted and keep prices low. The process should be as simple as the current account switch programme, which is a proven success. This will also encourage people to be more environmentally friendly in their energy choices, as it will be easier to switch to renewable energy suppliers. It is also a matter of fairness, as the government has already made it easier to switch broadband and mobile phone providers, and energy is just as important to people.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should make it easier for people to switch energy suppliers. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, it would allow people to be more proactive in their energy use, allowing them to choose suppliers based on a number of factors such as price, environmental impact and customer service. Secondly, it would allow people to be more environmentally friendly in their energy use, by allowing them to choose suppliers that provide more green energy. Thirdly, it would allow people to save money on their energy bills, by allowing them to choose suppliers that provide the best value for money. Finally, it would allow people to hold energy suppliers to account, by allowing them to switch suppliers if they are unhappy with the service they are receiving.
