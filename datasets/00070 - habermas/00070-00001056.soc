# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is a good idea to reduce the working week to 3 days provided productivity can be maintained and wages can be maintained. We feel that this would benefit the population as a whole, as the working population will have a better work life balance, which would in turn improve the physical and mental health of the population. However, we feel that the effects of a reduction in working hours on the economy and international trade would have to be considered.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the conclusion that a 3 day working week would be beneficial to the health of the nation, but we are unsure if this would be feasible for the country as a whole. The working week would have to be changed in all sectors of work and not just in some, otherwise this would cause problems in the work place. We think that if the working week was reduced, the amount of money that people earned would also have to be reduced, as we would not be working as many hours. This could be a problem for some people, as they may not be able to afford to live. We think that the working week should be reduced for some jobs, but not all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is not a good idea to reduce the working week to 3 days as the long term benefits would not outweigh the short term negative impacts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, it is not a good idea to reduce the working week to 3 days. This is because we are a fairly unproductive country as it is and this will only serve to make the population of the country poorer overall. Less work means less production and therefore less trade with the rest of the world which in the end makes us a poorer country overall.
