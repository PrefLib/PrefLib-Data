# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Fracking is a slang term for hydraulic fracturing which is the process of creating fractures in rocks and rock formations by injecting specialised fluid into cracks to force them open even further. The fracking process is a controversial topic in the UK as it can have both positive and negative effects. The UK is heavily reliant on fossil fuels and so fracking could be a way to reduce the dependency on other countries for energy resources. The process could also create jobs for local people. However, the process has been banned in Scotland due to the environmental implications it has on the surrounding areas. The process has been known to cause earthquakes and can also cause noise disturbances for local people. In conclusion, the group has come to the consensus opinion that fracking should not be allowed in Scotland.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Fracking is a slang term for hydraulic fracturing which is the process of creating fractures in rocks and rock formations by injecting specialised fluid into cracks to force them open even further. The Scottish government have banned fracking in Scotland due to the implications it has on the environment. There has been a significant change in public perceptions of the environment, the climate crisis and the expectations of government to respond which means that as a result fracking was banned in Scotland. I see no need to reverse this ban.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Fracking should not be allowed in Scotland. Fracking is a process that has been used in the United States for many years, but it is only in recent years that it has been used in the UK. The process of fracking has many negative implications for the environment, including; the risk of earthquakes, water contamination, noise pollution and air pollution. The process also has implications for the local people living in the areas where fracking takes place. The process reduces the value of their houses, and causes noise disturbances. The process of fracking also has implications for climate change. The process of fracking uses a large amount of energy and therefore produces a large amount of greenhouse gases. Countries should be investing in renewable energy, and reducing the effects of climate change as it enters into critical levels.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, fracking is not a good idea. The extraction of oil and gas through fracking is not a good idea for Scotland and the rest of the UK as it has a detrimental impact on the environment. The process of fracking is extremely damaging to the environment and causes significant harm to the local communities where it is taking place. Fracking can also cause earthquakes and therefore has the potential to cause damage to property. There is also the issue of climate change and the effect that fracking has on this. The extraction of gas and oil through fracking can also cause methane to be released into the atmosphere which is a harmful greenhouse gas.
