# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “The positive recreational-medical benefits of legalising recreational cannabis use far outweigh the negative risks and are highly recommend. We should be working towards legalisation with heavy taxes to regulate and to fund education and public works.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should legalise recreational cannabis use, as it can help people with a lot of medical conditions. The people currently growing and selling it illegally could make money out of growing it legally and selling it in government licensed shops. It should be taxed, so we can use that money to fund public services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, legalising marijuana is the way forward. By taxing it we can put money back into the economy. This would be used to improve our schools and public works, which in turn would mean we have better skilled workers for the future. The crime rate would be reduced, and this would mean we have less money to spend on the police. It would also be more regulated so people will have a better idea of what they're smoking. The only concern would be with it's recreational use, and that is where the dangers can be found. If people are aware of what they're smoking, and what it can do to them, then we will be able to better regulate this drug and prevent the effects of it being so detrimental.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that cannabis should be legalised for recreational use, and heavily taxed. This will reduce crime, and also provide funding for schools and other public services.
