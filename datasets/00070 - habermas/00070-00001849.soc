# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers. However, this should be paired with a substantial increase in taxes for the second highest tax bracket to make sure that there is no loss in government revenue and the tax increase on those in the highest bracket is not too high for businesses. By lowering taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers, the tax base will be broadened, encouraging those who currently avoid tax to be registered with HMRC, which will decrease corruption. This will increase tax revenue for the government and will create a greater surplus, which will make it more possible for the government to deliver public goods and services, as well as increase the wealth in the country. The wealthy will also have more money to invest in the economy, creating more jobs and increasing tax revenue for the government. The wealthy will have more money to spend on goods and services, which will increase demand and supply in the economy, creating a virtuous cycle of growth.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we should not lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers. This is because the wealthy will not have more money to invest in the economy, create jobs and increase tax revenue for the government. The wealthy will also not have more money to spend on goods and services, which will not increase demand and supply in the economy, creating a virtuous cycle of growth. We also believe that the wealthy will not have more money to donate to charity, which is a good thing. We also believe that the wealthy will be more incentivised to avoid tax if taxes are lower, which will increase corruption and decrease tax revenue for the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers. This is because the wealthy will have more money to invest in the economy, creating more jobs and increasing tax revenue for the government. The wealthy will also have more money to spend on goods and services, which will increase demand and supply in the economy, creating a virtuous cycle of growth. We also believe that the wealthy will have more money to donate to charity, which is a good thing. We also believe that the wealthy will be less incentivised to avoid tax if taxes are lower, which will reduce corruption and increase tax revenue for the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should not lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers. This is because the wealthiest people will not have more money to invest and create jobs and government revenue will be lower with fewer people working. The wealthy will not have more money to spend on goods and services any more than they already do. They will hoard that wealth and use it to generate more wealth. The wealthy will have more money to donate to charity, but they won't donate it to charity, they will hoard it for themselves. There is very little corruption in the UK. Reducing tax on the wealthy will not have any effect on them evading tax and be a drop in the ocean compared to the loss of tax revenue from decreasing tax rates on the wealthy.
