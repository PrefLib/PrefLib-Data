# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I don't think cars should be equipped with speed limiters as at times, drivers need to go above the speed limit to overtake or to move out of a hazard's way. I don't like being limited on how I can use the car which I paid for. I may want to drive into Europe and drive on roads without a speed limit or take my car to a racing track - so I should have the freedom to drive without a limit when I want to. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I dont think that they should but i do think that people should obey the law and make sure that they do what they should. People should be responsible
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - They should in general, as long as the rule is being followed across all drivers in the country. This will be a good idea but it might have some flaws 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - All new cars should have speed limiters fitted. Many new cars already have them fitted and they are useful. It needs to be able to be selected by the driver and have variable settings. It should be able to be switched on and off by the driver.   
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I think from a safety point of view they should but there is also a lot of safe drivers so it may also be good for it to be a choice for car owners. I think they would be a popular choice amongst car owners.
