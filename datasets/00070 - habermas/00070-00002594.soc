# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: i'm neutral about this as i don't know how safe this is; personally i'll be too scared to enter a driverless car because of the series of what ifs that will be going through my head
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I think that the introduction of driverless cars will result in a decrease in the number of road accidents. I believe that most accidents are caused because people drive carelessly and they do not adhere to the rules around driving e.g. sticking to the speed limit. I also think that accidents are caused by human error, for instance when people are tired or distracted. If driverless cars are introduced then the margin for human error will be removed and the number of accidents should be reduced.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I feel there will be an increase. Where I live in the past few days, a driver was unable to take control of his new electric car and had to be rammed off the road by police. I also do not trust our governments to put in the proper infrastructure for these autonomous vehicles. I would much rather be in control of the car than a computer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I feel that that the initial introduction of driverless cars to the roads would at first result in an incraese in the number of road accidents. This mainly being due to the fact that anything new tends to come with consiquences. Plus any new form of technology generally is never without flaws. These eventually get ironed out. This being said i think that after an initial spike in road accidents while drivers get used to the new technology, it would eventually fall. How long this would take is not within my knowledge. In conjunction with this, if it was to ever get to a point where the large majority of cars on the road were driverless we may actually see a decrease in the number of road accidents.
