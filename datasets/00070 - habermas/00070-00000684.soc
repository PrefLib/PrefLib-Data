# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “We believe that immigration is a good thing for the UK as it leads to economic growth and cultural growth. We believe that there should be rules on who is let in, but we should try and take a positive approach to the issue. We also need to do our duty as a stable country and try to provide a safe haven for those less fortunate and provide a place that can give immigrants a chance to improve their lives.“
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Immigration is essential to the uk and should be allowed in a regulated manner. We have an obligation to other human beings to be a safe place when needed. There should be a set of criteria of who are allowed to come to UK. There should of course be rules on who is let in but we should try and take a positive approach to the issue.
