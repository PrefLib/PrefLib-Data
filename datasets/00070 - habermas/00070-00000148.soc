However, this must be done gradually so the BBC has time to make the necessary adjustments. The BBC should be more cost-efficient and focus more on quality rather than quantity.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The BBC should have a smaller budget, however not in a drastic way. The BBC should keep a small budget to allow the BBC to keep going and create more cost-efficient programs. Therefore, the BBC will not be putting on as much programming as before.”
