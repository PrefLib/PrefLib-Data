# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the costs of globalization are outweighed by its benefits due to the improvements in technology in transportation and communication and the sheer volume of the trade between countries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There are many different factors which need to be taken into account when trying to decide whether the costs of globalization are outweighed by its benefits. This is a very difficult thing to do, as the market is so vast and so many different factors are involved. However, when you take into account the improvements in transportation and communication which have made this globalization possible, and you look at the volume of trade which is done between countries, and you consider the benefits to the consumer, it is difficult to imagine that it is not outweighed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The benefits of globalization are obviously very noticeable, and have affected every person's life in one way or another. However, the true cost is difficult to measure, as so many different factors are involved in creating the global market we see today. It is important to recognize that factors such as transportation and communication have played a huge role in allowing the global market to be created, but they are also the factors that have created negative consequences such as increased pollution from goods transportation. Although globalization can provide consumers with a wider range of products than they would be able to find in their domestic markets, the cost of these products is often such that it is less than they would have been in their own domestic market.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There are many different factors involved in globalization, and it is difficult to say for certain whether the costs are outweighed by the benefits. However, we feel that the benefits to consumers are great enough that they do outweigh the costs of globalization.
