# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the wealthiest people in society do not necessarily deserve lower taxes as they are in the position to afford to pay their fair share of tax. The taxes that they pay have to be accounted for and used wisely to help the poorest in society. However, there is always the concern that people may stop working if their tax rate is too high and this would be bad for the country as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, we should not lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers as this would mean the government would lose a significant amount of revenue that could be used to help the poorest people in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that we should not lower taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers. We feel that they can afford to pay more and that this is an important source of income for the country. The wealthiest taxpayers are in the position they are in because they have worked hard to get there and should not be punished for this. If we were to lower the taxes then the money would have to be found from somewhere else and this would impact on other people who are not in the same financial position.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe the government should be putting more focus on other factors which can help improve our economy. We should be aiming to improve productivity and output from our workforce in the UK and we should be focusing on making sure businesses can expand and grow. This will ensure that our economy grows, and that there is enough money to go around to keep everyone happy.
