# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of legalising cannabis for recreational use.  The main argument for this was that cannabis is already widely used and is a relatively safe drug compared to many others.  The group felt that legalising cannabis would allow the government to regulate the market, and therefore protect the public from dangerous products.  The group felt that cannabis should be treated in a similar way to alcohol and tobacco, with a ban on advertising and a minimum age for purchase.  The group felt that driving under the influence of cannabis should be treated in the same way as driving under the influence of alcohol.  The group felt that cannabis should be legalised for medicinal use, with the proviso that it should be used as a last resort, when other treatments have failed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It was agreed that the legalization of cannabis would be an effective measure in reducing crime and violence on our streets. It would allow us to enforce a tighter control over the quality of drugs, their strength, and the age limits to whom they are accessible. The legalization of cannabis would also bring the control of its usage out into the open and hopefully decrease the stigma around the use of it. It would also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of criminals taking control of the cannabis trade, which is proven to lead to more dangerous drugs.
