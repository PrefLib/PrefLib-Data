# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is an element of a re-skilling crisis. However, it is not necessarily a crisis. The world of work is changing and it is important that we prepare people for the changing world of work. It is also important that we support people in transitioning to new jobs and new careers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is highly likely that we are in the midst of a 're-skilling' crisis. New technologies are taking over jobs that humans used to do. Many of the skills that were once required are no longer required. Many people are leaving work that they once enjoyed and moving to a new sector, often after re-training and gaining new skills. This does not necessarily have to be a bad thing, as people can use new skills and experiences to enjoy new jobs. But it is vital that the necessary support is provided to enable people to transition into new roles and for young people to be prepared for this eventuality.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is hard to say whether we are in the midst of a 're-skilling' crisis. While there are more skills and technologies than ever before and some jobs and skills are in decline, it is possible that others will emerge or be discovered. There are still jobs that require no skills at all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is a re-skilling crisis in the sense that the skills needed for jobs are changing all the time and people need to keep upskilling. This is especially true for those in manual or low-skilled jobs who are at risk of being replaced by technology. The crisis is also exacerbated by the low level of basic skills, especially literacy and numeracy, amongst school leavers, and the lack of emphasis on soft skills such as communication, teamwork and problem solving. The crisis is also evident in the high level of unemployment amongst young people, many of whom are underemployed. However, the crisis is also an opportunity for many people to learn new skills and to move into new jobs that are more satisfying and better paid. There is a strong argument for governments to provide more funding for adult education and training to enable this to happen. The second question that the participants were asked to deliberate on was: What are the implications of this crisis for policy makers? Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
