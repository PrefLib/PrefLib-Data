# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, especially on tight sidewalks. Bikes are quiet, and more dangeous to pedestrians than we tend to think. In more open spaces, I believe it's more safe for bikes and pedestrians to mix. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No they shouldn't as it is extremely dangerous for pedestrians walking on the pavement. (sidewalk) It could also be dangerous for the cyclists as they are moving vehicles won't be able to see them as easily as if they were on the road.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - If I was asked to answer specifically yes or no,I would say no.  Pedestrians are put at risk by fast moving or unsteady bike riders and can't always move out of the way quick enough or hear the cyclist approaching.   Some sidewalks are narrow or otherwise unsuitable for bikes.  However, there are often times that it is much safer for a cyclist to be on a sidewalk, usually for the cyclists benefit but sometimes for other road users' benefit.  For example in fast heavy traffic on a narrow road it would be safer for everyone for the slower cyclist to be on the sidewalk out of the way.  However in that situation the cyclist should monitor their speed and give way to pedestrians.  They should also be extra vigilant and use their bell when approaching people on foot or blind spots.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Unless provision has been made (such as a designated pedestrian and designated cycle lane), then bikes should not be ridden on the sidewalk. However this can be contentious in countries where cycling infrastructure is poor. For example in countries such as The Netherlands or Denmark, where there is significant cycling infrastructure, there should be no reason for bikes to be ridden on the sidewalk. However in countries such as the UK which has poor or limited cycling infrastructure, the safest alternative can sometimes be to cycle with due care and attention on the sidewalk. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - in general i don't think people should be able to ride bikes on sidewalks and it is dangerous to pedestrians, however in certain circumstances (eg, the road is dangerous, the rider is a small kid) it is safer for bikes to ride on sidewalks than on the road
