# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of people earning less than the minimum wage having to pay income tax.  The group felt that this would be unfair as it would mean that people would be taxed on money that they do not have.  However, the group felt that the minimum wage should be increased to a level that is more in line with the cost of living.  The group felt that if the minimum wage was increased to a level that is more in line with the cost of living then it would be fair for people to pay income tax on their earnings.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, as the minimum wage is barely enough to live on, it would not be fair to impose a tax on those earning it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, everyone should pay an income tax, even if earning less than the minimum wage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is unfair to expect people on the minimum wage to pay an income tax. However, it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that people have an income sufficient to live on. We should focus on ensuring that the minimum wage is a living wage. If the minimum wage was sufficient, then the group would feel that it is fair for people on the minimum wage to pay an income tax.
