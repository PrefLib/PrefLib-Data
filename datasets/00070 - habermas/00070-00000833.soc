# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, the sale of fireworks should be restricted to licensed vendors. Fireworks can be dangerous and we believe that restricting their sale to licensed vendors would reduce the likelihood of them being sold to irresponsible people. We believe that licensed vendors would be more likely to sell fireworks to responsible people who would use them in a safe manner.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, fireworks are dangerous and should be well regulated. There should be stricter usage requirements and limits linked to when they can be sold. The retail sale of fireworks should be restricted to licensed vendors and those putting on authorised displays. It's ridiculous that anyone can essentially buy explosives over the counter. They are highly dangerous and they're far from essential at the average celebration. The retail sale of fireworks should be restricted to licensed vendors. This will go some way to ensuring that fireworks are not sold to those who are irresponsible and should reduce any firework related accidents.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Yes, we should restrict the sale of fireworks to licensed vendors. Fireworks can be dangerous and the sale of fireworks should be restricted to licensed vendors. This will go some way to ensuring that fireworks are not sold to those who are irresponsible and should reduce any firework related accidents. This would make it safer for everyone.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should restrict the sale of fireworks to licensed vendors. Fireworks are dangerous and should be well regulated. You should be licensed to sell or store them because they are explosives and we need to ensure they are manufactured to high safety standards and then transported and stored safely and only sold responsibly to limit and prevent accidents and harm. We also believe there should be stricter usage requirements and limits linked to when they can be sold because of the negative effects they can have on animals and wildlife. We would also like to see a move to limiting the noise or better yet reducing the noise completely if that is possible.
