# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the current representation of women in parliament is not reflective of the diversity in our society. Therefore, we believe that increasing the proportion of women in parliament is a necessary step in the right direction. However, we also believe that this should be implemented with keeping in mind strict rigour. Those women have to be competent, trustworthy and hard-working. Gender alone should never be a sufficient criterion for choosing an MP. We believe that increasing the proportion of women in parliament will result in a more representative and diverse parliament, which will in turn result in a more representative and diverse government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the proportion of women in parliament should be increased. However, this action should be implemented with keeping in mind strict rigour. Those women have to be competent, trustworthy and hard-working. Gender alone should never be a sufficient criterion for choosing an MP.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that we should increase the proportion of women in parliament. This is because parliament should be a microcosm of society. To ensure this, MPs should be elected on merit, competence and by personal integrity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, we should increase the proportion of women in parliament. This is because MPs represent the people and as such should reflect the diversity in our population. However, we don't believe a lot of the men in parliament represent society, and we should increase by competence, not gender. Someone should be hired by merit and competence in the role. Those women have to be competent, trustworthy and hard-working. Gender alone should never be a sufficient criterion for choosing an MP.
