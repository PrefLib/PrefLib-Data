# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The BBC is a national treasure that benefits the UK. It is right that the elderly receive a free TV license once they reach the age of 75, as this provides them with some means of entertainment in their old age without the need for them to pay at a stage in life where money may be a real problem. The majority of the over 75s will have been paying their TV licence for the whole of their adult life. The money received from the TV licence is spent on maintaining the BBC as a high quality broadcaster and has helped it to remain the best TV provider in the world. This money is not spent on the over 75s in particular. Older people may not be able to pay for entertainment such as this and, as the elderly may have to live on small amounts of money, a free TV licence will help. The elderly are more likely to be living alone and may be very bored.  Older people may be feeling more isolated due to Covid. I also feel that the BBC provides a lifeline to the elderly through the likes of Dr.Kirsty and Jeremy Vine.  It’s a way of staying in touch with current affairs and helps prevent loneliness.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that the BBC should provide free licenses to over 75s. We believe that the BBC is a national institution which provides entertainment to the UK population. We think that it is right that the elderly receive a free TV license once they reach the age of 75, as this provides them with some means of entertainment in their old age without the need for them to pay at a stage in life where money may be a real problem. The likelihood is that the majority of the over 75s will have been paying their TV licence for the whole of their adult life. We also believe that the elderly are often isolated and lonely and this provides them with some entertainment and relief from this. We also believe that the elderly often live on small amounts of money and so this is a small way in which they can be helped.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the decision that the BBC should provide free licenses to over 75s. We believe that the elderly have paid their dues and deserve a free license.
