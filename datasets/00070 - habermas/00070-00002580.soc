# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The price of electric cars is currently far too high for the average car buyer to purchase. You will be making poor people even poorer by removing the choice and banning the cars. Modern exhaust systems and additives can reduce emissions further if goverments supported them. Diesel and petrols cars should not be banned.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Long term - most definitely, cars powered by fossil fuels like this are bad for the environment. Short term - no. We, at least in the UK, do not have the infrastructure in place to switch to all electric cars as there are not enough charge points nationwide and the cars also do not have very good range at the moment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think in a sense we should, perhaps not immediately as this could cause major issues but some time in the near future we will have to as there will not be enough petrol to maintain those cars. whether people like it or not electric cars will have to be the future and they should be implemented much more over the years.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I do not believe we should completely stop selling petrol & diesel cars. We can gradually becoming more electric/automatic but would be easier to reduce the use of petrol/diesel cars gradually considering a large percentage of people still use them. Plus for a lot of people, they are not able to afford expensive electric cars therefore need to rely on cheaper diesel/petrol vehicles to get around. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: No, I do not believe that we should stop selling diesel and petrol cars at the moment as there is no viable and tested alternative available right now.  I do not believe that the long-term efficiency and ability to cope with a huge influx of electric cars is proven at the moment.
