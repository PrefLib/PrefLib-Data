# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The quality of a child's education should not be decided by where they live, or their background. A system should be in place to make sure that each school is fair to all pupils and is a safe and enjoyable place to be. This system should also allow parents the freedom to choose which school is best for their child, as long as this does not conflict with the child's safety or wellbeing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Parents should have the right to choose their children’s school, however a balanced system should be in place so that each school has a fair amount of students. This could be achieved by having a set of “tie-breakers” in place which gives preference to certain groups (e.g. siblings, disadvantaged families, disadvantaged areas). Parents should also have the right to withdraw their child from a school if the situation warrants it. This should be closely monitored and there should be a process in place for the child to return to school at a later stage.” Conclusion There is a common misconception that it is very difficult to get a group of people with differing opinions to come to a consensus. Although there are many things that can be done to facilitate consensus, there is a need for all parties to be willing to compromise and make concessions. With this in mind, the consensus statement reached by this group of participants was an excellent example of what is possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “In principle, parents should have the right to choose their children’s schools. The child’s best interests must be put first in any decision. This should be managed fairly, with no disadvantage to any groups of children.  In particular, disadvantaged families should have a right to choose the school that they want their child to attend. Children should also have a say in their education and their opinion should be taken into account.  If the child’s opinion is in line with the parents’ and the school’s, the choice should be honoured. If not, the parent and the school should investigate the situation to find out why the child does not want to go to that school. If it is found that the child has a valid reason for not wanting to go to that school, for example they feel unsafe or bullied, then the parent and the school should work together to find a solution. This could include withdrawing the child from the school for a period of time, and then returning to the school at a later stage.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Parents should have the right to choose their children’s school, however a balanced system should be in place so that each school has a fair amount of students. Parents should be allowed to withdraw their children from a school if the situation warrants it. This should be closely monitored and there should be a process in place for the child to return to school at a later stage.
