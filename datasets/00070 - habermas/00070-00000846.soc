# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “The NHS is a good model for providing healthcare. It is a fair and equal model that provides care for the public, so in that regard, it is a good model as healthcare should indeed be fair and equal, and not restricted by wealth like in some other countries. However, it costs the government a lot to maintain this model and there are some areas of free healthcare that are more questionable than others. Recently there has been a call for more prescriptions and treatments to no longer be provided for free to save the NHS money, and I agree with that. This ensures that our model remains efficient and effective. The NHS is a good model for providing healthcare.

I actually believe the opposite, prescriptions are free in Wales and Scotland, it is only in England where we pay for them and this should not be the case. The funding for the NHS should be increased so that everyone can have free access to prescription medicines. The government does not need to raise more money for the NHS, the money is already there, they are just choosing to spend it on other things.”

This ensures that our model remains efficient and effective. For example, some people believe that treatments for smoking related illnesses should not be provided for free by the NHS, as this encourages smoking. Another example is that some people believe that cosmetic surgery should not be provided for free by the NHS, as this is not essential for survival. However, there are some treatments that are essential for survival, and these should be provided for free by the NHS, such as chemotherapy and dialysis.
