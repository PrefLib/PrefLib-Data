# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have a public holiday in the UK that commemorates the end of the Second World War. This is something that impacted many people in the UK and all over the world. However, there is no public holiday for the end of the First World War, which again had a large impact on people. It is time to have a public holiday that commemorates the many groups in the UK that have been marginalised throughout history.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of having a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. The main argument was that it would be too difficult to decide which groups to include, and that it would be too many holidays. It was also argued that it would be difficult to decide on the date of such a holiday, as it would be very likely to clash with an existing holiday. It was also argued that it would be difficult to decide on the name of such a holiday, as it would be very likely to offend people. However, the group did agree that it would be a good idea to have a public holiday to celebrate the contributions of historically marginalised groups, but that this should be an additional day to an existing holiday, such as the summer or winter solstice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of having a public holiday to celebrate the contributions of historically marginalised groups. It was felt that it would be a good way to educate the public and celebrate the diversity of the UK. It was also felt that it would be a good way to increase unity in the country and show that the country is willing to learn from its past mistakes. However, it was also felt that it would be difficult to decide which groups to celebrate, and that it would be unfair to celebrate some and not others. It was also felt that it would be difficult to decide which day to celebrate, and that it would be unfair to some people who may have to work on that day.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although there are a number of pros and cons to having a public holiday to celebrate the contributions of historically marginalised groups, we believe that in this case the pros outweigh the cons. We feel that by making such a day a public holiday it would increase public awareness and respect for historically marginalised groups. Furthermore, having such a holiday would serve to remind people of how we as a nation profited from the exploitation of such groups. We also think that making a day a public holiday is an easy way for people to celebrate the contributions of historically marginalised groups. Although there are many historically marginalised groups, and some people argue that making a day a public holiday for every single one would be impractical, we believe that this can be easily overcome. We think that one day can be a general public holiday for all historically marginalised groups. If that was not possible, we think that a different day could be chosen for different historically marginalised groups. In conclusion, we believe that making a public holiday to celebrate the contributions of historically marginalised groups would be a good idea. We feel that this would serve to increase public awareness and respect for such groups, and help to right historical wrongs.
