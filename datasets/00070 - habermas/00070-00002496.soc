# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of banning plastic packaging. The group felt that it was not necessary and that there were many alternatives that could be used. The group felt that plastic packaging is very harmful to the environment and that it is very difficult to recycle. The group felt that plastic packaging should be banned, however, there are some products that require packaging for hygiene reasons. The group felt that we should be working towards a place where plastic packaging should be stopped.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a ban on plastic packaging. However, they did acknowledge that in some cases plastic packaging was necessary. For example, food hygiene is an important issue and in some cases plastic packaging is the best way to ensure this. They also recognised that in some cases plastic packaging was the best way to protect a product and ensure it was not damaged in transit. They felt that the issue was not so much the banning of plastic packaging but more about the development of more sustainable alternatives to plastic packaging. The group felt that it was important that people were made more aware of the problems caused by plastic packaging and the damage it does to the environment. They felt that the more people were made aware of the problems caused by plastic packaging the more likely they were to support a ban on plastic packaging.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Plastic packaging should be banned. The effect of plastic on the natural environment is greatly understated. A lot of it is totally unnecessary. It damages the environment and it not recyclable . I believe biodegradable alternatives should be used which are probably cheaper to produce and are less harmful to future generations. Plastic packaging should be banned in order to help our environment, cost and climate control. Plastic ends up in our ocean and is bad for the animals. Also, what about micro plastics, they are awful for everybody and are poison. Ban plastic packaging now.

This is a difficult one, no I don't think we should ban the sale of all things with plastic packaging, something probably need to have plastic packaging on them in some capacity. However, we should be working towards a place where plastic packaging should be stopped. Plastic packaging should be banned in order to help our environment, cost and climate control. Plastic ends up in our ocean and is bad for the animals. Also, what about micro plastics, they are awful for everybody and are poison. Ban plastic packaging now. No, I don't think we should ban the sale of all things with plastic packaging. I do believe we should attempt to significantly reduce plastic packaging by using sustainable alternatives that can be recycled or composted, however, I think there are some products that require packaging for hygiene reasons.
