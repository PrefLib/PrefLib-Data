# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the consensus that the rise of the internet has increased loneliness. We feel that it is social media in particular that has been the cause, as mentioned above. The algorithms that drive the likes on Instagram and Facebook actually cause the opposite effect to that intended - they make us feel worse about ourselves, which is the opposite of what social media was meant to do. It was meant to be a place to express ourselves, connect with others and share our lives - but it has become a place where we look at others, rather than ourselves, and feel inferior.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The rise of the internet has not caused loneliness. This answer is backed up by a variety of academic studies, which have shown that overall levels of loneliness have remained steady, despite the rise of the internet. It is important to distinguish between the internet and social media, however, as there are many studies which show that social media in particular can contribute to feelings of loneliness. This is likely because social media algorithms are designed to keep users scrolling and scrolling on the platform, and users can become addicted to this. Social media is also shown to give people a false sense of connection to others, and some people believe they have many friends online but don't realise that they don't have any real, human friendships. It is these people who may feel lonely, but this is an issue of not making an effort to go out and meet people. The internet is not a cause of loneliness - but it is an enabler of loneliness.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the rise of the internet has not caused loneliness. However, social media in particular is a different story.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, we believe that the rise of the internet has caused loneliness. The issue of the internet being a cause of loneliness is a complex one. However, it is becoming more evident with time. The issue is made more complex by the fact that in some situations, the internet has actually brought people together and helped to reduce loneliness. Nevertheless, the overuse of the internet, especially social media, has made the issue of loneliness worse.
