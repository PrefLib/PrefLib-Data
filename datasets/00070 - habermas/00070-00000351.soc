# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The majority of the group thought that nuclear power was needed for energy security, however we did think that it was a highly political issue and that the public should be involved in the decision. Some thought that the benefits outweighed the risks, others thought the opposite.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of nuclear power, although with reservations. We had different opinions on whether to build a new power station or not, but overall felt that the climate change issues outweigh the dangers of a new station. We thought that the people in the vicinity should have a say in whether it should be built or not, as it is a hot political topic and could cause uproar. However, we do think that it is a vital and much needed source of energy, and should be researched further.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There is a strong argument for building a new nuclear power station, and nuclear power is a key part of the energy mix in the future. There are benefits and risks to the environment and community, and the public should be involved in the decision.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group, in general, was in favour of nuclear power, although with reservations. We had different opinions on whether to build a new power station or not, but overall felt that the climate change issues outweigh the dangers of a new station. We thought that the people in the vicinity should have a say in whether it should be built or not, as it is a hot political topic and could cause uproar.
