# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although banning them would have a very small benefit for the environment,  I feel they have more positives than negatives as they're regularly used for parties and events which can save people a lot of time and effort. Also smaller businesses that rely on these will have a massive cost increase if these were to be banned - which will also lead to businesses closing and more job losses. Lastly, with the amount of restrictive laws being introduced the public may start to become frustrated - especially when China, Russia and the USA contribute 40% of the CO2 emissions and they then have to give up their paper plates.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I think it's an excellent goal to move towards, but I'm concerned about how to get there. There are times when we need a disposable option with things such as this, or the reliance is so ingrained it would take years for the country to adjust. I think if there were incentives for businesses and customers to move towards reusable when single use is what is usual, then that would help that shift. But an outright ban would be too sudden, and likely not effective, which may lead to them having to back track on the policy. I think alternatives like bamboo forks etc as disposable are better. I think looking at plastics and our inability to recycle properly are more pertinent issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I am assuming this refers to single use plastic which is non bio-degradable which I think is definitely a problem and should be banned. If we are including materials that are easily recycled such as bamboo then I would say they should be limited in use but I can understand the need for them in certain situations e.g. at festivals. It would harm areas of hospitality to ban them completely and there should be an alternative option. As with paper straws, this seems to be the tip of a bigger iceberg and that there are other areas of single use items that should be dealt with first and a focus on things that wouldn't cause a huge problem for small businesses e.g. removing unnecessary plastic packaging.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think a blanket ban on single-use plates and cutlery would not be the wise decision. 'Single-use' doesn't have to mean 'carbon-intensive'. Paper plates and wooden cutlery are made from renewable resources, and also have the opportunity to be recycled. Removing single-use items like paper plates just means items will be manufactured via another, potentially more carbon-intensive source, such as plastic, which are technically not 'Single-use' but easily breakable and then non-recyclable. Decisions like this should be consumer-led: If there is demand for those types of items, then manufacture them, and focus on reducing the carbon intensity as much as possible. If there is no demand, then likewise reduce supply to match.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 -  I think it would help long term in saving the planet and helping the environment etc However I feel that there are more urgent matters that need to be addressed in society and a ban now could negatively impact some already struggling businesses. I think a more gradual solution would be  more beneficial going forward.
