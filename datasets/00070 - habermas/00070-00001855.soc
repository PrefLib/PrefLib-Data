# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is widely accepted that we use too much plastic in packaging and this is a large cause of environmental damage. However, I feel that this is a huge issue and we need to find the most effective way to stop this. Although I understand there are alternatives to plastic, I feel that banning the sale of items with plastic packaging will be counterproductive. As Participant 4 said, some items need plastic packaging to stay fresh or even safe. I believe that we need to make changes, however we need to find the most effective ways to do this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should ban the sale of all things with plastic packaging.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although we should move towards banning the sale of all things with plastic packaging, it is not currently possible to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that plastic packaging should be banned, but not completely. We think that it is important to look at the alternatives to plastic packaging, but that it is also important to use plastic packaging where necessary. We think that we should not ban plastic packaging completely because it is not always the best option. We think that there are other ways to cut down on the use of plastic packaging, such as making it more expensive.
