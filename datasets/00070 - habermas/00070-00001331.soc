# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While we all agree that social media plays a vital role in the dissemination of information, we also acknowledge that sometimes information that is shared may be false, inflammatory or otherwise harmful.   The consensus is that the government can take steps to regulate social media, particularly in the areas of protection of personal data and ensuring the information shared is factually correct.  It is however important to ensure that the government regulation does not infringe on the rights of users to express their views freely and also does not hinder independent journalism.  In order to ensure that the government regulation is fair and just, it is vital that the government is monitored by an independent body.
