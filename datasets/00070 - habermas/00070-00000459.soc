# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the idea of selling organs to save the life of another person seems to be one that is inherently good. However, the risk of exploitation of people in difficult situations, the loss of dignity for the person who sold the organ, and the strong possibility of organ trafficking is something that makes it a morally repugnant idea. While the need for a system where more organs are available for people who need them is pressing, this system would seem to bring too many problems with it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should not be allowed to buy and sell organs. This question is the third in a series of questions posed to the “consensus”. The first question was: 1.    Should we allow people to carry guns? The participants’ answers were as follows: ·         YES. Providing that people are properly trained in the safe use of guns and that guns are securely stored and transported, there should be no issue with allowing people to carry guns. ·         NO. The reason being that guns are inherently dangerous and that accidents happen even when people are properly trained. ·         YES. Providing that guns are only issued to those people who are law abiding citizens.  The right to self-defense is fundamental. ·         NO. The level of danger is too great. The consensus was therefore reached that people should not be allowed to carry guns. The second question was: 2.    Should the sale of drugs be legalized? The participants’ answers were as follows: ·
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be no market for organs, they should be donated freely and fairly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should not be able to buy and sell organs on a market. It would be too easy for criminals to exploit this and would not be a fair way of distributing organs to people in need.
