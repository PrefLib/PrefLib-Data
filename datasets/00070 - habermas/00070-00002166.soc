They should not be forced to take care of elderly people, but should be encouraged to visit their relatives and treat them with respect. If they then decide that they would like to make it their profession, they should be encouraged to do so, provided it is what they really want to do. If everyone in society was kind and respected others, elderly people would not feel as lonely and isolated as they sometimes do.
