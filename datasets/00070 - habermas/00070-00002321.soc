# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is a global population crisis. While we are not over-populated in the traditional sense of living space, we are in terms of food, water and energy. Our impact on the climate of the planet is not sustainable and is likely to have dire consequences in the future. We are also likely to be the architects of our own downfall if we do not change our practices. The issue of overpopulation is an important one and one that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the world is over-populated. The world's population is growing at an exponential rate, and this is causing many problems for the planet. The effects of climate change are starting to be felt, and the world's resources are becoming increasingly scarce. This is leading to the rise of poverty in many places, and a greater divide between the rich and poor. The world's population is also causing the world's infrastructure to buckle. In Malta, for example, the population is causing a great strain on the country's infrastructure, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to provide for everyone. Malta is also becoming increasingly polluted, and the country is becoming more and more congested.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the world is overpopulated. This is evident in the increasing shortage of resources and the rising prices of goods. We are also seeing the effects of this in climate change, as the planet is unable to cope with the demands of the human population. The world is also seeing a vast inequality in the distribution of wealth, with a large portion of the population living in poverty, while a small minority enjoy a life of luxury. The world is not able to sustain this inequality, and it is also not sustainable in the long run.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the world is overpopulated. There are simply too many people living on Earth, and the impact this has had on the environment is detrimental. The climate is changing, and many places are running out of food and water. The resources we have are being depleted at an alarming rate. There is a huge gap between the rich and the poor, with many people living in poverty while a few live in luxury. The current infrastructure in many countries is not able to support their current population, and this is only going to get worse as the population continues to grow. However, there are some places in the world where the population is not a problem. These places are able to provide for their people, and are able to live sustainably. The issue of overpopulation is therefore a matter of perspective.
