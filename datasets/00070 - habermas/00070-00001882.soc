# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to a ban on all non-essential cosmetic surgery. The group felt that people should have the right to access surgery if they want it and feel it would benefit them in their lives. The group did not think that non-essential cosmetic surgery should be available on the NHS, as there is only limited budget available and so essential medical procedures should always take precedence. However, the group felt that if a person can afford to pay for it themselves and they're not harming anyone by doing it then they see no reason why it should be banned. The group felt that it can be regulated to make sure people aren't getting it done when they're too young, but they don't think it should be banned.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, we do not think that all non-essential cosmetic surgery should be banned. Whilst there are negative health implications associated with some types of cosmetic surgery, there are also many examples where surgery can improve the lives of those who undergo it. For example, in the case of people with disabilities, non-essential cosmetic surgery may be considered essential, for example a cosmetic procedure may help a person to see or hear properly. In addition, for some people, non-essential cosmetic surgery may be beneficial to their mental health, for example breast augmentation surgery. We believe that people should be allowed to undergo non-essential cosmetic surgery if they are over 18 and have given their informed consent.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of cosmetic surgery. However, it was felt that cosmetic surgery should not be available on the NHS, as there is only limited budget available and so essential medical procedures should always take precedence. The group felt that cosmetic surgery should not be available to those under the age of 18, as it can be damaging to a person's self-esteem.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We do not think that all non-essential cosmetic surgery should be banned, but believe that it should be regulated, with surgeries being only available to those over the age of 18.
