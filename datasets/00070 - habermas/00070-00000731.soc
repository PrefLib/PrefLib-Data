# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Tech companies should not be forced to block pornography or gambling. These are two very different issues. Pornography is a freedom of expression issue and the right to access pornography is protected by law. Pornography should not be blocked as it is not illegal. However, the content of pornography needs to be looked at and regulated. We do not agree that gambling should be blocked but gambling sites should be regulated and age restrictions should be put in place. Gambling can be very addictive and cause people to lose a lot of money, therefore it should be looked at and regulated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, providing that matters do not cause significant harm, we are in favour of content on the internet being unmoderated/free. Individuals should have the liberty to access this content if they choose to do so. However, the content may need to be regulated to an extent to prevent e.g. access by minors or access by those with gambling addictions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be age restrictions on both pornography and gambling sites. The gambling sites should have spending limits to help prevent gambling addiction.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the internet should remain a place for free speech and expression, however in cases where it is deemed that certain content can be harmful to people in a certain way, it should be regulated. The issue of gambling addiction is a difficult one, as it can be argued that people have a choice whether to gamble or not. The issue of children accessing pornography is also difficult, as this is a freedom of speech issue. However, if the content is deemed to be harmful to children, it should be regulated.
