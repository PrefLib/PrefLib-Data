# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We have come to a consensus view that building new roads can help to relieve congestion. We all think this will be good for local residents who are suffering with congestion but we feel there needs to be other measures implemented to improve the situation. We also think that the additional new roads may lead to increased car usage which will in turn lead to an increase in CO2 emissions which we all agree is bad for the environment. However, we also think that this can be mitigated by the building of more public transport links to the city centre which would be great for people who don’t want to drive but would like to access the city centre. In conclusion, we all think that building new roads is good to relieve congestion but this needs to be part of a wider strategy of transportation improvements to really relieve the pressure on the roads in the area.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be the creation of new roads as well as the improvement of public transport.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the addition of new roads to relieve the pressure on existing congested roads is an effective way to reduce congestion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Ultimately, yes we should build new roads, but in a very specific way. In some cases congestion may be due to an accident or something like that which will then require a new road to be built. However, there should be no exception in these cases to providing adequate space for public transport, walking and cycling. We must be wary of the dangers of inducing new car traffic and that new roads must be integrated into the transport system to relieve congestion. This will also be important in the sense that it is important to recognise the scale of the road we wish to build and if it will have a positive or negative impact on the environment. The consensus statement below takes into account these things.”
