# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The average person does not need a car. The definition of average is very broad and includes people who live in cities as well as in rural areas. Public transport is more readily available in cities, whereas in rural areas, a car is a necessity. The cost of owning and maintaining a car can be very high, and this is a deterrent for many. However, the freedom that a car offers cannot be denied, and this is the reason why many people choose to own a car.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Most people don't need a car. However it's a convenience thing, especially for people living in the countryside. There are ways of getting around without one. If you live in a big city you can just take public transport or cycle etc.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It all depends on the situation and on how we define an average person. What do we mean by an average person? For some people in the world, they don't have a choice, they can't afford to buy a car. Public transportation in some countries is not good and having your own car is the only way to get around. Some people need to drive because of their jobs and their situation, living in the countryside or in the middle of nowhere. It's hard to say. Everyone has different situations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the average person does not need a car. However, this is highly dependent on the location of the person, and whether or not they live in a rural or urban area. In a rural area, the average person is more likely to need a car, as there is often no other form of transport available. In an urban area, the average person is less likely to need a car, as there are often many forms of public transport available, and it is often possible to walk or cycle to many places.
