# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK government should not fund a new high speed rail link between London and Edinburgh.  The fiasco that is HS2 has shown us that the government is not capable of delivering major infrastructure projects on time or on budget.  There is also no need for this high speed rail link.  The last few years have shown us that business can be done remotely using Zoom type apps, there is no need for face to face meetings.  This kind of long distance rail travel is a thing of the past.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the UK government should not fund a new high speed rail link between London and Edinburgh. There is currently a direct line between the two capital cities and funds for this long line to be upgraded to HS would be better used elsewhere. There has already been much controversy over the implementation of HS rail lines and protests over routes by home and land owners. The route would also cut through many areas of outstanding natural beauty and would be detrimental to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “The UK government should not fund a new high speed rail link between London and Edinburgh.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the UK government should not fund a new high speed rail link between London and Edinburgh.  The current direct line between the two capital cities is adequate and funds for this long line to be upgraded to HS would be better used elsewhere.  There has already been much controversy over the implementation of HS rail lines and protests over routes by home and land owners.  This kind of long distance rail travel is a thing of the past.
