# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “The UK should maintain its current levels of defence spending. Defence spending is important to our country and our security. However, we need to make sure that it is spent efficiently and not wasted. We should increase our spending on defence if we see an increase in the threat level to our country.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group of participants were split on this question. The participants with a pro-defence spending view believed that the current spending levels should be maintained due to the current economic climate. However, the participants with an anti-defence spending view believed that the current spending levels should be reduced in order to help other areas of the economy. Therefore, the group of participants came to the following consensus view: The current levels of defence spending should be maintained, however, in the long-term a gradual reduction in defence spending should occur.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should maintain its current levels of defence spending. This is due to the fact that the threat from terrorism has increased, and the threat from other countries such as Russia is also increasing. Also, the UK's current levels of defence spending is important to maintain jobs in the defence sector, and is also an important part of the UK's economy. The group also felt that there is a need to maintain a balance between the UK's current levels of defence spending, and the UK's other public spending priorities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the UK should maintain its current levels of defence spending, but should continue to look for ways to make the armed forces more efficient.
