# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the vegan lifestyle and thought that it was making a positive contribution to the world. The group thought that veganism was a good way to reduce the impact of climate change, and to improve animal welfare. The group did not think that the vegan lifestyle was the only way to reduce climate change, and thought that reducing meat and dairy consumption would also be beneficial. The group also thought that the vegan lifestyle was not the easiest lifestyle to live, and that it would be hard to maintain in the long term. The group thought that veganism was a good way to raise awareness of climate change and animal welfare, but that it could also alienate people. The group thought that it was important for vegans to research the origin of the products they buy and how big a carbon footprint, especially vegan ready meals,  have. The group thought that veganism alone does not improve animal welfare, and that animal welfare should be improved in food production regardless of veganism.
