# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should continue to fund educational programs to help people learn as this would be beneficial for all of humanity but that we should do this in the most equitable way possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should fund research into educational programs on how to make humans smarter. However, this research should be done so that it is not only financially available to those who can afford it. The research should be universally available to all so that all humans can benefit from it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of funding the research. The group believes that humans can be made smarter. However, they are aware of the danger of getting caught up in the race for smarter and smarter humans, and are keen that the research funded is done in an ethical manner. The group believe that it should be possible to have smarter humans, and a fairer society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group of participants were broadly in favour of increasing funding to education. This was mostly because they felt that increasing funding to education would help close the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have nots' and increase the ability of all individuals to lead successful and fulfilling lives. There was a worry however that increasing funding to education might not increase the ability of all individuals to lead successful and fulfilling lives. Participants felt that this was because the funding might be spent in the wrong areas or in an inefficient way.  Participant 4 said "you can't make a person smarter without that person wanting to be smarter." The group of participants also felt that there were broader societal issues that need to be addressed to help children to achieve their potential, e.g. poverty and violence.
