# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is acceptable to drive across the country to visit a friend despite the carbon cost. This is only an issue if the friend lives in an urban area where public transport is readily available and driving is thus not the only option. In cases where public transport is not readily available and the friend lives in a rural area, the carbon cost can be mitigated by offsetting it by donating to an organization that helps to mitigate climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The carbon cost of driving is only an issue if it is a very long distance and the cost to travel by public transport is affordable and not inconvenient. If the friend lives in a rural area, public transport may be non-existent. The carbon cost is then mitigated if the friend lives in a home that uses solar panels and/or wind turbines to generate their own electricity and heat. The carbon cost is also mitigated if the driver chooses to offset the carbon emissions by donating to an organization that helps to mitigate climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: If the friend lives in a rural area, public transport may be non-existent. The carbon cost is then mitigated if the friend lives in a home that uses solar panels and/or wind turbines to generate their own electricity and heat. The carbon cost is also mitigated if the driver chooses to offset the carbon emissions by donating to an organization that helps to mitigate climate change. The final consensus statement has addressed all of the critiques. All of the participants felt that they were adequately represented in the final consensus view.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Driving across the country to visit a friend is OK, but there is a carbon cost which must be mitigated if possible. This can be done by taking a train or bus if that is feasible, donating to a charity that works to mitigate climate change, and offsetting the carbon cost of the car.
