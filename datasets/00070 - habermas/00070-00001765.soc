# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Companies should be allowed to have a zero-tolerance policy on the use of social media by their employees.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, companies should not be allowed to have a zero-tolerance policy on the use of social media by their employees. The right to free speech is paramount and should always be allowed. It is very situational regarding companies about what can be said on social media, but generally speaking it is reasonable to enforce a zero tolerance policy on grounds of brand protection.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Companies should not have a zero-tolerance policy on the use of social media by their employees.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While it is important for companies to maintain control over their brand and their public image, employees also have the right to have a private life. We feel that in most cases, a zero tolerance policy is too strict. We therefore advocate for a very tolerant policy. While we recommend that companies should be allowed to monitor the use of social media by their employees, they should be allowed to use social media for their own personal uses. If they are found to be saying anything which may be illegal or illegal or cause a detrimental effect on the company's brand image, they should be sanctioned. The sanctions should be fair and appropriate for the situation.
