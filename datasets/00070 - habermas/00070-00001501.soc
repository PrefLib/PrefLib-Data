# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The Government should set targets for reducing the UK’s carbon emissions. There are now many who have reached the conclusion that the effects of climate change are already being felt with record-breaking floods, extreme heat waves and an increase in the frequency of forest fires, just to mention a few. Although there are still some who don’t believe in climate change, the overwhelming evidence is that it is real and that it is now too late to reverse the impact of man-made global warming. The consequences of the worst predictions, as predicted by the IPCC, would be disastrous for mankind. The Government must take the lead in setting a realistic timetable for achieving a reduction in the UK’s carbon emissions and to ensure that this is effectively enforced.   The following is a summary of the issues discussed in the process of reaching this conclusion. The scientific evidence for global warming is now overwhelming. There is no doubt that this is already happening and that the UK and all countries must take the action required to reduce their carbon emissions. However, the consensus view of the group is that there are many factors to be considered in setting the targets. The most important is that they are realistic. This can be ensured by a gradual reduction, giving industry
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “The government should set targets for reducing the UK’s carbon emissions. This will not only be beneficial for the environment, but will also help to encourage businesses to reduce their emissions, which will be better for the economy in the long term.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK government should set targets for reducing the UK’s carbon emissions. This is because the UK is one of the largest contributors to global carbon emissions and it is important that we are held accountable for our actions. This would also force businesses to reduce their emissions, which would be a positive step in the right direction. The UK government should also set targets for reducing the UK’s carbon emissions as we have already seen the effects of climate change and it is important that we take action now to prevent further damage. The issue of climate change is something which has been in the public eye for many years now. There is a huge amount of research which has been conducted into the topic, which has led to a consensus view amongst scientists that climate change is a very real threat to the future of our planet. There are a number of ways in which the issue of climate change can be tackled, however the most important thing is that it is tackled. If we continue to live our lives in the way that we currently are, then we are only going to make the situation worse. It is important that we take action now, to prevent further damage to our planet.
