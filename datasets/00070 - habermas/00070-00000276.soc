# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We have come to a consensus view that building new roads can help to relieve congestion and will be good for local residents who are suffering with congestion. However, we feel there needs to be other measures implemented to improve the situation. We all think this will also lead to less pollution as there will be less traffic jams and congestion throughout the road network. This is an important part of the solution but should be taken in hand with other smaller measures just as increased bus network availability. In conclusion, we all think that building new roads is good to relieve congestion but this needs to be part of a wider strategy of transportation improvements to really relieve the pressure on the roads in the area.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “We have come to a consensus view that building new roads can help to relieve congestion. However, it needs to be part of a wider strategy of transportation developments in the area and not just building new roads. This should include the introduction of more public transport links and incentives to help reduce the number of people using cars in the city centre. This will also help to reduce the CO2 emissions in the city which we all think is a positive thing.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “We have come to a consensus view that building new roads can help to relieve congestion. We all think this will be good for local residents who are suffering with congestion but we feel there needs to be other measures implemented to improve the situation. We also think that the additional new roads may lead to increased car usage which will in turn lead to an increase in CO2 emissions which we all agree is bad for the environment. However, we also think that this can be mitigated by the building of more public transport links to the city centre which would be great for people who don’t want to drive but would like to access the city centre. In conclusion, we all think that building new roads is good to relieve congestion but this needs to be part of a wider strategy of transportation improvements to really relieve the pressure on the roads in the area.”

Conclusion: The example demonstrates how difficult it can be to reach a consensus opinion. It also demonstrates how some of the participants could come to a final consensus opinion despite having different individual opinions.
