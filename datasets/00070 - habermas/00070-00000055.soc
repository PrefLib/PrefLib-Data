# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the government is not doing enough to tackle child obesity. However, government cannot tackle the causes of child obesity as doing so may hurt the profits of the food manufacturing companies who have a very strong lobby position and can influence government policy. Instead, they should be more active in providing support for schools and parents.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government has been slow to act on child obesity and in many ways is still failing to act. This is largely due to the lobbying power of big business and think tanks like the Institute of Economic Affairs. The government should demand that schools ensure their pupils are more active and take part in meaningful physical education. Also, the government should be more active in its efforts to crack down on the advertising of harmful snacks to children. Finally, the government should not just add sugar taxes to products but should rather provide more help in the form of vouchers towards salads/vegetables and even vouchers for children's gym access.  Participants were also asked to rank some key priorities of government, using the following ranking scale.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government is failing to tackle child obesity. They need to improve public education on healthy eating and reduce the amount of junk food advertising aimed at children. They should also provide more opportunities for children to be active at school and should look at the possibility of increasing the price of unhealthy foods through taxation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government is failing to tackle child obesity. They should not be afraid to intervene to help reduce this problem and introduce more stringent regulation and penalties for companies that advertise harmful snacks and foods to children. The government should also take action against companies who add excessive amounts of sugar and salt to their products. The health of the nation's children is too important to be left in the hands of big business.
