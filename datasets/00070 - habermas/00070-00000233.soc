# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the UK government should invest more in infrastructure, particularly with regard to public transport in London and major cities. This would be particularly beneficial to help support the environment and help reduce carbon emissions. In addition, better and improved infrastructure will provide better transport links to support the economy and make transport more accessible to all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group agrees that the government should invest more in infrastructure. More money is needed to bring current infrastructure up to the new standard. To accommodate this we need better infrastructure. The government should invest more to improve our roads. With more money spent on roads and improvements we could also use it instead to reduce the number of immigrants coming to the UK and thus reduce overpopulation. With less money spent on benefits we could use it instead to improve roads.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK's infrastructure is in woefully poor condition compared to other countries both in Europe and the other continents. Arguably privatisation has led to the degradation of investment and quality in favour of shareholder return in sectors such as rail and water. There is a need to reverse this trend. Additionally wider infrastructure such as roads and the services provided alongside new housing developments need to be improved and this can only really come from increased investment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “The government should increase its investment in infrastructure, for the country to prosper. The current levels of investment are clearly insufficient as shown by our outdated transport and communication systems.”
