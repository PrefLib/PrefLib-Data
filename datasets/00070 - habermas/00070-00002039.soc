# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: We do not think it is ethical to cut down ancient forests to grow food.  The forests have been around for thousands of years and are a part of our history.  The ancient forests are also home to many different species of animals and plants and if we were to cut them down, these species might become extinct.  Also, we do not know what new diseases might be found in these forests or from the animals living there that could save our lives.  The ancient forests also help to keep our air clean and if we were to cut them down, the air quality would become worse and this would have a negative impact on our health.  There are many other places that we could grow food, and therefore we should not cut down the ancient forests.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the conclusion that it is not ethical to cut down ancient forests in order to grow food for humans.

The ancient forests also help to keep our air clean and if we were to cut them down, the air quality would become worse and this would have a negative impact on our health.  There are many other places that we could grow food, and therefore we should not cut down the ancient forests.  We should also look at farming practices and how we can improve them to produce more food, without having to cut down any trees.
