# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the citizen's jury felt that the current school system in New Zealand was in need of a major overhaul.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Citizen's Jury
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should receive sex education in school, parents should not be allowed to opt out of this education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Sex education is very important in schools, as it is not always something that is spoken about at home. We are living in a society where sex and sexual orientation are more accepted and are becoming more common. Sex education can give children the tools and knowledge they need to be safe in sexual situations and it can help them understand themselves better. We all feel that if children were not to get sex education in school then they would be missing out on something very important that they will use in their lives and will help them to be safe. We feel that parents should not be allowed to opt their children out of sex education, as it is such a vital part of growing up and learning how to keep yourself safe.
