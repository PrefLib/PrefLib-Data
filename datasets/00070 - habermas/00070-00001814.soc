# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should limit the number of times a person can run for political office. It is not healthy for democracy to let individuals cling to power indefinitely. Ideas may get stagnant and this may lead to a lack to progress. There should be fresh candidates to bring new attitudes and projects to the table. It would not be possible to advance and go forward politically without new political leaders. There are those cases where a politician may be well liked, have a strong background and clear, popular and successful plans, and that is of course acceptable, however people have to come to be aware that term limits are an important consideration in a fair political system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should limit the number of times a person can run for political office. It is not healthy for democracy to let individuals cling to power indefinitely. Ideas may get stagnant and this may lead to a lack to progress. There should be fresh candidates to bring new attitudes and projects to the table. It would not be possible to advance and go forward politically without new political leaders. The term limits will help encourage a healthy functioning political system with wider participation. This consensus view was then presented to the entire group of participants as an example of how it is important to debate and criticize, but at the same time important to listen to the views of others and come to a common consensus. The entire group then broke up into smaller groups of 5 people and each smaller group was tasked with coming up with their own consensus view on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft of a consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement by the participants, and the final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
