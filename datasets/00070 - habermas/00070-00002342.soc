# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of imposing capital gains tax on property owners who profit from rising house prices. The group felt that the tax would be unfair as it would penalise those who have worked hard to buy their own home. It was felt that the tax would be ineffective in solving the problem of rising house prices as the tax would not prevent people from buying property and would not make housing more affordable. The group felt that the issue of rising house prices is a complex one and that there is no simple solution. It was felt that the government needs to do more to help people onto the property ladder such as by building more affordable housing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we should not impose a capital gains tax on property owners who profit from rising house prices. The issue of rising house prices is more complex than simply imposing a capital gains tax and is not necessarily the best way to tackle the issue. A tax on second homes which are empty for most of the year may be a better way to go about this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of a capital gains tax on property owners who profit from rising house prices. However, it was felt that this should be dependent on the number of properties owned by the individual. If it was their only property then they should not be taxed on the increase in value. If it was their second property then they should be taxed on the increase in value. If it was their third property then they should be taxed on the increase in value and so on.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, we should not impose a capital gains tax on property owners who profit from rising house prices. The tax would only impact those who can already afford to buy a house in the first place. The tax would not help first time buyers or the working classes to get on the property ladder in a housing market which continues to inflate despite prevailing circumstances such as COVID and high interest rates. Making housing more accessible is the problem that needs to be solved at its core rather than creating new taxes or simply raising interest rates which time and time again has not worked.
