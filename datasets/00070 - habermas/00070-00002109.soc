# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The King should be allowed to have a TikTok account, however the content he posts must be vetted due to his position and status within the political sphere. As such, he may use social media but in a restricted manner under the supervision of advisors.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The King should be allowed to have a TikTok account, but under strict guidelines to maintain his status and position within the government. This was a difficult topic for participants to discuss, but they were able to reach a consensus and were able to articulate their views in a logical, coherent manner. The students did not go through any process of acculturation, it was just a case of discussing their views. However, I do believe that this debate was an important step in allowing participants to see and understand the point of view of others, which in the future may have an impact on their acculturation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The King should be allowed to have a TikTok account, however the content he posts must be vetted due to his position and status within the political sphere. The account must be educational and professional in nature. The account must be used to connect with the youth of the UK and other countries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The king should be allowed a TikTok account but under certain conditions. The king is a public figure and as such should be seen as a role model for the youth of today. The king should be allowed a TikTok account so long as he has a strict control over the content he posts. He is not allowed to do or say things that are deemed inappropriate. TikTok is a platform for the youth, therefore the king needs to ensure that his content does not negatively impact on the views of the youth. His TikTok account should be used to encourage children to be productive. He can create TikToks about the nature of his role in society and how important it is for him to perform his duties to the best of his ability. He should also use his TikTok account to promote a healthy lifestyle and give out some general life advice.
