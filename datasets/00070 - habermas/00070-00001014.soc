# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A white lie is a harmless untruth that is told to make someone feel better.  We have all told white lies and we will continue to do so in the future.  They are usually told to avoid hurting someone's feelings or to make the other person feel better.  We believe it is OK to tell a white lie as long as it doesn't cause any harm or lead to more lies being told.  White lies can also be used to save time and avoid conflict.  The only time it is not OK to tell a white lie is if it leads to more lies being told.  This can cause problems as the truth will eventually come out and this can lead to more problems.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of telling white lies.  We felt that in some circumstances it is better to tell a white lie in order to avoid upsetting people and to preserve one's credibility.  However, we were also aware that it is very easy for a white lie to become a bigger lie which can lead to further problems.  We were in favour of telling white lies as long as they are told with good intentions and don't lead to further problems.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, it is not a good idea to tell a lie as it can lead to further problems and is not an honest way to live your life.  However, there are circumstances when it is acceptable to tell a lie.  If the lie is to protect someone and does not cause harm to anyone, then it is acceptable to tell a lie.  If the lie is to make someone feel better and is not going to cause any problems, then it is acceptable to tell a lie.  The lie has to be for a good reason and not to cover up something bad.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: A white lie is the term used to describe a harmless or trivial lie, usually told to avoid hurting someone's feelings. White lies are usually told to spare someone's feelings, or to protect someone from being hurt or upset. The consensus view of the group was that white lies are sometimes OK but should be used sparingly and with care. The group felt that if a lie could cause harm, even if it is a white lie, it should not be told. If a lie is discovered it could cause embarrassment and lead to further problems. The group felt that white lies are sometimes used to smooth social situations and can be used to avoid conflict. They felt that white lies are sometimes used to save time and are often used in business situations. The group felt that people should be honest and truthful but sometimes white lies are used to help people and make them feel better.
