# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We all agreed that both being a good person and a happy person are equally important. In fact, it is difficult to achieve one without the other. A key insight, particularly from Participant 1, was that sometimes sacrificing the happiness of one person can improve overall happiness for others. There was a general agreement that if you cannot be happy with yourself, and be happy in life in general, this will have a knock-on effect on those around you, and particularly your relationships with others. We also noted that focusing too much on being a good person can lead to neglecting yourself, which in turn can lead to people taking advantage, or not setting personal boundaries. To be a happy person, you must be good to yourself, as well as others. This was our final consensus.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is equally important to be a good person as well as a happy person. This is because if you are not happy, this will inevitably affect your relationships with others. Similarly, if you are not a good person, this will negatively affect your relationships with others and also yourself. Therefore, both things come hand in hand, and there is no point in sacrificing your own happiness or that of others. However, it is also important to set boundaries and focus on your own happiness and wellbeing, as this will help you to be a better person to others.
