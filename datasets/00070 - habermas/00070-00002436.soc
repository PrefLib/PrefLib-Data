# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, we have come to the decision that it is fair to ban parents from smoking in the car if a child is present. This is because children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of smoking due to their developing respiratory systems. It is the parents responsibility to protect their children and smoking in the car can cause car accidents. Smoking can cause asthma and other breathing problems in children. Children have no choice but to inhale the smoke and this can cause harm to them later in life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, the group has come to the consensus opinion that it is fair to ban parents from smoking in the car if a child is present. This is because the child will be inhaling the smoke which can cause them harm later on in life. The parent driving could also be distracted by smoking which can cause car accidents just like when people use their phones. It is the parents responsibility to protect their child and not put them at risk. The health and well being of the child should be the top priority. Children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of smoking due to their developing respiratory systems, and so they should be protected from it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, the group of participants believe that it is fair to ban parents from smoking in the car if a child is present. The health and well being of the child should be the top priority. Children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of smoking due to their developing respiratory systems. The child has no choice but to inhale the smoke and will be exposed to the harmful effects of second hand smoke. The parent driving could also be distracted by smoking which can cause car accidents just like when people use their phones. It is the parent's choice if they want to damage their own health, but this should not be inflicted on the child. They have said that smoking can damage your health and have warnings on the packs, how is that fair on the poor child who has no choice. The group of participants believe that the health of the child should be the top priority and smoking in the car should be banned if a child is present.
