# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Doctors should be held liable for prescribing drugs that they know to be dangerous, as it is their duty of care to provide the safest and most effective treatment possible. As such, they must inform patients of the risks of the drugs they are prescribing. If they do not inform the patient, they must be liable for the damages. Moreover, we feel that patients should be given the option to sign a disclaimer upon accepting medication. The disclaimer should state that they accept the risk, and that they will not sue the doctor if they suffer the consequences. However, if the patient is below the age of 18, the disclaimer should not be valid, as they are legally children, and should not be forced to accept the risk of any medication. If they are under the age of 18, they must accept that their parents or legal guardians will sign the disclaimer. This will prevent patients from suing doctors, and will ensure that patients are fully aware of the risks.”

As such, they must inform patients of the risks of the drugs they are prescribing. If they do not inform the patient, they must be liable for the damages. Furthermore, the health service should provide training to doctors about how to advise patients of the risks of drugs they prescribe, as well as the interaction with other drugs the patient is taking.

However, if the patient is above the age of 18, the patient must sign a disclaimer before being prescribed medication. This will prevent patients from suing doctors, and will ensure that patients are fully aware of the risks.”
