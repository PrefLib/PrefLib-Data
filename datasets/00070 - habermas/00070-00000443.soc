# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the use of artificial insemination to enable parents to have a child with some of their own DNA. This was mainly because this might allow parents who might not otherwise be able to have their own children, the best chance at starting a family. The group felt that it was important for a child to share DNA with a parent, and if this was the only way for this to be achieved, it would be ethical. There were however concerns that this could be done for the wrong reasons, such as to try to recreate the family history, or to bring back an individual from the dead, but if this was not the case, it would be ethical. The group felt that religious beliefs should not play a part in the law-making process, and instead should be based on reason and scientific evidence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is ethical to use artificial insemination to allow a parent to have a child with some of their own DNA, provided the parent is of sound mind and the resulting child is guaranteed to be healthy and able to live a happy life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Artificial insemination is a method that can be used for multiple reasons, however we believe that it should be used as a last resort in situations where the parent has no other means of having a child with some of their own DNA. In conclusion, the use of artificial insemination is ethical when used in this manner.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the use of artificial insemination to allow a parent to have a child with some of their own DNA is ethical. Everyone should have the opportunity to have a child and if this is the best way to achieve this then it is ethical to use this method.
