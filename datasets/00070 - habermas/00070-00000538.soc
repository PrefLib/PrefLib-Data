# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Student loans should not carry interest.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, students should not be required to pay interest on their student loans. Education is so important, and we don't want to be discouraging people from studying. The student loans system is currently failing, and students should be getting better support from the government. It is important to note that this is a small sample of opinions. It is not a large enough sample size to come to any reliable conclusions on the matter. I'd be interested to hear what you think on the matter in the comments below.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to interest being charged on student loans. Although all group members recognised that a good education should be available to everyone and that students should contribute to the cost of their education, the group thought that interest rates on student loans should be kept as low as possible. The group felt that it was unfair to penalise those who have been educated, and also penalise their families, by requiring them to pay back more than the original loan. The group felt that it would be more sensible for the government to finance university places at higher rates and to charge low or zero interest rates on student loans.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, we feel that it would be unfair to add interest on to the loans, as most will not be able to pay back the loans anyway due to the current climate and the student debts being so high already. It would add an unnecessary burden and people may be put off going to university. We feel that the current model is not the best and a better funding model is required.
