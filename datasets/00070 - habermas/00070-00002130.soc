# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “While the concept of austerity is not without merit, there are significant flaws in the way that it has been applied. Firstly, austerity measures have been applied as a blanket, with no assessment of which services could afford a reduction in funding. Also, the measures have been applied to different sectors of the economy, with many businesses and corporations getting tax breaks and other forms of support, while austerity measures are applied to the public sector. These include businesses and corporations getting tax breaks, as well as funding to hire apprentices. In many cases, there are legitimate questions as to whether this is the best way to apply austerity measures. For example, a young person on a wage of minimum wage and without further qualifications is often better off staying on benefits rather than entering an apprenticeship scheme, so there are no incentives to do so. In contrast, if austerity measures were applied in a more rational and considered way, it could work well, with an assessment being made of which sectors could most afford a reduction in funding, and which services could be reduced without too much disruption to service users. Another way that austerity measures could be applied more rationally is through a greater focus on taxation, with the
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Austerity is not the best policy in an economic downturn. In the short term, it can lead to lower economic growth and higher unemployment. The cuts to social care spending also mean that the people who rely on it have no resources, which in some cases can lead to a higher death rate. There is a balance to be struck during an economic downturn. Government spending is lowered so more money is saved, however this is usually at the cost of many crucial services going underfunded. It is a tricky topic because it arguably affects the most vulnerable in our society more than it affects wealthy people. An increased tax to the wealthiest in society would probably be beneficial, however the wealthy among us do not like to pay any extra taxes. No, austerity is not the best policy in an economic downturn. It has been proven time and again in other countries that, paradoxically, increased spending is the way to reverse an economic downturn not austerity. All austerity does is cut public services off at the knees and provides a worse situation for most inhabitants in the long run. Austerity has been used numerous times in the UK by successive governments and has only resulted in a demolished and privatised public sector with infrastructure being completely left
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Austerity is not the best policy in an economic downturn. Austerity has been used numerous times in the UK by successive governments and has only resulted in a demolished and privatised public sector with infrastructure being completely left behind. The only way to solve it is to give tax relief to the companies to pay more to their employees and like this the employee will have more money to spend and pays more tax. However, austerity can lead to periods of lower economic growth and higher unemployment. The cuts to social care spending also mean that the people who rely on it have no resources, which in some cases can lead to a higher death rate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Austerity measures can be a short-term policy to help deal with the initial impact of an economic downturn, however they should be followed by policies that lead to increased government spending, so that the economy can recover. It is important to ensure that the spending is done in a way that does not lead to long-term debt that will further increase the economic problems in the future.
