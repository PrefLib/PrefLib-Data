# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “The group would like to start by acknowledging that climate change is one of the biggest problems the world faces and we need to do all we can to combat it.  We are in agreement that businesses are not doing enough and should be doing more.  However, we do not feel that the answer to this is a carbon tax as businesses will then pass the cost onto the consumer, therefore we feel that rather than introducing a tax the government should offer incentives to businesses to encourage them to become more environmentally friendly.  We are of the opinion that if the government were to offer such incentives then businesses would invest in green initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint.  We all agreed that there would need to be some kind of regulation to ensure that businesses are doing what they say they are doing and that incentives should be tiered based on the size of business and how much energy they use.” The above case study is an example of how a group of people can reach a consensus.  It is also an example of how people can reach a consensus after being informed by the knowledge that all participants share.  In this case, it was a shared belief that climate change is one of the biggest problems the world faces and that businesses should be doing more to
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should enforce a carbon tax on businesses. The biggest threat to the planet is climate change and something needs to be done. Companies need to be encouraged to be sustainable and to move away from the business practices that emit huge amounts of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. By enforcing a carbon tax on businesses it is hoped that this will force companies to start looking at greener alternatives and make the public aware of the crisis that the planet is facing. This will encourage people to come up with solutions and work to save the planet from climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Businesses should pay a carbon tax for polluting the environment. The government should impose a carbon tax on businesses to discourage wasteful consumption of energy and to encourage them to invest in energy-efficient technologies and processes. This would help the environment and prevent businesses from polluting the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group agrees that the government should enforce a carbon tax on businesses. This is to reduce the amount of carbon emissions being released into the atmosphere and will ultimately lead to a better and healthier world. The carbon tax would need to be implemented in a phased manner over time and also dependent upon the size of the business as well as other factors.
