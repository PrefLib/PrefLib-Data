# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be term limits for MPs, possibly of a maximum of 10 years in office.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that there should be a limit on the time a politician can serve as an MP. This is to ensure that the UK is represented by a diverse set of politicians, as well as limiting the influence that large donors and corporations may have on an MP. Also, this will encourage people from different backgrounds and ethnicities to become politicians. In addition, it will provide an opportunity for a greater number of people to become MPs. The current system is out of touch with modern Britain.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of term limits for MPs. This is because it can help to prevent corruption and can help to ensure that the views of the people are being represented. It can also help to ensure that MPs are working hard for their constituents and not just becoming career politicians. However, the group also recognised that in some cases it can be beneficial to have MPs who have served for a long time and have built up expertise in their area. The group felt that there should be a limit of around 10 years for MPs to serve in office and that there should be an upper age limit of around 65 years old.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be term limits for MPs. This is because they can become out of touch with the people they represent. Also, they can be vulnerable to corruption and therefore term limits can help to avoid this. The term limit should be set at 2 years.
