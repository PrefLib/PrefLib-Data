# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of banning single use plastic bottles, but with some caveats. First, it is important to note that banning single use plastic bottles will not solve all the environmental problems, and that we need to continue to work on other solutions to reduce the amount of plastic in our oceans and landfills. Second, we need to ensure that there are sufficient alternatives to single use plastic bottles, such as reusable bottles. Third, we need to ensure that there are sufficient places to refill reusable bottles. Finally, we need to ensure that there are sufficient places to recycle single use plastic bottles, and that we continue to work on reducing the amount of single use plastic bottles in circulation.
