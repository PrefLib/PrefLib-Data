# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the UK should not ban imports of products that are made in countries with a low minimum wage. It is not the UK's place to dictate the minimum wage of other countries. However, it is important to ensure that workers in these countries are not being exploited and are being paid a fair wage. It is important to note that the minimum wage in each country will differ and will be relative to the cost of living in that country. The UK should not support slave labour or poverty wages. It is important to note that the UK can apply pressure to countries paying a very low minimum wage, if it is not in line with living standards.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the UK should not ban imports of products that are made in countries with a low minimum wage. This is because the minimum wage is relative to the economy of the country that it is set in, and therefore our standard of minimum wage is much higher than somewhere such as India or China, where relative costs are lower. It is also important to remember that it is not the fault of the workers in these countries that they are being paid so little, but rather the fault of their governments. However, we should not support slave labour or poverty wages. Therefore, we either need to find an alternative or look at why workers are being paid so badly and how this can be addressed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the UK should not ban imports of products that are made in countries with a low minimum wage. However, we should ensure that the companies we are buying from are treating their workers fairly. This is often difficult to determine, but we should at least look at the policies of the companies we buy from, and not just the country they are in. We should also encourage other countries to increase their minimum wage, as this will help to reduce poverty and increase the standard of living in those countries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should not ban the import of products that are made in countries with a low minimum wage. It is not the UK's place to dictate the minimum wage of other countries. However, it is important to ensure that workers in these countries are not being exploited and are being paid a fair wage. The minimum wage in each country will differ and will be relative to the cost of living in that country. The UK should not support slave labour or poverty wages. It is important to note that there are many factors that impact the cost of living, including the exchange rate. It is vital that the UK remains a trading partner with all other countries. The UK should not support the exploitation of workers.
