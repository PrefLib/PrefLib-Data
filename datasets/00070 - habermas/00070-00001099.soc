# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we should not raise the tax on fuel to encourage people to use less energy.  Tax is already very high and people on low incomes would be hit the hardest by any increase.  Instead, the government should invest in more environmentally friendly forms of energy.  This would encourage people to use more environmentally friendly forms of energy.  The UK already has some of the highest fuel prices in Europe and it is not fair that our prices are higher than elsewhere.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that tax is already too high on fuel and raising the price would only cause unnecessary hardship. The price of petrol and diesel are already high compared to other European countries and raising it would not only be a tax on the people but also an environmental tax since it would encourage people to drive less efficiently.   More research and development needs to be put into cheaper and more efficient forms of transport, this would take the burden away from people who need their cars.  We should put research and development into making wind power and solar power cheaper and more affordable so they can be used to power cars and buildings, this is both a great investment for the environment and for people in need of fuel.  The government should focus on making alternatives to traditional fossil fuels more affordable as the cost is also acting as a barrier. Finally we believe the EU and UK should meet to discuss this issue and create a set of standards for taxation that is more fair to the people and environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group felt that tax is already very high and raising it further would not be beneficial.  They agreed that increasing tax would only harm people and those on low incomes would be hit hardest.  Instead, the government should work on developing more environmentally friendly forms of transport.  This would encourage people to use more environmentally friendly forms of transport.  The group also felt that the UK already has some of the highest fuel prices in Europe and it is not fair that our prices are higher than elsewhere.  The group felt that the government should invest in more environmentally friendly energy alternatives like wind farms and solar so that lower priced energy can be provided to encourage people away from gas, coal and oil.  This is the most beneficial way to encourage people to use less fuel.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group felt that tax is already very high and raising it further would not be beneficial.  Instead of tax, the government should work on creating more environmentally friendly forms of transport, so that more people can use these to transport themselves.  The group also felt that the UK already has some of the highest fuel prices in Europe and it is not fair that our prices are higher than elsewhere.  If other governments are not doing their part in reducing fossil fuels and their prices, then the UK should not force their citizens to pay for it.
