# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a referendum on Scottish independence. The result of a referendum, however will need to be  carefully considered before any action is taken. The general population should be considered and give the chance to vote, however any final decision should be made by politicians and experts, taking into consideration important matters such as economic stability and immigration.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We agree that there should be a referendum on Scottish independence if there is strong support from the Scottish people. However, we believe that the decision should not be made solely by the Scottish people. The question of independence has implications for other parts of the UK and for the EU. A decision made by one section of the UK would affect the whole country. Therefore we believe that a decision made on independence must be agreed upon by a majority of the UK population, including the Scottish people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a referendum on Scottish independence. However, a referendum alone is not sufficient to settle this matter. A referendum can never be as representative of the whole population as we would hope. A referendum should be used to determine the general view of the Scottish people, and also to raise the profile of the issue. After a referendum, there should be a careful consideration of the issue, taking into account both sides of the debate, before a final decision is made. This decision should not be taken by politicians alone, but should also involve experts from many areas, including business, the economy, immigration and others.  This decision should not only consider the Scottish people, but also the rest of the UK. A Scottish referendum must not be taken in isolation, but must be considered within the context of the whole of the UK, in addition to the European Union. The consensus opinion is that there should be a Scottish referendum, but that it should not be used to come to a final decision.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of a referendum on Scottish independence. The participants believed that the Scottish people should be given the opportunity to vote on the issue and that the result of the referendum should be respected. The group believed that the referendum result should be considered carefully before any action is taken. The group also believed that the referendum result should be considered in the context of the UK as a whole and that the referendum should not be considered in isolation. The group believed that the referendum result should be considered in the context of the UK as a whole and that the referendum should not be considered in isolation.
