# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It should be a legal requirement for businesses to provide private space for breastfeeding mothers where possible and practical to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Businesses should be obliged to provide private space for breastfeeding mothers, but this should be considered on a case by case basis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Businesses should be obliged to provide private space for breastfeeding mothers. While we understand that it may not always be practical for small businesses to do so, we feel that it is important to provide a space for breastfeeding mothers. We believe that it is the responsibility of businesses to make mothers feel comfortable and welcome, and providing a space for breastfeeding mothers to feed their children is an important part of this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We think businesses should be obliged to provide a private space for breastfeeding mothers. This is a matter of basic decency and most employers would want to do this anyway as they should be looking to create an environment where all staff feel comfortable. While it may not always be practical, e.g. a one man band driving instructor, in the majority of cases it should be possible to create a suitable space, e.g. a break room. The mother should have the option to choose if they want to use the space and it should be a place where the mother can feel safe and confident.
