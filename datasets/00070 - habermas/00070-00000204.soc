# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the price of the same product should be the same in all supermarkets. However, where a supermarket is able to prove that its business operations (e.g. transportation of products) mean that it incurs higher costs than other supermarkets, they should be allowed to charge higher prices.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a set RRP for each product. Supermarkets should be allowed to have one item on promotion at any one time.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, supermarkets should not be legally required to charge the same price for the same product, unless they are branded. This is because supermarkets are businesses and will lose money if they have to lower their prices, especially as they may need to increase them later to compensate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - All supermarkets should be legally obliged to charge the same price for the same product, as long as all the ingredients and manufacturing process is the same. They should be allowed to offer deals on certain products to incentivise sales, but this should not apply to own brand foods.
