# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, children should be made to go to school, however in special circumstances it should be allowed to home school. This would be particularly important if it was not practical to send them to school for example if the family were very isolated or if they had specific needs. Children should not be denied a proper education but should be given the chance to receive it in a way which is suitable for their particular circumstances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Children should be obliged to attend school, as it provides them with a good education and a chance to socialise. In the rare circumstances where a child cannot be sent to school due to disability or illness, the parents should be expected to provide the child with a suitable alternative.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: School is important for children’s development socially and for education. Parents need to be accountable for their children, therefore they should be obliged to send their children to school. It is detrimental to children if they are not given an education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In principle parents should be required to send their children to school. School provides a child with a standardised education and allows them to interact with other children. However, it is unfair to force parents to send their children to school if they have the means to provide an equivalent level of education at home.
