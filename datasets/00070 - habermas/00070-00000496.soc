# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should have a universal basic income, as it will provide everyone with an income which is guaranteed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: A Universal Basic Income would be a good idea if it was affordable. It would help to reduce inequality, and help to bridge the gap between the richest and poorest.  It should be tax-funded, with a small amount paid in income tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Income is something that people need for basic living costs, such as food, clothing and shelter.  The fact that many people are still living in poverty in the UK is evidence that there is a problem with the way the welfare system is currently working.  We believe that a Universal Basic Income would provide a minimum income for people in the UK, ensuring that people have enough money to pay for their basic needs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: A universal basic income would be a very welcome initiative for the country, however we do not think it is realistic to think it would happen.  There would be too many issues to address such as how to administer it, how to set the level, who would be eligible, how to pay for it.  There are too many questions that cannot be answered right now and it would require a lot more research and input to address the questions and see what would be the best way to approach this.  This is an important topic that deserves a lot of attention, and we would love to see this be a reality, however it will take a long time to achieve.
