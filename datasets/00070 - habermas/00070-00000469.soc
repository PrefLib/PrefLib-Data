# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Scotland should not leave the UK. The nation has been a key part of the UK for hundreds of years. It would be detrimental to both Scotland and the UK as a whole. This opinion was reached because of the following reasons: It is not economically feasible to support Scotland. The UK has supported Scotland in the past but can no longer do so.  Scotland also supports the UK, so the UK would not be able to fully support Scotland.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Scotland should not leave the UK. The nation has been a key part of the UK for hundreds of years. It would be detrimental to both Scotland and the UK as a whole. The process of reaching a consensus is hard, but very important. The whole group of people in the discussion must agree with the final consensus statement in order for it to be accepted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Scotland should remain part of the UK. It would be detrimental to both Scotland and the UK as a whole to split the two nations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Scotland should not leave the UK. The nation has been a key part of the UK for hundreds of years. It would be detrimental to both Scotland and the UK as a whole. It is not economically feasible to support Scotland. The UK has supported Scotland in the past but can no longer do so.  Scotland also supports the UK, so the UK would not be able to fully support Scotland. (To be continued) The views expressed in this article are solely my views and not those of anyone else.
