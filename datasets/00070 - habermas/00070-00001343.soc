# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that we should allow the use of medical marijuana for certain illnesses. The main argument for this is the amount of anecdotal evidence that exists that medical marijuana helps people with various complaints. This is further supported by studies that suggest that marijuana could be useful for people with chronic pain and even people with epilepsy. Whilst marijuana is not a wonder drug that will cure people of various complaints, it does appear to have some positive effect and there are studies that suggest that the benefits outweigh the side effects. As with any medicine, a careful risk/benefit assessment must be carried out for each patient and, if it is decided that the benefits of marijuana outweigh the risks, it should be made available. It is important to note that marijuana is not without side effects and those using it must be aware of the potential harms.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing the use of medical marijuana for certain illnesses. It was noted that this would need to be prescribed by a medical professional and that the use of medical marijuana would need to be closely monitored. The use of medical marijuana is not a new concept and it is something that is used in other countries. It was noted that there is a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that it can help people with a variety of illnesses. It was also noted that there are some illnesses where it is not yet known whether it can help and this is something that needs to be looked into further. The group was also in favour of legalising marijuana for recreational use as it is significantly less harmful than other legal drugs such as alcohol and cigarettes. It was noted that this would destroy the black market and ensure that money is no longer going to criminals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the use of medical marijuana for certain illnesses. The group felt that it was important to distinguish between medical marijuana and recreational marijuana use. The group felt that medical marijuana should only be prescribed by a medical professional and that it should be tightly controlled. The group felt that the use of medical marijuana could be beneficial for people suffering from certain illnesses and that it could be an effective pain relief for some people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although marijuana is a controlled drug in most countries, it has recently been proven that medical marijuana has been helping many people, so in this case it should be allowed as it has a good impact on peoples health. In many cases, marijuana is a better and safer alternative to prescribed drugs and has a lower addiction rate.
