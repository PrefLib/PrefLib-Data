# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the government is not doing enough to protect us from climate change. They have put some policies in place, but these have not been followed through with enough vigour and are not leading to sufficient reductions in emissions. It is a case of the government putting in place a lot of good policies, but not really implementing them properly. This has been seen with the way the government has approached recycling. While they have put a lot of policies in place that have lead to significant increases in recycling, it is clear that the public is willing to recycle more, and these increases have not come from the government's policies. Additionally, I think that the government could be doing more to incentivise the use of green energy and energy efficiency measures.  While the UK has taken a step in the right direction, the government has to put in place a lot more policies that will actually be implemented and that will lead to reductions in emissions if we are to meet the government's carbon neutral target for 2050.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the government isn't doing enough to tackle climate change. Although it is one of the better countries in the world, it still has a lot of room for improvement. The opinion for this group of participants went from 3 votes of No to 2 votes of Yes, to 2 votes of No and 2 votes of I'm not sure, to a final consensus of No.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We don't believe that the government is doing enough to protect us against climate change. While the government has made lofty promises to be carbon neutral by 2050, and have no petrol cars for sale by 2030, they have not put in place policies to back this up. The government is too focused on the economy and other matters and is not doing enough to prepare the UK for the realities of climate change - as seen by their recent granting approval for a new coal mine in the UK - at a significant cost to the tax payer that will cause massive green house gas emissions. We need massive policy change that this government is either unwilling or unable to bring about.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government is not doing enough to protect us from climate change. We have the targets to reduce greenhouse gases and the use of fossil fuels but this will take many decades. The government should set deadlines for targets to be reached to ensure that we move towards a low carbon economy and start to protect us from the effects of climate change. We also need to address the causes of climate change in other countries. If other countries are not doing their bit then the UK will be making a massive sacrifice if we reduce our emissions when other countries are not doing the same.
