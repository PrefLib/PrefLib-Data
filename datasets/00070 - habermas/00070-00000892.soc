# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of celebrating the life of Sir Winston Churchill, but there were some caveats. The group agreed that his racist views and his support of using poisonous gas should not be celebrated. They also agreed that his role in the Gallipoli Campaign was not something to be celebrated, as this was a major military failure. They felt that the main reason to celebrate the life of Sir Winston Churchill was his role in the Second World War, as it was felt that he was a very important leader during this time and that he was very brave in the face of adversity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of celebrating Churchill's life.  The group recognised that he made some mistakes, but also that he was instrumental in winning the Second World War and therefore should be celebrated.  However, the group also recognised that he held racist views and that this should be acknowledged.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should celebrate the life of Sir Winston Churchill.  It is a commonly held belief that he is the best Prime Minister we have ever had and I believe having him as Prime Minister during the war years certainly helped us win the War.  I know he was held responsible for some mistakes made during the First World War, I believe, but at least he did make decisions.  We should celebrate Winston Churchill based upon his accomplishments, taking us as a country through WWII. I do not believe the racist connotations should be admired though as this does not reflect society in today's image. We also believe that we should celebrate the life of Sir Winston Churchill.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of celebrating the life of Sir Winston Churchill. The group was of the opinion that the good he had done for the country far outweighed any bad. The group felt that the bad things he had done should not be forgotten, but that it should be remembered that he was a product of his time. The group also felt that it was important to remember that he was human and therefore had flaws.
