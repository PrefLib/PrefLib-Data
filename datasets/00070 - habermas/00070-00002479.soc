# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We agree that the government should introduce a higher minimum wage for workers under 18. The current situation is that there is a cost of living crisis and the government has a responsibility to ensure that people do not fall below the floor in their living conditions. A job is the best way to help people, but a job with a minimum wage and conditions is what people should expect in a civilised society. We believe that everybody deserves fair pay. As inflation is still exceptionally high we believe that the minimum wage for under eights should be increased in line with this. People of this age however probably do not have the same expenses as people who are older than this and we suspect still really on support from their parents but even so should be rewarded for their work and encouraged to progress in life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should introduce higher minimum wages for workers under 18 in order to provide them with fair pay for the work they do. The current situation is unfair and does not reflect the reality of the work that these people do. The increase should be in line with inflation and should reflect the cost of living. The current government is right to say that a job is the best way to help people and the increase in minimum wage will help people to get a job and will also help them to keep a job. The consensus opinion of the group was reached through discussion and an examination of the opinions of each individual. It was clear that the group was in favour of the increase but it was important to ensure that the increase was in line with inflation and also reflected the cost of living. It was also important to the group that the increase was fair and reflected the work that was being done.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should introduce a higher minimum wage for workers under 18. The current minimum wage for those under 18 is £3.68 per hour. This is significantly lower than the minimum wage for those over 18 (£6.31 per hour). With the current cost of living crisis, it is unfair that younger people are being paid less for doing the same job as someone over 18. The current minimum wage for those under 18 is not enough to live on and so should be increased. The minimum wage for those under 18 should be increased to £6.31 per hour. This would be a fairer minimum wage and would help younger people to live independently and get on in life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should introduce higher minimum wages for workers under 18. In a civilised society, people should expect a job with a minimum wage and conditions. It is not fair if those under 18 do the same job as someone over 18 but get paid less. People of this age probably do not have the same expenses as people who are older than this but should be rewarded for their work and encouraged to progress in life. With the current situation and the cost of living crisis, the minimum wage for workers under 18 should be increased to help them with increasing costs.
