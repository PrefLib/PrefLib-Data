# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the government should not have the right to limit the size of peoples houses.  However, if a person is living in social housing then it is reasonable for the government to ask them to downsize if they have many unused bedrooms, for example once their children all leave home.  The government should not have the right to limit the size of new houses that are built, however if a person wants to build a house that is too big for the space or the area then they should be able to intervene.  If the size of the house is a threat to nature or the environment then maybe local councils can limit this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should not have the right to limit the size of people's houses, as this is an individual matter.  There should be no limit on the size of houses if they are entirely self-funded.  However, for people in social housing, if they are living in a house that is bigger than their family needs, then they should be required to downsize so that their home can be re-allocated to a larger family in need of housing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should have the right to limit the size of people's houses only if people are reliant on council housing, in which case a house should be allocated that is suitable for the size of the family.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should not have the right to limit the size of peoples houses, however, the government should have the right to limit the size of peoples houses if they are reliant on government housing or if the house is a threat to the environment.
