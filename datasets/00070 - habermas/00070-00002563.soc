# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: yes. it would remove the stigma of so called benefit scroungers if everyone had the same income. so many people have to worry about money which can have physical and mental effects. if this source of worry and anxiety was removed, people could live happier and more productive lives.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, I believe tax credit is a good method as it takes the pressure off everyone in the end. When it come on to tax it is very stressful and to leave that up to every individual will cause more good than bad. At the end of the day tax is the reason why we have "free" health care and women don't have to pay money when they give birth like in the US.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Hard to answer as I have little knowledge about tax credits. But in my opinion, the system as it is at the moment does not work for some people. This includes people with non-physical disabilities such as mental health conditions or Autism, where it is hard to prove you are unable to work and need financial support from the government to survive. As a result, the concept of a Universal Basic Income is interesting to me.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I do not think so. We need to assess their financial situation and whether they are able to work and then distribute money according to their need. People can become lazy if we do not assess their ability to work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I don't know very much about this topic, so I have more questions than views. Are these two baically the same? Would a person be better off or worse off if the change was made? What is the reason for a change to be made? If a person wouldn't be penalised by the change, and the system was better for the change, then i can't see any reason why not.
