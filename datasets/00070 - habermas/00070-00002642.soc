# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Of course. I believe this world is better when we are as one. I dont agree with countries penalising and restricting others on trade. We are all human and I dont think a lot of countries care about the humans in the countries they are putting restrictions on. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: i dont really know enough about globalization to give an answer on this either way
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I believe it has, to case a point from the last question, vaccine for COVID was tackled globally and rolled out. it helps connect human's which can only help us understand each others differences and struggles and of course strength's. Which will be the source of a better future for all mankind 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I think that globalization potentially brings countries together, which I think is very important. We should see the world united as a whole rather than having an 'us' and 'them' mentality. We should have a greater understanding of other cultures and work together to achieve a planet where everyone gets on. However, the word is usually used in terms of big businesses dominating the market, which I don't particularly agree with. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I think that overall it has. Globalisation has meant that everyone now has access to new cultures and markets. This has meant that goods are accessed at a better cost, and people have a higher standard of living.
