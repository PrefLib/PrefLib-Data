# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of a monarchy, with a few dissenters. The majority of the group felt that the UK is better off with a monarchy than with a president. This is because the UK has a long history of monarchy and it would be a shame to lose this tradition. A monarchy is a symbol of national pride and unity, whereas a president would be just another politician. However, the group did agree that the monarchy should be reformed, and that the royal family should not receive so much money from the taxpayer. The group felt that the royal family should be more open and transparent about their activities. The group also felt that the royal family should be more involved in charitable activities and in promoting the UK abroad. The group felt that a balance needs to be struck between monarch and government. Monarchs should not be involved in the running of the country, but they should not be barred from having their own political views. In this way, the UK would be better off if it had a monarchy rather than a president.

The group felt that this would remove some of the power from the royal family, and would allow the monarchy to become more democratic.
