# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The safety of the public is paramount. For this reason, we agree that wearing a helmet while cycling should be mandatory as it reduces the risk of head injury and in the long term reduces the impact on the NHS. As with wearing a seatbelt in a car, it is a small price to pay for a big protection. The evidence for this is overwhelming, and we believe that this is the best way to protect the public and to reduce the amount of head injuries that occur as a result of cycling accidents.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There is overwhelming evidence that wearing a helmet while cycling can protect the cyclist's head and reduce the risk of head injury. For this reason, we believe that wearing a helmet should be mandatory and enforced, so that all cyclists are afforded this level of protection and also so that the NHS does not have to spend huge amounts of resources treating cyclists with head injuries. A good analogy is to compare it with wearing a seatbelt when driving. While wearing a seatbelt may not reduce the number of car accidents, it can significantly reduce the injuries sustained by the driver and passenger in an accident.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the safety of the public is paramount. For this reason, we agree that wearing a helmet while cycling should be mandatory as it reduces the risk of head injury and in the long term reduces the impact on the NHS. As with wearing a seatbelt in a car, it is a small price to pay for a big protection. The evidence for this is overwhelming, and we believe that this is the best way to protect the public and to reduce the amount of head injuries that occur as a result of cycling accidents.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Wearing a helmet while cycling is the best way to protect cyclists from head injuries and should be mandatory. The evidence is overwhelming and is supported by many different studies. It is only a small price to pay to stay safe and we believe that this would improve the safety of cyclists and make cycling a more accessible option for the public.
