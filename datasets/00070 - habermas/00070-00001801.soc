# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of a basic income, but felt that it should be means tested, and that it should be funded by taxing higher earners more.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “No, we should not give everyone a basic income and stop benefits / tax credits. If we did this, those who do not need money (wealthy to middle class) would be receiving unnecessary funds which could go to those who need it. This would also reduce the incentive to go to work, if everyone simply receives a basic income without having to claim specific benefits such as job seekers allowance, and potentially restrict economic growth. Unless funding magically appears, providing everyone with basic income would mean restricting funds in another area, such as education / healthcare. A fairer way would maybe tax the higher earners and then give a basic income to the poorest. It would still need to be means tested to make it fair as everyones income and circumstances are different. so it should be means tested depending on dependants and outgoings debts etc.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should provide everyone with a basic income so that everyone can have a fair start in life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Consensus View: In the ideal world we would give everyone a basic income and stop all benefits and tax credits. However, at the moment this is just not realistic. We do not have the money to fund such a project and to actually give everyone a basic income. We do however, think that the benefits system needs a complete overhaul to make it simpler and fairer. This means reducing the benefits that are offered and also taking a more sensible approach to what people claim. For example, people can claim benefits even if they have millions in the bank. This does not make any sense. We also think that people should have to be more actively looking for work, instead of simply staying at home and claiming benefits.
