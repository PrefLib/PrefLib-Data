# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Advertising to children should be limited to protect them from the manipulative nature of advertising. This would be beneficial to society as a whole as it would prevent companies from manipulating children into liking their products, therefore allowing them to make their own choices. The issue with advertising to children is that it is incredibly difficult to find a balance between the right amount of advertising and the wrong amount. Advertising is a necessary evil in a capitalist society, however it is important to find a balance that prevents children from being manipulated and protects their innocence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should limit the amount of TV advertising directed at children. Advertising can negatively influence children and they should be allowed to form their own opinions first without pressure from the media. Companies should not strive to make children users of their product as early as possible so they have a customer for life, and it should be limited so they aren't indoctrinated into liking certain companies due to what they've seen advertised on television screens at a young age. A good example of this would be McDonalds, a company that strives to appeal to children so they have adult fans of their company and products when they are adults. Limiting the amount of advertisements that children are exposed to can only be a good thing, and we are in full support of such a change. We cannot see any benefits of advertising to young children and it can only be harmful and mainpulative.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, we believe that we should limit the amount of TV advertising directed at children. This is because children are very vulnerable and easily influenced by what they see and hear. However, we also recognise that children have the right to be exposed to a variety of different products and brands so that they can make informed choices when they are older. Therefore, we would only want to limit advertising that is likely to cause harm to children or that could influence them to make poor decisions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of limiting TV advertising directed at children. The participants believed that it would be beneficial to limit advertising as it could potentially influence children in a negative way and lead to children being exposed to products that are potentially harmful. The group felt that it is unfair to advertise to children as they are vulnerable and easily influenced. However, the group also felt that there are some products that should not be advertised to children. The group felt that advertising gambling, smoking, and alcohol to children could lead to them taking up these habits at a young age and so these products should not be advertised to children.
