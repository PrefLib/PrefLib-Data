# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should continue to invest in the International Space Station. The UK has a long history of space exploration and should continue to be a leader in this field. The discoveries made as a result of the International Space Station will lead to significant scientific advances that will benefit the whole of humanity. The UK should also continue to invest in the International Space Station as it will help to maintain the UK's status as a leader in space exploration and will also help to maintain the UK's status as a leader in the global economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should continue to invest in the International Space Station to continue pushing the boundaries of space exploration. This is something that can benefit all mankind and will ultimately lead to new discoveries and innovations that can be used to help society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should continue to invest in the International Space Station. The UK has a long history of space exploration, and the International Space Station is a key part of this. It is a unique platform for scientific research, and has the potential to be a stepping stone to future missions in the solar system. The UK has the opportunity to be a key player in this, and the benefits of this will be felt for generations to come.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should continue to invest in the International Space Station. This is a long-term commitment and a worthwhile one, as the scientific advances made in the space programme help advance technology that be utilised in the global economy. In addition, new resources that we have never before thought of, or could use, may be found. We also don't know how long we have left on earth, so we should put some effort into exploring space as a new planet for humans to live on.
