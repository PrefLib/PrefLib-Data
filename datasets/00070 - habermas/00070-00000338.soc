# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People should not be fined for littering. We should not be treating each other as criminals for what is a pretty normal act. The government and councils should provide more bins and get rid of litter if it already there. Putting people in prison and making them pay money does not address the root cause of the problem, which is lack of bins. What do you think?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, people should be fined for littering in public spaces. The way we dispose of our rubbish can have a big impact on our environment and our community. It is only right that we all play our part in keeping the places we live in clean and safe. Littering is a widespread problem and everyone has a responsibility to help tackle it. Littering also has a negative impact on the environment, our wildlife and can also cost the tax payer millions of pounds a year. I think that people who are caught littering in public should be fined.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be fines for littering in public places.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People should be fined for littering in public places. It is very easy to pick up your rubbish and bin it. It will be a lot easier for everyone if everyone picked up after themselves. No one wants to live in a dirty world. If the fine is severe enough, it will change the way people act.
