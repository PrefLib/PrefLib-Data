# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the idea of companies donating to charities is a great one.  However, as alluded to in our individual opinions, we do not believe that it is realistic or feasible for every company to be forced to donate, without consideration of their financial situation and profit margins.  The issue is not so black and white, and it would be detrimental to a number of companies if such a decree were made, especially to smaller companies and those which are not as financially viable.  However, we do believe that larger, more financially stable companies should be encouraged to donate a portion of their profits to charities.  However, it must still be a choice, as every company is different.  In addition, the charities which would be supported should be varied, as they all have different and unique circumstances, and all need support.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we do not think that all companies in the UK should be required to make a yearly donation to charity. The group felt that the statement was too broad and did not take into account the different sizes of companies and their different levels of profitability. The group felt that it would be unfair to force companies to make donations to charity if they were not in a position to do so. The group felt that it would be more appropriate to encourage companies to make donations to charity rather than force them to do so.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In principle, this is a great idea.  However, the profits of the company must also be considered.  We don't believe in a decree where "all" must be obligated to make a donation, as not all companies have the same level of profit.  In addition, it is vital to consider the charities involved, and the ethos of the companies.  There can be no "one size fits all" to this proposal, and there are so many variables.  Whilst we think it can be a good idea to encourage support to charities, it cannot be to the detriment of companies, and in addition it must also still have scope for choice.
