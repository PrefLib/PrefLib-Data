# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes. People who aren't absolutely desperate for money are better members of society! £100 isn't enough to mean that people would suddenly quit working, but it could be the difference between eating and not eating or heating the house and shivering in the cold for some people. Of course you'll get people who will abuse it but on the whole I think everyone could do with a little help at the moment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I am not firmly against the idea of basic income guarantees in principle, but I cannot see a situation whereby anyone would fail to already get at least £100 a month from either wages or benefits (or interest on savings or pensions etc.).    My view is that we should not use this to give everyone £100 a month because there is no indication that it would be means tested and even if it was means tested, the cost of checking eligibiliy might be more than the money being given out. I don't think that this is a viable proposition so my view is that we should not use a basic income guarantee system.   Arguably we already provide a basic income guarantee of more than £100 a month to those in hardship via the benefits system. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No! If everyone was to receive this money not only would this be a huge burden on the country but people who do not need it would be receiving it. It wouldn't in anyway create an even playing field for everyone and would just push the problem of inequality and cost of living crisis even further. . 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: While I think the idea of a Basic Income Guarantee system is an interesting one that has its merits I think £100 a month is far too low to have any real effect on people's lives.  £1000 would be more realistic although the costs of such a scheme would have to be examined closely.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: No, £100 for someone who earns £100K+ is neither here nor there. Give the money to people who need it most.
