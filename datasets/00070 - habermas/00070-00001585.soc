# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No we shouldn't increase the rate of VAT.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should not increase the rate of VAT. We believe that the current financial climate is affecting too many people to increase the rate of VAT. People are struggling to afford to pay their rent, their mortgages, their energy bills and their food bills. VAT is one of the things that everyone pays and it will make life even more difficult for those who are already struggling. Increasing VAT would impact those who are earning less the most. Whilst they may be paying less tax, they will pay more VAT and that is not fair. We believe that increasing VAT would have a negative impact on everyone in society and therefore, we believe that VAT should not be increased.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we should not increase the rate of VAT. In these uncertain times, it would be a terrible time to increase the rate of VAT. It would only increase the financial struggles that many people are already facing. There are other ways that the government can increase their revenue, without increasing the VAT. The current rate of 20% is already a significant increase on the cost of the things that people need. In the current cost of living crisis, people are struggling to pay their mortgages, rent, energy bills and food bills. VAT increases are a blunt tool that would affect all members of society including those already at breaking point financially.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, VAT should not be increased. The current cost of living crisis means that people are struggling to pay their mortgages, rent, energy bills and food bills. VAT increases are a blunt tool that would affect all members of society including those already at breaking point financially.
