# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In principle, the police should be allowed to stop and search people for drugs if they are in an area known for drug dealing. However, this should be subject to the following conditions: - There must be a reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in drug dealing. - The police must have sufficient information to justify this suspicion. - The police must have a clear policy on the use of stop and search powers and this must be subject to independent review.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is possible for police to use their powers to stop and search for drugs in a way that is acceptable and in the best interests of all citizens, however they must not do so simply on the basis of where a person is or the ethnicity of a person. They must do so on the basis of behavioural observations of an individual or individuals that arouse suspicion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We agree that the police should be allowed to stop and search people for drugs if they are in an area known for drug dealing. However, this should only be done if there is reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in drug dealing.
