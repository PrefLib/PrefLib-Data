# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government is failing to tackle child obesity. The long-term consequences of this include a greater burden on the health services and reduced future earning potential. There are a number of simple steps the government can take to start tackling the issue. Firstly, they need to make school meals healthy and compulsory. This would ensure that children at least get one healthy meal a day. Secondly, the government needs to find a way to subsidise healthy foods and make it easier for parents to provide healthy meals at home. Finally, the government needs to invest in programmes that educate kids about healthy eating and physical exercise, and make this part of the school curriculum.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government is failing to tackle child obesity. The nation has a problem with obesity, and the government is doing little to solve it. It needs to take simple measures like encouraging kids to eat healthy meals at school and at home. It needs to provide better nutrition education to kids so that they can make healthy choices.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government is failing to tackle child obesity. They need to stop looking at ways to increase revenue and start looking at the future of the nation. There are simple steps the government can take to start tackling the issue. Firstly, it needs to make school meals healthy and compulsory. This would ensure that children at least get one healthy meal a day. Secondly, it needs to find a way to subsidise healthy foods and make it easier for parents to provide healthy meals at home. Finally, the government needs to invest in programmes that educate kids about healthy eating and physical exercise, and make this part of the school curriculum.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government is failing to tackle child obesity. The government should not be focusing on the revenue from taxes on unhealthy foods, but on the health of the nation and the long term financial and social impact of obesity. It needs to take into account the opinions of experts like Jamie Oliver and Henry Dimbleby who are trying to tackle this issue. They should make school meals healthy and compulsory, but subsidise healthy foods to make it easier for parents to provide healthy meals at home. They need to encourage exercise and make nutrition and cookery part of the school curriculum.
