# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: For any family, raising children is expensive. These families are raising the next generation of people to live in the UK. Providing tax breaks helps them lessen the burden of the cost of raising children, especially during this cost of living crisis. There are concerns of how many children and families live in poverty, and such tax breaks will help lessen this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I think it is important that families with children are able to afford to live a healthy lifestyle and there are costs associated with children that families without children won't experience (e.g., buying new clothes as children grow). However, I don't know if applying a blanket tax break for families with children is appropriate because some families with children will be far better-off financially than families without children. I think it would be better to give means-tested tac breaks to families with children. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I believe that we should give extra tax breaks to families with children to help them get by. This is because there is an ongoing cost of living crisis where many households across the country are struggling to afford to pay their bills. I also believe that there should be more incentives for people with children because it is difficult for people to start a family because of the cost, which leads to a declining population with lots of old residents and fewer younger people to work to look after them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I don't think we should give extra tax breaks to families with children. The reason is this category does not differentiate between those who need help and those who don't. You can have four children and be extremely wealthy. Or have no children and struggling to survive. Tax breaks need to evaluate a far wider range of criteria than just whether an individual has children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Yes I believe we should. With high inflation and a cost of living crisis, supporting families seems to be a good option. Tax breaks would enable extra income to be freed up for those families with children, and would be a simple government policy to instigate.
