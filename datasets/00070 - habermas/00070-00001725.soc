# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should be doing more to help young people who are struggling to buy a house.  House prices are rising and the average wage is not.  This makes it very difficult to save for a deposit, and the help to buy ISAs are not enough.  The government should also be doing more to help with the cost of renting.  Rental prices are rising and landlords are buying up houses and renting them out, making it harder for young people to find a place to live.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should be doing more to help young people who are struggling to buy a house.  One of the main problems that have been discussed is that the price of houses is too high in comparison to the income of most young people.  It has been debated that there are ways that the government can help in this instance.  It was suggested that a tax could be introduced on second homes or buy to let homes so that the first time buyer has a better chance.  In this day and age a lot of young people are forced to live with their parents for longer and it has been suggested that this tax could also be introduced if children are forced to live with their parents after the age of 24.  In addition to this, it was suggested that the help to buy scheme that is currently in place could be improved so that it is more accessible to more people and not just first time buyers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should be doing more to help young people struggling to buy a house.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should be doing more to help young people struggling to buy a house.  This is because the cost of houses is rising and the cost of living is also rising.  The government should be doing more to help young people because they will be the future generation who will be running the country.
