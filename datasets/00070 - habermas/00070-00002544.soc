# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I suppose it would depend on the size and potential obstruction that the power station would cause. Having huge cooling towers in EVERY town would obviously be ridiculous but I definitely agree that nuclear power should be utilised more. If there were to be more nuclear power stations, they should be handled in a highly scrutinised manner so as to avoid disaster or accidents, as when handled correctly, nuclear power plants are very safe, reliable, and efficient methods of providing power.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, I don't think we should build a nuclear power station in every town. Building a nuclear power station in every town will take a massive amount of effort, resources, land and time up. Town residents will most likely voice their displeasure at a nuclear power station being built in their town. People will be worried about the effect it will have on their town, the environment, their future, and if a nuclear disaster were to strike. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Whilst nuclear power is a great thing that we should definitely expand, to stop depending on fossil fuels and imported power, not only would building a nuclear power station in every town cost a huge amount of money that no one has right now, it would also ruin the natural landscape. Many towns retain a certain architecture, culture, and sense of nature, and a huge nuclear power plant in the skyline would ruin that. Additionally, many towns probably don't have the space for it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I do not think that we should build a nuclear power station in every town. This is because this would have a catastrophic health and environmental impact on the country. Nuclear power creates radioactive waste. If this is to get into the air, it can cause severe sickness for humans. This would also have an impact on the environment. Having a nuclear power station in every town would only increase the risk of a disaster taking place. There are many other safer ways to generate energy for the country, which should be considered first. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: No, I don't! As much as we need nuclear power to work alongside the others (wind, tidal etc), we should try to use these others before the nuclear. The waste is a big threat to our planet and life.
