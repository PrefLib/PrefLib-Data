# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, it is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. In general, the prices of products should be the same for all customers. This is to ensure that all customers are treated equally and fairly. It is also to ensure that all customers have access to the same products, and that no customer is left out or disadvantaged due to their age or sex. It is also important to note that in some cases, it may be acceptable to offer discounts to certain groups of people. For example, it may be acceptable to offer discounts to students, pensioners, or NHS workers. However, these discounts should be available to all people who fall into these categories, and should not be available to some and not others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. In a world where we are striving for equality, it would be unfair to charge different prices for the same product to different demographics. If a company is looking to increase their profits, they should do this by increasing the price for everyone, or by reducing the price for everyone. It is not morally acceptable to single out a specific demographic and charge them more for the same product. If a company is looking to offer a discount to a specific demographic, they should offer this discount to everyone. If a company is looking to increase their profits by charging a specific demographic more for the same product, this is a form of discrimination and is not morally acceptable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. In order to ensure equality across the board, prices should be the same for everyone. There may be exceptions for discounts for certain demographics, but these should be available to all. It is not fair to increase prices for certain groups just because they may be more likely to purchase a product, and it is also not fair to decrease prices for certain groups just because they may not be able to afford the product. It is important to ensure equality across the board and to make sure that everyone is treated the same. It is also important to make sure that the company is not making a profit just because they can get away with it, and it is also important to make sure that the company is not losing out on profits just because they can get away with it. It is important to make sure that everyone is treated equally and fairly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, it is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. All customers should be treated equally and fairly, and there should be no discrimination on the basis of age or sex. In order to achieve equality, the price should be the same for all customers. It is understandable that prices may be increased or decreased based on demand for the product, but this should be the case for all customers, and not just specific demographics. It would be fair to decrease prices for certain demographics where a product may otherwise be too expensive if it should be easily accessible, but in these cases the prices should also be the same for everyone, otherwise it may lead to some individuals having to go without a product that is necessary just based on a demographic that they cannot do anything about in this instance.
