# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that there should be a tax on sugary drinks as this will discourage people from buying them. In addition to this, the money that is collected will be able to be used in different ways to help with the obesity crisis. For example, this money could be used to subsidise healthier alternatives to sugary drinks, which would make it easier for people to access and help improve their diet. We also believe that it is important to implement a tax on sugary drinks as this will provide an incentive for companies to change their products in a healthier way. This is important as if companies are not using sugar in their products, people will not be purchasing them. This could help to solve the obesity crisis. However, there should be a reasonable limit to the tax as this will allow people to still be able to purchase the drinks, which they enjoy. In addition to this, we believe that the money raised through this tax should be used to subsidise healthy food, such as fruit and vegetables, which will make them more affordable and accessible for people, as currently these foods are seen as luxury items for many people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a tax on sugary drinks. We believe that this is needed as there is a strong correlation between the consumption of sugary drinks and obesity. Obesity is a growing problem in the UK and it is important to combat this problem. The tax will act as a deterrent to consuming sugary drinks and will help to reduce obesity levels. This will lead to a healthier population and will help to reduce the strain on the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that there needs to be a small tax put on sugary drinks. This will discourage people, and particularly children, from consuming sugary drinks as much as they do now. We believe that by making these drinks more expensive, this will also lead to a decline in sales, as people are less likely to buy them. A tax on sugary drinks will also help in generating revenue for the government, that can be used in different areas, and promoting healthier alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the tax on sugary drinks is a good idea. We believe that it is needed to set taxes on sugary drinks. It is being observed that, the problems of obesity is getting bigger and bigger with time. And one of the main reasons for this is to intake sugary drinks. Implementing tax would discourage people specially child to consume less sugary drinks.
