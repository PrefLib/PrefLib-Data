# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, people should be allowed to be self-employed at 16 years old. However, they should be allowed to do so only if they have the right skills, they understand what it means to be self-employed and they have a really good idea and/or business plan that is going to work. It should also be the case that the person who is self-employed should be allowed to continue with his or her education, as this is the best thing for them at this age.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should be allowed to be self-employed at 16 years old if they have a good entrepreneurial idea, and if they have the advice and guidance to be successful.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People should be allowed to be self-employed at 16 years old, but only if they have the right skills, knowledge and support to succeed in their chosen venture.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People should be allowed to be self-employed at 16 years old. The age of 16 is a legal age to work and therefore should be treated equally to other jobs. It is a good idea for people to be self-employed at 16 as it will help them in the future and they will have the skills to be self-employed. The age of 16 is also a good age to be self-employed as it is the age when most people finish school and therefore will have more time to be self-employed.
