# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that the government should raise the minimum wage.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the decision that the government should raise the minimum wage to help those on the lowest incomes to survive. This will also help to increase the living standards for the poorest in our society. We believe that this will also help to reduce the poverty gap and also help to reduce the reliance on welfare benefits. This will also help to reduce the cost to the government and taxpayer of welfare benefits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the government should raise the minimum wage. In these difficult times, it is important that we support the lowest paid in society. We believe that this would help to support families and would help to reduce child poverty. We also believe that the minimum wage should be linked to the cost of living.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that the minimum wage should be raised. We have come to this conclusion because the current minimum wage is not enough to provide for a basic standard of living. The increase in the cost of living has made it very difficult for people to survive on the minimum wage. Therefore, it is essential that the government increase the minimum wage to a level that will provide people with a basic standard of living.
