# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the UK should give independence to the remaining colonies in the Caribbean. This is because the days of the British Empire are long gone and we believe that it is important to let countries be independent if they wish. We also believe that the UK can ill afford to support such colonies. The reasons behind colonies were conquest and exploitation of natural and human resources and we don't think the UK can dress up a reason for hanging on to impede the development of such colonial societies. Where they may struggle as an economic unit alone, then perhaps consensus for mergers/federations as a legal entity under the auspices of the United Nations may help them to prosper when 'freed' from UK dominance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In 2023 the UK should grant independence to all of its remaining Caribbean colonies if they want it.  This is because the UK should not be holding onto colonies in the 21st century, and because it would be unfair to hold back the development of these countries by keeping them in a colonial relationship with the UK.  The UK should also respect the right of the people in these countries to decide their own future, and so should conduct referendums to determine whether they want independence.  The UK should also ensure that any withdrawal from governance is a smooth and democratic process.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should give the Caribbean colonies their independence. The UK has a long and shameful history of slavery and colonialism in the Caribbean, and it is time to move on from this. The UK is not in a position to support these colonies financially, and as such it is not in the UK's best interests to maintain control. The Caribbean colonies should be given the opportunity to vote on whether they wish to remain in the Commonwealth, and if they do wish to remain in the Commonwealth then they should be allowed to do so. If they wish to leave the Commonwealth then they should be allowed to do so. The UK should ensure that the transition to independence is a smooth and democratic process.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should give the remaining colonies in the Caribbean their independence. The days of the British Empire are well and truly over, and the UK has a duty to ensure that all the people of the world have the freedom to live in the way that they want to. The UK has a responsibility to ensure that any withdrawal from governance is a smooth and democratic process, and that any communities with historic ties to both the Caribbean and the UK are considered. The UK should respect the wishes of the people of the Caribbean, and if a referendum results in a majority vote for independence, then the UK should act accordingly.
