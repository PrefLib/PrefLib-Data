# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Pollution, climate change and resource depletion are well documented consequences of human activity, including human consumption of food.  The “Western” diet currently relies heavily on animal products and is detrimental to human health, animal welfare and the environment.  The United Nations warns that global livestock farming is a major threat to the Earth's climate.  Changing the diet of the UK population to one that is less reliant on animal products would significantly reduce the negative impacts of our diet.  This is an important point for policymakers to consider.  The group believes that we should encourage the population to reduce their meat intake, particularly that which has been obtained through factory farming.  Encouraging people to buy animal products such as meat, milk and eggs that are welfare friendly may also help to improve the situation.  Encouraging people to buy locally sourced products is also an important consideration.  Reducing food waste is another important consideration for policymakers to consider.  Reducing food waste is also an important consideration for individual consumers.  The group of participants believe that this is also an important point for policymakers to consider.
