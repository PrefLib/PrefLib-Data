# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should introduce a law that says all adults must vote in all elections. Voting is one of the most basic democratic rights we have and we should not be forcing people to vote. We should introduce the law so that those who don't care to vote are encouraged to vote. Even if they don't vote for the right candidate, it still allows them to have a say in what happens in our society. If everyone who has the right to vote chooses to do so, the more representative the government will be.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we do not think we should introduce a law that says all adults must vote in all elections.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that a law that requires all adults to vote in all elections is unnecessary and will only create undue stress on people to engage in something they don't feel comfortable doing. However, we do believe it is important to encourage people to vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of encouraging as many people as possible to vote. However, there was no agreement as to whether it should be made a legal requirement to vote. The opinion of one person suggested that the result would be skewed by people voting randomly and this would create a representative government. The opinion of one person suggested that it would create a more representative government. A second opinion was that people should have the choice to abstain from voting if they desire. A third opinion was that it would just put pressure on people to vote and it would be counterproductive. In conclusion, it was decided that this topic was too complex to make a strong conclusion. The group could not come to an agreement as to whether it should be made a legal requirement for people to vote.
