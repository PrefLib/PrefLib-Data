# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Draft final consensus statement: There should be a ban on all advertisements for products that are harmful. This is because such products are often addictive, and can cause serious long-term damage to health. Banning such advertisements would help reduce their use. However, it is important to note that policy decisions in this area involve balancing public health and consideration with individual liberties and commercial interest. Final consensus statement: The group broadly agreed that advertising can be a key influencer of human behaviour. As such, bans on advertising of harmful products are likely to reduce the use of those products and improve public health. However, the group broadly disagreed over the extent to which individual liberties and commercial interests should be balanced with public health, noting that finding optimal solutions requires solutions between governments, public health experts, industry stakeholders, and the wider society to address the multifaceted challenges posed by harmful products and their marketing.

Banning such advertisements would help reduce their use. However, it is important to note that policy decisions in this area involve balancing public health and consideration with individual liberties and commercial interest. This is why we feel that an independent body or health watchdog, reporting to government, should be appointed to provide expert advice on whether products are unhealthy or not. This would ensure that decisions around this are taken solely (or at least more likely) in the interest of the public good.

However, it is important to note that policy decisions in this area involve balancing public health and consideration with individual liberties and commercial interest. Any restrictions on adverts must be implemented without encouraging excessive paternalistic control over the market. We also think that advertising of healthy products should be promoted.
