# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the BBC running the World Service. They felt that the BBC is a trusted and reliable news source, and that the World Service is a valuable tool for the UK in terms of promoting democracy and free speech. They also felt that the BBC is the best organisation to run the World Service, and that the service should be funded by the UK licence fee.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The BBC should continue to run the World Service, but should not use UK TV licence fees to fund it. The World Service is a valuable resource and should continue to be funded by the BBC. However, the World Service is used by people all over the world, and it is unfair that the UK should have to pay for it. The World Service should be funded by the countries that use it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the BBC running the World Service. It was felt that they were a trusted organisation and had been running the service successfully for a long time. It was also felt that the World Service was an important source of unbiased news for the western world. It was also felt that the BBC was in a unique position to provide the World Service, as they were a large, established organisation with a long history of providing unbiased news.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The BBC should continue to run the World Service. The BBC is responsible for providing unbiased news, at least to the western world, and this should continue. The BBC are an established and renowned company and I think they have been running the World Service successfully for decades and there is no reason to change that. I dont think so because it is paid for and funded by the UK. I dont see a problem with them running a world service its just the same as any other tv network doing it but i wouldn't be happy if it was funded by UK tv liecence which i feel is already a needless fee. Before this, I had never even heard of the World Service, so I'm not sure I'm truly in a place to comment. Having had a quick look on Google, it seems to be a worldwide radio station. I guess if it is something people want and are happy with, then yes, they should run it.
