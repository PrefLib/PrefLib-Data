# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not introduce a new public holiday to commemorate the UK's exit from the EU. The vote to leave the EU won by a slim majority and since leaving the EU the country has been experiencing a severe political and economic downturn.  Creating a public holiday to celebrate a controversial and divisive event would be inappropriate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we should not introduce a new public holiday to commemorate the UK's exit from the EU. The referendum on EU membership was quite controversial and it is not seen as a major achievement that should be celebrated. The overall economic impact of leaving the EU has been and is likely to be negative.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, we do not think we should introduce a new public holiday to commemorate the UK’s exit from the EU.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although the vote to leave the EU was close, it was still a significant event in UK history.  A new public holiday should be created to commemorate this event.  It is important to celebrate and recognize this event in our country’s history.
