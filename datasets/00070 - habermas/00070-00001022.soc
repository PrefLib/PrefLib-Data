# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of increasing the amount of foreign aid given by the UK government.  The reasons for this were that the UK has many problems of its own that need to be addressed first.  In particular, the cost of living crisis was mentioned, and it was felt that the government should be concentrating on this rather than giving money to other countries.  It was also felt that other countries should be doing more to help themselves rather than relying on foreign aid.  However, it was recognised that some foreign aid is necessary and that the UK government should continue to give some money to other countries.  It was also suggested that the foreign aid should be targeted on teaching people the skills they need to help themselves.
