# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that children should not be automatically registered with a religion. Each person is entitled to their own beliefs and opinions and so this is their decision to make when they grow up. Children should be free to develop their own thoughts and feelings about religion rather than being forced to adopt one which may contradict their future beliefs. Children can be brought up around a particular religion but we feel they have the right to change their minds when older.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children should not be registered with a religion. Children should be free to develop their own thoughts and feelings about religion rather than being forced to adopt one which may contradict their future beliefs. This may also lead to conflict within families.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, children should not be automatically registered with a religion. Children should be free to develop their own thoughts and feelings about religion rather than being forced to adopt one which may contradict their future beliefs. The group felt that it is imperative that everyone has a choice, children can be brought up around a particular religion but they have the right to change their minds when older. The group felt that it is fine for children to practice a religion with their family or in their homes. However, they should not be registered until this is a decision they can make for themselves. They may grow up to form different opinions from their family which would be made more difficult if their family had officially registered them as a certain religion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children should not be registered with a religion. Children have the right to develop their own beliefs and opinions. They should not be forced to adopt one particular religion as this may conflict with their future beliefs.
