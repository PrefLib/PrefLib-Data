# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a role for faith schools in a modern society. However, we think that it is important for all schools to teach children about all faiths and beliefs, not just the one that they follow. This will help children to understand the world around them and to be respectful of other people's beliefs. We think that the government should provide more funding for faith schools, as they are often in deprived areas and this would help to improve the facilities for the children. We also think that it is important for all schools to teach children about the dangers of radicalisation and to help them to understand why some people choose to follow extremist groups. We think that this will help to prevent children from being radicalised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Faith schools should be allowed to exist, but they should not be allowed to teach their own curriculum, they should teach the national curriculum and must teach about other faiths and non-faith. The participants felt that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views, and that it was important for children to be exposed to different views
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe there is a place for faith schools in modern society. In an increasingly secular society, it is important for the survival of faith communities that children are taught about faith. Schools run by a particular faith can help the community to bond and can be a positive influence on children. We think the teaching of the beliefs of a particular faith is a good thing, as long as children are taught about other faiths and are also taught about atheism, so that children understand all viewpoints. We believe it is important to teach children about morality and the positive influence religion can have in this area.
