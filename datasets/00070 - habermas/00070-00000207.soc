# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In principle, yes the UK should provide some sort of subsidy to poorer parts of the UK, but this should be means tested and targeted at helping those who really need it and are making efforts to improve their lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should provide some sort of subsidy to poorer parts of the UK. This is because the cost of living is higher in those areas and it is important for the government to ensure that all citizens are cared for and their living standards are the same, no matter where they live.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, the UK should provide some sort of subsidy to poorer parts of the UK. This would help make their living standards better and will make them feel included and that they are cared for. It is the governments responsibility to care for their citizens and by providing subsidy to poorer parts, the government will make citizens happy and happy citizens make better societies. The subsidy should be means tested so people that actually need the help receive it. Poorer is subjective based on where you live. There is nothing stopping people from poorer communities getting educated and moving to higher paying areas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should provide subsidies to the poorer parts of the UK. This will improve living standards for people living in these parts. There should be an equal distribution of wealth across the UK, so that everyone can live with a certain standard of living.
