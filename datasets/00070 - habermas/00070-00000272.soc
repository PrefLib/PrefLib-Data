# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, people who do not have UK citizenship should not be allowed to vote in UK elections. But, this is a complicated issue. For example, if a person is only living in the UK for a short period of time they would not know as much about the country and its issues as a person who was born and raised here. On the other hand, a person who is born and raised in the UK would not be as affected by a policy change as a person who will live here for a long period of time. A person who is living in the UK but will only be living here for a short period of time should not be able to vote, but people who live here for longer periods of time and have been here since their birth should have the right to vote.

Therefore, a person who is living in the UK but will only be living here for a short period of time should not be able to vote, but people who live here for longer periods of time and have been here since their birth should have the right to vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is a strong argument for allowing only UK citizens to vote in UK elections. People who are not UK citizens would not be impacted by the results of the election as much as people who are UK citizens. On the other hand, there are some people who have lived in the UK for a long time and are strongly affected by the results of the election, and these people should be allowed to vote even if they are not UK citizens.
