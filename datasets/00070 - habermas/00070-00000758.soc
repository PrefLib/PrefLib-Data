# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, parents should be required to pay for their kids' college education, however the government should provide support for families who are unable to afford to pay for their children's college education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, parents should not be required to pay for their kids' college education. This would create a completely unfair disadvantage to low income families. Not to mention the impact this would have on children who have spent time in the care system or are coming from abusive families. Children and young people should be given fair and equitable access to higher education, not dependent on their parent's income. This would mean incredibly talented and intelligent children missing out on the opportunity to fulfil their potential, and creating further stress for already struggling families.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, parents should not be required to pay for their kids' college education. However, parents should be expected to contribute towards the cost of their children's education to a degree that is commensurate with their income. This would mean that families on lower incomes would be expected to pay less, and families on higher incomes would be expected to pay more.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that parents should not be required to pay for their kids' college education. We believe that education is the right of every young person, and that it should be free at the point of access for all. We believe that this would improve social mobility and ensure that all young people have the opportunity to access higher education, regardless of their socio-economic background. We believe that society would be a better place if everyone had access to education, and that we would have a better educated and more informed society as a result. We believe that education is a right, not a privilege.
