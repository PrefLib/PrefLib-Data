# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - You would need to define exactly what is meant by 'cars' and by 'city centre' for me to give a constructive opinion on this in any way. Does "all cars" include, for instance, taxis and private hire vehicles used by the disabled? In that case, I would say 'no, don't ban all cars'. While I do in general feel that increased pedestrianisation of large city centres is a good thing - e.g. making Oxford Street and Soho in London more walkable through installing wider pavements, banning private vehicles between certain times, introducing traffic limiting measures like charges, increasing the amount of public transport - that's a different thing from banning all cars.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - This is another difficult one, because it is a multifaceted issue. Clearly, there is a strong link between vehicles in the city centre and pollution and so banning cars will reduce pollution. A reduction in pollution will reduce the number of pollution related illnesses and deaths every year. Clearly this is a positive.  However, poor governance over many decades has meant that public transport is often of poor quality, infrastructure and overcrowded. Alternatives are not easy to come by.  Then there is the affect on the local communities, local jobs and national jobs.  At present, with such poor leadership ...
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I think  that taking cars out of the city centre isn't the way to go. Why would they do this? The city has always had cars and it would alter how the city looks. For as long as I can remember there was always car in the city.  My thoughts are that it is only to pedestrian friendly places. I see nothing wrong in having cars in the city. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - This is a tricky one. There are of course going to be benefits environmentally and health wise to try to reduce carbon emissions from city centres. However at the same time there are going to be negative causes of this too. It is not a possibility for everyone to walk or ride a bike to get to wherever they need to go etc. I feel like as with everything we always go to an extreme at first when trying to make a change and then eventually it will balance out over time. The best way lies probably somewhere in the middle.
