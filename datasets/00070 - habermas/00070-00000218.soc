# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should make it easier for people to become teachers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: After a long debate, the group have come to a consensus that we should not make it easier for people to become teachers. We feel that it is vital that our students receive the highest quality of education and that they are taught by the most highly trained teachers possible. It is also important that teachers are paid well enough to make it a lucrative career option for those looking for work. We feel that more needs to be done to make teaching a more attractive career. More opportunities for further training, more recognition for excellent teaching, more help and support for young and inexperienced teachers. It is vital that teachers are supported and encouraged to provide the best possible service to our children and to our country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should make it easier for people to become teachers, but only after certain requirements are met. First of all, we should be making it easier for people to apply for teaching jobs. This would mean making it easier to contact school head teachers and also making it clearer that teaching vacancies are available. Also, the training required to become a teacher should be improved. As it stands, there are too many teachers with a poor quality of training. We should also be making it easier to apply for university courses in education. Although, we should be careful not to cut the length of the course as this would likely result in a reduction in the quality of training and education provided. Finally, we should not be making it easier for people to become teachers without them having a degree in their chosen subject. A large part of what makes a good teacher is the ability to connect with their students. This is particularly important for older students. A person who does not have an interest or understanding of a subject will find it very difficult to relate to students and will therefore be less effective as a teacher. Overall, the group feel that the most important thing is to ensure that students get a good education. This is more important than reducing the teaching shortage. The
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We do not think that it is necessary to make it easier for people to become teachers. We are aware of the current shortage of teachers, however, this is a shortage of teachers who have an excellent understanding of their subject and the ability to teach it to students in a way that makes them want to learn. We feel that the process of becoming a teacher should be made simpler in that teachers should be able to train for the position while continuing to teach. We also feel that the salary for teachers should be increased. We feel that this would attract a better calibre of candidate for the job and make it more worthwhile for teachers to make a career of teaching. We feel that making the process of becoming a teacher easier and increasing the pay for teachers would help to solve the current teacher shortage.
