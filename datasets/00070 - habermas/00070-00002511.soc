# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think this would be a good idea as holidays are very important for mental and physical wellbeing as broadening your horizons.  It may be difficult to administer though as it probably would have to be means-tested.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: This is a difficult question to answer because there are so many unknown variables. I am assuming we are talking about families on a low income who otherwise might not be able to afford to take a weeks holiday. The definition of "away" is also not defined. A week away from home might consist of a week in a caravan, or a week in a hotel in another country. I support the general idea that all families ought to be able to have a week of holiday time together, but I cannot give a firm view on whether or not we should subsidise this because I would need to understand which families were being helped, and what was meant by a holiday. I would be willing to consider subsidising a family on a low income, but I would not wish to subsidise a family on a high income, for example. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Having a family is extremely hard work. It can be stressful and exhausting at times, especially of both parents work full-time. I feel that just one week away could mean absolutely everything to them. It would enable people to go on holiday who may not have had the means before now. Children would get to experience new things, beaches, nature and new parts of the Country/World they may not have had the chance to. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, I don't think this is a good idea. It is of course nice for families to get a break and to go on holiday together, but realistically subsidising holidays seems like a band aid for a bullethole. The reason why families can't afford a holiday every year isn't because holidays are too expensive and need subsidising, but rather that wages are low, working conditions are bad, childcare is expensive, groceries are expensive, energy is expensive, housing is expensive, etc., etc., and all of these things come before things like holidays. Do something to support the cost of living instead and the people who want to go on holiday may then find they're able to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I believe that it beneficial for all families to have a break away from the everyday life but feel that this would be extremely hard to implement. How would we see who can and cant afford to go? Who can't afford because they are spending money on other non essential items and those who maybe due to disabilities/illness/work/caring commitments can't go. I would prefer investment into making sure everyone can eat and pay bills.
