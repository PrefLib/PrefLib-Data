# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Globalisation is inevitable and will bring more benefits than costs, if the costs are managed appropriately.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the conclusion that the costs of globalisation are outweighed by its benefits. We believe that by looking at the opportunities of globalisation we are able to provide a wider range of goods and services at a lower cost to consumers. This is one of the main benefits of globalisation. Globalisation also creates more opportunities for countries to trade with each other, which in turn can lead to economic growth and jobs. One of the major costs of globalisation is the impact on the environment. Globalisation is a big contributor to climate change. We believe that globalisation should go ahead, but the impact on the environment needs to be minimised. We also believe that there are some costs of globalisation that are worth accepting, as globalisation can provide so many benefits to the world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Globalisation has many benefits. The main benefits are the increased opportunities for trade, jobs and economic growth. The costs of globalisation need to be managed. The biggest cost is the impact on the environment. We need to make sure that we are doing all we can to minimise this cost.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that the benefits of globalisation are huge - with globalisation, we can achieve trade with low barriers, therefore improving the world economy in the long run. Globalisation also gives a wider range of goods and services at a lower cost for consumers. It also helps break down barriers, creating a better understanding of what other people around the world believe and how they live. However, globalisation does have downsides - it causes environmental damage, and it destroys our beautiful natural landscape. Globalisation also destroys many jobs, as companies are taking advantage of cheap labour and moving production overseas. We believe that globalisation should continue to happen, and we think that we can overcome the environmental damage through the reduction of greenhouse gases, and we think that job losses can be overcome with the right training and education in schools and through careers advice. In conclusion, despite the downsides, we believe that the benefits of globalisation far outweigh its negatives, as long as action is taken to reduce the negative effects.
