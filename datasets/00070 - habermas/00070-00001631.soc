# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that sex education should be part of the normal curriculum in schools. Sex education should be introduced in the child's life as an ongoing part of it from the very early ages. It is very important for children to be well-informed, and to be well-aware of what is happening around them and to them, to be able to keep themselves safe. Moreover, it is the responsibility of the school to inform parents about the content of the sex education lessons, as well as when they will be taught. If parents disagree with this, they can opt their children out of the classes, but only after a talk with the teacher/principal and only after finding a solution that fits the school curriculum and the family.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Sex education should be taught at school as a topic and parents should be able to decide whether their children will take part in it or not. Sex education is a sensitive topic and it is important that parents know exactly what their children will be taught.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of allowing parents to opt out of sex education classes for their children.  The group felt that sex education is an important topic and that children should be exposed to it.  However, the group felt that parents should have the right to decide what is appropriate for their children to learn.  The group also felt that parents should be given an extensive list of what will be taught in sex education classes so that they can make an informed decision.  The group felt that sex education is a very sensitive topic and that it should not be taught without the parents' consent.  The group felt that parents know their children best and are in the best position to decide what is appropriate for their children to learn.
