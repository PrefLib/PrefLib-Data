# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is a growing skills gap in the UK. We need to be more aware of what skills are needed for jobs, and what skills are in demand. We need to be more aware of how to get these skills. The group were tasked with coming up with an action plan to address the skills gap. Below is presented their plan. Action plan: We need to invest in more apprenticeships. We need to make sure that there are enough apprenticeships in the right industries. The government needs to make sure that it is making apprenticeships available in the right industries. The government also needs to invest in more STEM subjects and make sure that these subjects are available in more schools. We need to make sure that we are investing in the right skills.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In some sectors yes, mainly in the NHS. We have a massive shortage of doctors and nurses. One big issue I believe is that many people are doing degrees which are essentially useless.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We are in the midst of a 're-skilling' crisis. We are in the midst of a 're-skilling' crisis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the UK is in the midst of a ‘re-skilling’ crisis. With the rapid rate of technological development over the last decade, many skills have become redundant, creating a skills gap. We feel that there is a particular shortage in certain technical skills, e.g. in the technology sector. However, we also believe that there is a shortage in skills that are less tangible, such as self-motivation, communication and creative thinking, due to a changing workplace culture that is leading to more and more people having a tendency to rely on others. Therefore, the UK must do more to re-skill and re-train its workforce in order to bridge this skills gap and avoid a potential future crisis.
