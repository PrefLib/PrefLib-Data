# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the maximum speed limit for cars in the UK should be lowered from 70mph to 60mph. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, lowering the speed limit would reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the roads. Secondly, it would help to reduce air pollution, which has a negative impacts on public health. Thirdly, it would help to reduce noise pollution. Finally, it would encourage people to drive more fuel efficiently which would have a positive impact on carbon emissions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The current maximum legal speed of 70 mph on motorways is adequate and no changes should be made.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We have come to the conclusion that the maximum legal speed for cars should not be lowered from 70mph to 60mph. We think that the current maximum speed of 70mph is a perfectly acceptable speed on motorways, and it should not be lowered to 60. We do not think that there is any need for it to be lowered.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Lowering the maximum speed limit on UK motorways from 70mph to 60mph is not a bad idea. We need to consider that UK speed limits are generally considered to be too low by European drivers. There are a number of reasons why lowering the speed limit to 60mph would be a good idea. Firstly, it would reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the roads. Secondly, it would help to reduce air pollution, which has a negative impact on public health. Thirdly, it would help to reduce noise pollution. Finally, it would encourage people to drive more fuel efficiently which would have a positive impact on carbon emissions.
