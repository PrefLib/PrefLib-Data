# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should be spending more money on the police and armed forces to improve security in the UK. This will help reduce the crime rate, the threat of terrorism and improve the safety of citizens. However, the government should make sure that the money is spent efficiently to make sure that no money is wasted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing the budget for the police and armed forces in the UK.  It was felt that this would allow for increased security and help in the fight against organised crime and terrorism.  However, it was also felt that any additional funding must be used in a responsible manner and should not be misused.  The group were of the opinion that by increasing the budget for the police and armed forces this would help to reduce crime and also help with tackling the current issue of radicalisation and extremism in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although there are different views about whether we should spend more money on the police and armed forces to improve security in the UK, in general we think that we should. There are a lot of crime and security issues in the UK and we don’t think that our police and armed forces are well equipped enough to deal with them. We also think that by investing in the police and armed forces it will be a good deterrent to criminals and terrorists and make the UK a safer place.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “I am against the idea of spending more on the police and armed forces. This money should be instead invested in interventions that will ensure that people don't feel forced to turn to a life of crime. For example, instead of spending more on the police force we should invest in drug rehabilitation or mental health services that would in turn reduce crime in a particular area. When it comes to spending more on armed forces, as long as we have responsible leaders in government that know how to de-escalate situations we should not be preparing for any conflict. “
