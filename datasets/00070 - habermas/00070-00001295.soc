# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that a carbon tax is necessary to reduce the amount of carbon emissions. It is also necessary for the government to closely monitor the carbon emissions of companies. The government should also help companies with their emission reducing measures and give tax relief. The government should also enforce the carbon tax to ensure that the companies do not find ways to cheat the system. The government should also help the citizens by implementing measures to reduce the cost of living, so that the citizens do not feel the impact of the carbon tax. We also think that the government should make an effort to bring new providers of energy and new technology to the table so that the country can be pioneers in this field.

The government should also help the citizens by implementing measures to reduce the cost of living, so that the citizens do not feel the impact of the carbon tax. If companies are able to prove their attempt to reduce emissions, and their efforts are reflected in lower or reasonable product prices, then the consumers should not be subject to this tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that the government should impose a carbon tax in order to reduce carbon emissions and help create a more sustainable society. This carbon tax should mainly be put on large scale energy-intensive firms as well as waste producers and importers of carbon intensive products. Any support should be provided to help these companies to reduce emissions. It is also important that these firms are closely monitored by the government to ensure that they reduce their carbon emission. The carbon tax should also be extended to cover products that are imported from places outside the borders of the country. The money from the carbon tax should be reallocated to go towards building more sustainable infrastructure and provide support to individuals that are part of low-income groups. The government should also implement measures to reduce the cost of living for the average citizen in order to help relieve the burden of the carbon tax.
