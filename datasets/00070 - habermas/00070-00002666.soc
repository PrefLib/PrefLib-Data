# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the minimum wage in the UK is too low. There is a strong case for raising it to a level that is closer to the average wage. This would help to reduce poverty and inequality.  However, it is important to recognise that a minimum wage is not the only way to help low paid workers. There are other policies that could help to reduce poverty and inequality, such as a higher tax rate for the highest earners and higher benefits for the lowest earners.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The minimum wage in the UK is low compared to other rich countries. There are many sectors who are poorly paid and even if they are given an increase this is not in line with inflation. It is time to pair fairly a real living wage and end the millions suffering in the UK. Sectors crucial to the country such as our NHS deserve better. While benefits are higher than wages these people have no incentive to take jobs. If wages were higher and benefits frozen for a period work would start to pay again and we could both fill vacancies while reducing the number of benefit claimants. If bosses won’t pay better wages the government should do this through the minimum wage. A minimum wage is not enough, we need a real living wage.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “The minimum wage in the UK is low compared to other rich countries in the world.  It should be raised and the government should do this through the minimum wage.  This will also help to reduce the number of benefit claimants.  In addition, the gap between bosses and workers has never been higher.  If bosses won’t pay better wages the government should do this through the minimum wage.  A minimum wage should be an incentive for school leavers to start work rather than sign on for benefits.  Minimum wage should be an incentive to apply for higher paid jobs.  However, there is a strong case for there to be a 'national wage', payable to everyone.  This would mean that a minimum wage would be much less important, because people would be more relaxed about the need to push for higher wages.  Minimum wage should definitely be raised in the UK.  There are many sectors who are poorly paid and even if they are given an increase this is not in line with inflation.  It it time to pair fairly a real living wage and end the millions suffering in the UK.  Sectors crucial to the country such as our NHS deserve better.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should raise the minimum wage in the UK.  There is a strong argument for the minimum wage to be raised in the UK. This is because the current minimum wage is very low compared to the minimum wage in other rich countries.  We should also raise the minimum wage because there is an alleged shortage of workers in the UK.  If we raise the minimum wage, this will give people an incentive to work.  If people have an incentive to work, this will reduce the number of people on benefits.  This will reduce the cost to the government of paying benefits.  The government can use the money saved on benefits to pay for the higher minimum wage.  We should also raise the minimum wage because the gap between bosses and workers has never been higher.  If bosses won’t pay better wages, the government should do this through the minimum wage.  We should also raise the minimum wage because there are many sectors who are poorly paid and even if they are given an increase this is not in line with inflation.  It is time to pair fairly a real living wage and end the millions suffering in the UK.  Sectors crucial to the country such as our NHS deserve better.
