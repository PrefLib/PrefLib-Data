# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Doctors should be able to prescribe life-ending drugs to patients with terminal illnesses, but only in extreme circumstances. There should be robust guidelines in place and the decision should be made by at least two medical practitioners, and the consent of the patient or their family if the patient cannot give their consent.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of allowing doctors to prescribe life-ending drugs to patients with terminal illnesses. However, the group felt that it was important that such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, and that the patient needs to be in agreement with the decision. The group also felt that the pressure this would create on doctors to make that decision is another potential issue and can't be ignored.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, doctors should be allowed to prescribe life-ending drugs to patients with terminal illnesses.
