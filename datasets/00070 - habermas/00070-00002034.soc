# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Austerity is not the best policy in an economic downturn.  Austerity hurts the economy short-term and people have less money to spend as a result.  Public services get cut which cannot be a good thing, especially for those of a lower income.  The way to get out of an economic downturn is to keep cash flowing throughout society.  In some instances, you need to spend money to create money.  If money was spent on social services, people would have more money to spend in shops because they wouldn't need to spend every penny surviving.  Spending to create jobs can also work.  Investment in public services could improve public health and wellbeing, enabling people to stay in work and use less resources such as the NHS.  However, some restrictions would be necessary perhaps, but it can prohibit growth.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We think that austerity is not the best policy when it comes to an economic downturn. We feel that some restrictions on spending may be needed, but we don't think a complete cut of any spending is the best idea because it stunts economic growth and makes it more difficult for entrepreneurs and businesses to invest in new businesses. There needs to be some money in the system to keep the economy going - however we believe that benefits, public services, etc. are not the way to do it.  The best way to get out of an economic downturn is to spend money on jobs. This will get the economy going again in the long run and the money spent on the jobs should, in theory, generate income for businesses to create more jobs. However, there is also something in the idea of investing in social services, as people will have more money to spend in shops if they do not need to spend every penny surviving.

Discussion: This exercise taught the group a lot about the Delphi method, particularly that expert consensus views are not necessarily the best ones, and that other opinions deserve equal consideration.  Not everything makes sense when you first read it, and that's perfectly okay - that's where reviewing, and critiquing comes into play.  What this group learned is that it takes open-mindedness, and acceptance of others to really reach a consensus.  Their group philosophy was that everyone is equal - no matter what race, class, sexual orientation, religious belief or political orientation.  It is this philosophy that lead them to realize that they all shared more in common than they didn't
