# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that it is fair to ban parents from smoking in the car if a child is present. This is because it is a confined space and children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of smoking. The parent driving could also be distracted by smoking which can cause car accidents just like when people use their phones. The health and well being of the child should be the top priority. Children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of smoking due to their developing respiratory systems, so they should not be subjected to this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that it is fair to ban parents from smoking in the car if a child is present. The health and well being of the child be the top priority. Children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of smoking due to their developing respiratory systems, and it is important to protect them from these harmful effects. Parents who choose to smoke in the car with their children are putting their children's health at risk. The damage of second hand smoke is far reaching and still not fully understood but is definitely detrimental to a child's development and overall health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, the group of participants believe that it is fair to ban parents from smoking in the car if a child is present. The health and well being of the child should be the top priority. Children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of smoking due to their developing respiratory systems. The child has no choice but to inhale the smoke and will be exposed to the harmful effects of second hand smoke. The parent driving could also be distracted by smoking which can cause car accidents just like when people use their phones. It is the parent's choice if they want to damage their own health, but this should not be inflicted on the child. They have said that smoking can damage your health and have warnings on the packs, how is that fair on the poor child who has no choice. The group of participants believe that the health of the child should be the top priority and smoking in the car should be banned if a child is present.
