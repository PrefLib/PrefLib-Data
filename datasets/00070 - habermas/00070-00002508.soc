# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I believe that there should be a cap on the fees so that nobody is priced out of an education. How that cap is decided I have no idea. I also wonder if some courses should cost more to do as they would have too many people wanting to do them otherwise. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Access to education should be based on ability to learn and develop and not the ability to pay. Ideally, I would like to see university education free at the point of study and then funded via a graduate tax. This would allow the most deserving to study at institutions that reflect their ability and they would pay for that depending on success after graduating.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: CONSIDERING CERTAIN UNDEVELOPED SETTELMENTS, THERE SHOULD BE A CAP TO ENABLE LESS PREVILEDGED FOLKS AFFORD QUALITY EDUCATION. IF THERE IS NO PRICE CAP, THE UNIVERSITIES WILL BE JUST A BUSINESS FOR PROFIT
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes, as it stops talented and capable people attending and reaching their potential as they can't afford it. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I believe there should be a cap because the cost of university education as well as the likely costs of moving away from home are prohibitive to a lot of people in today's society. Having been to university in the mid-noughties I paid lower fees than students today but am still paying off loans twenty years later. As a parent, I am already worried about how to help my children afford the costs of university and they are only 7 and 10. I believe that if you want to go to uni and are able to achieve the marks to go then money should not be the thing that holds you back.
