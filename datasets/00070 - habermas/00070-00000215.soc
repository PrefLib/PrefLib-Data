# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of banning the smoking of cigarettes in public places. Most people felt that passive smoking should be avoided. Some people thought that in places where smoking was already banned, for example in bars and restaurants, that smoking in public outdoor spaces should be allowed if the smoking is taking place in a designated area away from other people. However, if the question was asked as to whether or not we should ban the smoking of cigarettes in all public places, then all people agreed that this should be the case, in particular to protect children and vulnerable people from exposure to passive smoking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should ban the smoking of cigarettes in public places.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, smoking in public should be banned, for the safety of the non-smokers and children, and for the health benefits of the smokers. However, it is unfair to assume that all smokers are stupid and should be banned from making their own choices. While smoking is an unhealthy and disgusting habit, banning it completely will do nothing but create a large underground black market and force smokers to commit crimes to get their fix. It's unfair to non-smokers and smokers alike to have to deal with the side effects of cigarettes, and smokers should try to kick the habit to save their own lives, but banning it completely is not the solution.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although smoking cigarettes is a personal choice, and we support a person's right to make their own decisions, the problem of passive smoking is an issue that needs to be considered.  Although we feel that it would be impossible to ban smoking completely, it is our view that it should be banned in public places where people can't avoid the smell or the smoke from cigarettes.  For example, smoking in a closed bus or train carriage should be banned, and smokers should be able to smoke only in the designated smoking area, which should be in the open air and away from people who don't smoke.
