# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, it's the only way for employers to pay the basic wage, although it may change with different ages, such as age 16 may have less income than age 25. It would allow employers to budget for their stadd and ensure everyone has a basic standard of living. Everyone should be included, even zero hours workers and seasonal workers if it is universal. However some employers may see this as an excuse to pay only this rate for most of their staff
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is important that everyone has the money to ensure a basic standard of living. Wages should be sufficient for people to afford their bills. Not everyone can work full time, however, so it would make sense that the shortfall could be made up from an alternative source.  Universal basic income would provide a safety net, and security for everyone. It might however mean that if you can't work and increase your money, you will always be considered on the bottom rung. Currently if you have savings, then you don't get as much in benefits as others who have spent any savings they would have. This feels unfair, as it rewards those who have't been as careful
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - i do agree there should be a universal basic income to protect the most vulnerable members of the society otherwise there is a serious risk of worker exploitation. I think it provides a good base line and help set a benchmark for government budgets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although initially it'll require a high amount of government spending, it'll offer a safety net for the more vulnerable citizens and people in poverty, while being fair to everyone. It could also create a more business friendly country, with more people willing to take risks setting up a business with a consistent safety net behinf them.
