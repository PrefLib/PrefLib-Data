# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be signs in libraries indicating that cellphone use is not permitted, except where it is used for a legitimate purpose that cannot be done on a computer or is an essential part of the individual's work, and provided that it is used quietly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We agree that cellphone use is distracting to those wishing to read, study, or research in the library. We are recommending that signs be put up indicating that cellphone use is not permitted in the library, with an exemption made for individuals who may need to use their cellphones in emergencies or if it is an essential requirement of their work. This exemption is intended to allow the silent use of cellphones.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Libraries are places to read, study and research. The use of cellphones is distracting and as such is not permitted in libraries unless it is an emergency or the phone is being used in a silent mode to carry out work tasks that require a computer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Signs will be put up in the library to indicate that cellphone use is not permitted in the library, with an exemption made for individuals who may need to use their cellphones in emergencies or if it is an essential requirement of their work.
