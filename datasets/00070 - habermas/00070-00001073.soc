# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Gambling is a form of entertainment and we do not believe that advertising can increase the potential damage. We think that the sponsorship can be seen as an encouragement of gambling, which is often risky. However, it may be hard to find funding elsewhere and would only encourage gambling in people who were likely to do it anyway. We think that football teams should accept this sponsorship.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that gambling is a form of entertainment and that, whilst it can be damaging, it is not the fault of football clubs that some people have an addictive personality.  Whilst it may be a bad thing for gambling companies to be seen to be sponsoring football clubs, we feel that the sponsorship is ultimately not as damaging as the initial instinct suggests.  It's a case of the sponsor benefiting from the football club's exposure and the football club benefiting from the sponsorship.  As long as gambling companies do not use this sponsorship to promote gambling, we feel that the sponsorship should be allowed to continue.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “Football teams should accept sponsorship from gambling companies.  This is a good way for them to make money.  Gambling is just a form of entertainment.  Whilst gambling has the potential to become habit forming and damaging, I don't think advertising it can increase this damage.  People with addictive personalities will form these bad habits regardless of whether they are exposed to advertising.  The sponsor on the shirts is a way for them to make money.  Perhaps it would be wise for them to encourage people to gamble responsibly but the sponsor is not promoting an illegal activity and therefore it should not be forced to prohibit gambling companies on the shirts.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Gambling is a form of entertainment that should not be discouraged. Gambling firms are more than entitled to advertise themselves in this way and football teams should accept this sponsorship as it will provide them with money.
