# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that gene editing of humans to prevent disease should be allowed. We also believe that the research should be strictly regulated, to prevent the abuse of the technology and to ensure that the process is as safe as possible. The research should also be carried out in a transparent way, with the results being made public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of gene editing in humans, but with strict regulation and ethics guidelines. This was mainly driven by the desire to stop people from suffering from diseases and improve the quality of life for many. However, the group was aware of the possible misuse of gene editing and how this could lead to the creation of a new class of people with access to gene editing and thus inequality in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, gene editing of humans to prevent disease is a good idea. It is important to consider the potential negative consequences, such as creating a class of super humans that can afford to edit their genome at their advantage, increasing inequality in the society. It is also important to have regulations in place to avoid the slippery slope of editing other parts of humans and leading to eugenics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There are clearly benefits to be had from gene editing to prevent disease. However, it is important to ensure that the technology is used ethically. We should not use the technology to try and create a "super human" or to give an advantage to some people over others. The technology should be used to try and reduce the amount of suffering in the world.
