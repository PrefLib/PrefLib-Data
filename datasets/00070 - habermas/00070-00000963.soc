# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was against the idea of eating dogs. The group thought that the idea of eating dogs was particularly abhorrent due to the close bond that exists between humans and dogs in the UK. The group thought that in general, the idea of eating any animal was wrong, but that eating dogs was particularly wrong due to the close bond between dogs and humans. The group thought that dogs are very intelligent animals and that it would be wrong to kill them for food. The group thought that eating dogs is particularly cruel due to the fact that dogs are often kept in very cruel ways in countries where they are eaten. The group thought that dogs are not necessary for food as there are many other options available.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the eating of dogs is not okay. This is due to the fact that in the UK, dogs are seen as pets, as part of the family. Dogs have personalities and are capable of a wide range of emotions. The way that dogs are kept and killed in countries where they are eaten is abhorrent and is not humane. The participants also felt that there are plenty of other types of meat that can be eaten and so there is no need to eat dogs. The participants also felt that in general, it is not okay to eat any animals as they are all sentient beings.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, it is not okay to eat dogs. This is because dogs are part of our family and have become domesticated. Dogs were never intended for human food. Dogs are sentient creatures capable of a wide range of emotions and causing them suffering, fear and distress keeping them in cruel ways is abhorrent to us. Dogs are not food. There is no need to eat dogs even if a person wishes to eat meat. Dogs are companion animals and not food. In our opinion no animal should die for food. Humans do not need meat let alone dogs in the food chain.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In the UK, the dog is a companion animal and not food. We have a special bond with our canine friends and it would be quite abhorrent to turn them into a food. The reasons for this are not just cultural but also related to the cruel way dogs are treated in countries where they are killed for meat. They are often kept brutalised and terrified and killed in non-humane ways. There are even festivals to celebrate such practices.
