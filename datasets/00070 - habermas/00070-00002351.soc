# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we should not force social media companies to censor bullying and harassment. We believe that the best way to deal with bullying and harassment is to educate people on the impact of their words and the long term effects it can have on the victim. Social media is a great way for people to express their opinions and it is important to protect this freedom of speech. However, if people are using social media to bully or harass others, they should be made aware of the consequences of their actions. We believe that the best way to deal with this is to educate people on the impact of their words and the long term effects it can have on the victim.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of forcing social media companies to censor bullying and harassment. The general feeling was that if bullying and harassment is allowed to continue, it can lead to a less happy, more vitriolic society where people are denied the ability to move on. It was felt that social media companies should not let their platforms become a breeding ground for harassment. However, the group also felt that it is important for everyone to feel safe online, so there needs to be some measures brought in so that people are happy to visit social media websites without fear of it impacting them negatively. It was felt that everyone should be allowed to disagree with an opinion, but that rules should be brought in to deal with it when it is personal abuse. The group felt that as social media has become more and more prevalent in the last 15 years or so, the companies involved have had to quickly adapt. It is now a lot easier to avoid bullying or harassment on Facebook for instance than it was in the beginning. You can block people, hide specific content from people or report bullying or harassment. However, the group felt that more should still be done to protect people. In general, the group was in favour of forcing social media companies to censor
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that social media companies should be forced to censor bullying and harassment. Social media is an important part of many people's lives, and it is important that people can use these platforms without fear of being harassed. It is also important to protect children and vulnerable people from this kind of behaviour. The current system of reporting and blocking is a good start, but it is not enough. Social media companies need to do more to protect their users from bullying and harassment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Social media companies should be forced to censor bullying and harassment. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the prevalence of social media means that it is now very easy for people to harass others. If this is not dealt with, it can lead to people being harassed for a very long time. Secondly, if social media companies do not censor bullying and harassment, it is very easy for people to harass others anonymously. This makes it difficult for people to know who is harassing them, and makes it harder to stop. Finally, social media companies have a duty of care to their users. If they do not censor bullying and harassment, they are not fulfilling this duty of care.
