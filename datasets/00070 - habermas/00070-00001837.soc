# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We agree that the UK should not ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. We agree with the previous argument because more work would be done in the UK by the foreign workers as well as the local companies. This provides job opportunities, and it is important to boost the UK economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK should ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. This is because the UK economy is weak, and needs to strengthen. The UK has high unemployment, and overseas companies can bring their workers to the UK, causing more unemployment. The UK should not be encouraging this. The UK should not be encouraging the creation of low skilled jobs, which is what will happen if overseas companies are allowed to bid for infrastructure projects. The UK economy is weak, and needs to strengthen. The UK has high unemployment, and overseas companies can bring their workers to the UK, causing more unemployment. The UK should not be encouraging this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We feel that the UK should not ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. The reason for this is that the British economy is weak, and needs to strengthen. The UK has high unemployment, and overseas companies can bring their workers to the UK, causing more unemployment. The UK should not be encouraging this. However, this does not mean that there are no safeguards that can be put in place. For example, the British government could put in a regulation which means that if an overseas company bids for an infrastructure project, then they must hire a certain number of UK workers. This would mean that the British economy will grow, and unemployment will fall, while also allowing British workers to gain experience working with overseas companies.

The UK has high unemployment, and overseas companies can bring their workers to the UK, causing more unemployment. The UK should not be encouraging this. We feel that the only way to make the UK stronger is by creating more jobs, which will increase employment and decrease national debt. The UK should focus on its own economy and infrastructure by focussing on UK companies. We feel that it is also important to use UK companies so that the UK has control over the projects undertaken.
