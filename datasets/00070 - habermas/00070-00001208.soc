# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although raising airline taxes would be a great idea, it would be unfair to the less well off as it would mean they would be unable to fly abroad as much as they do now.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We agree that raising airline taxes is an effective way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel by making it more expensive and encouraging the use of alternative modes of transportation. This can also generate revenue for governments, which can be allocated towards other purposes. However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of raising taxes. Higher ticket prices can make air travel less affordable for some individuals and potentially limiting accessibility. Moreover, higher taxes could impact the profitability and competitiveness of airlines, potentially resulting in job losses or higher ticket prices. Governments should also explore alternative solutions, such as investing in cleaner aircraft technologies and providing incentives for sustainable practices. Overall, the decision to raise taxes should be based on a careful assessment of the benefits and drawbacks of such an action.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to raising airline taxes. They felt that it would be unfair to increase the cost of living for the majority of people who do not use air travel often, and would not have a significant impact on those who do use it often. The group also felt that increasing taxes on air travel would not be an effective way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel, as it would not discourage people from using it. Instead, the group felt that it would be more effective to invest in clean technologies and provide incentives for sustainable practices.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to raising airline taxes. The participants felt that this would be detrimental to the economy, as it would make travel more expensive and discourage tourism. The participants also felt that this would disproportionately affect lower income individuals and families, who may not be able to afford to travel as frequently. The group did acknowledge that there may be some benefits to raising airline taxes, such as reducing the environmental impact of air travel. However, the group felt that there are more effective ways to achieve this goal, such as investing in cleaner aircraft technologies and providing incentives for sustainable practices. The group felt that these solutions would be more effective in reducing the environmental impact of air travel, while also being less detrimental to the economy and more equitable.
