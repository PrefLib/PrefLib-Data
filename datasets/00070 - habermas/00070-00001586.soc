# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: No, we should not increase the rate of VAT. In these uncertain times, it would be a terrible time to increase the rate of VAT. It would only increase the financial struggles that many people are already facing. There are other ways that the government can increase their revenue, without increasing the VAT. The current rate of 20% is already a significant increase on the cost of the things that people need. In the current cost of living crisis, people are struggling to pay their mortgages, rent, energy bills and food bills. VAT increases are a blunt tool that would affect all members of society including those already at breaking point financially.
