# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - i think they should, the enviroment is on a downward spiral currently and in a bid to reduce it i think any outcome to deter companies or atleast make them aware is a good way forward. with a tax being imposed is making companies responsible for what they are using
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I think a carbon tax is beneficial for the environment because if the carbon output of vehicles is reduced, it will help the Earth regulate itself against our emissions and the rate of global warming. Carbon tax will also get people to think about using more environmental modes of transport, which will make our Earth cleaner in the long run.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I think the government implementing a carbon tax might have indifferent views with the population. some might agree with it to reduce carbon while others might think it's just taking more money away from them. my opinion of this is neutral however as this could be either a good or bad thing in the end.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - This would obviously bring in more money for the government, but at the end of the day joe public is the one that will have to pay, so while this would benefit the ones at the top it would not benefit the public. So no it should not impose a carbon tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I am very unsure on this. I think it will be very complex to create and to collect. I am not sure whether it will solve the problems of too much carbon.
