# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a balance between making money and improving education standards. The UK should continue to fund state schools to ensure that the poorest of the poor get an equal chance to get an education. However, the government should allow for-profit organizations to run schools in areas where the quality of education is very low.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a balance between making money and improving education standards. The UK should continue to fund all schools to ensure that the poorest of the poor get an equal chance to get an education. In addition, private companies should be allowed to run schools in areas where the quality of education is very low. This will improve management and standards in these schools.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a balance between making money and improving education standards. The UK should continue to fund state schools to ensure that the poorest of the poor get an equal chance to get an education. However, the government should allow for-profit organizations to run schools in areas where the quality of education is very low. Conclusion: The group came to a very fair consensus opinion after debating this question. There is no need for government to be involved in the day to day running of schools. However, it should provide funding to all schools. In addition, private companies should be allowed to run schools as this will lead to a better management and higher quality of education for students.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Profit-making organizations should be allowed to run schools, but there should be a balance between profit and quality of education. The UK should continue to fund state schools to ensure that the poorest of the poor get an equal chance to get an education. However, the government should allow for-profit organizations to run schools in areas where the quality of education is very low. The government should have some input into day to day running ie ofsted reports where quality is regularly overseen to ensure standards are not compromised. Conclusion: As you can see, even though we have come up with a good consensus statement, it is not 100% agreed by all. The consensus statement has to be agreed by the majority, and in this case, the majority agreed.
