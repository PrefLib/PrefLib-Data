# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is appropriate for corporations to be liable for the crimes committed by their directors and employees. Of course this is situational and it's also important that the individuals responsible for the crime should also be charged separately. Corporations have responsibilities to the public and to their own shareholders. Where there is a chance that by neglecting those responsibilities a corporation does harm then it should be prosecuted. It's a company's responsibility to put safeguards in place to make sure their employees cannot act in ways that cause serious harm. Employees and practises should have appropriate oversight and where this is not the case then the company itself should be liable.  By making corporations liable we allow for people who were caused harm to find financial solutions to make themselves whole. This will also act as a deterrent for companies to make sure that their employees are not acting in ways that cause harm. This is an important part of the free market as it ensures that companies have an incentive to make sure that their employees are acting in ways that are beneficial to society.

This could include things such as background criminal checks and financial checks.  It is also important that there is appropriate oversight of employees and practices.  This should be done by the board of directors.  By making corporations liable we allow for people who were caused harm to find financial solutions to make themselves whole.
