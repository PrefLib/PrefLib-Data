# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a clear need to alleviate the shortage of organs for transplants. Selling one's own organs is a solution that has been proposed. Whilst this would mean more organs are available for people who need them, this is not a straightforward solution. The vulnerability of people who may sell their organs is a serious concern.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Poll showing how the participants voted on the final consensus view: Participants who chose "Disagree" stated, "people shouldn't have the right to do whatever they like with their possible as we have many psychopaths" and "it is impossible to get right. The impact to the society is too great, and we as human beings should not be encouraging this" Summary/Decision: With no prospect of a long-term solution and chronic organ shortage, legalising organ sales would increase accessibility to transplant surgery. With high demand and low supply, the market value of organs would skyrocket, and some organs, such as kidneys, are more valuable than others. Poor people may find organ sales to be their best way of earning a living. Through the comparison to rape, selling ones body does not give anyone an immediate right to the affected person's organs without consent. Although there are some advantages, like increased availability of organs and the economic benefits, there are also disadvantages, such as the individual interests and rights. If no regulation is carried out, poor people will be easy victims. Individuals will be vulnerable to coercion and pressure, and the lives of the poor and vulnerable would be at risk. The
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The majority of participants believe that it is not ethical to sell body organs. Moreover, by legalising the selling of organs, it could lead to people taking advantage of those who need the money. Those in desperate situations may be forced to sell their organs, which may cause them a greater harm. Moreover, if it becomes legal to sell organs, it will create an industry that does not create any value, but is simply catering to the needs of the rich. This will lead to the exploitation of the poor, and the creation of a two-tiered healthcare system, where the rich can buy the best care possible while the poor get left behind.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Poll showing how the participants voted on the final consensus view: Participants who chose "Disagree" stated that they felt that individuals did not have the right to sell their body organs. Participants who chose "Unsure" stated that it was an issue that they needed more time to think about. Participants who chose "Strongly Agree" stated that they believed that individuals had the right to sell their body organs.
