# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Computers play a big part in all of our lives and while some people may spend too much time on computers, we do not believe that we are too dependent on computers. Computers are becoming more and more advanced, but they will always require human input and interaction to function correctly, so while they may start to take over some of our jobs, we will still have the ability to do them ourselves. Computers play a huge part in the modern world, underpinning many aspects of our lives, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. Computers have made the world a much more accessible place, and made tasks which would have previously been laborious and time consuming, now quick and easy. However, we need to be careful of the amount of time we spend on computers, especially social media, as this can have a negative impact on our mental health, as well as our social skills and wellbeing. Computers can also be extremely useful in jobs, especially the creation of artificial intelligence (AI), and are being used more and more in the workplace, allowing people to perform their jobs more efficiently. Computers and their advanced algorithms can also be used to help predict problems, allowing them to be resolved before they occur. Therefore,
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the world is becoming more dependent on computers, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. Computers have become an integral part of both the human condition and the functioning of society. integrated circuits and miniaturisation mean that almost all electronic devices feature computers, from dialysis machines to electricity grid infrastructure. It's important to make sure that an over dependence on personal devices and social media don't harm the fabric of society and communities, but overall these present only a small part of computer usage, and the benefits currently outweigh the issues. The advent of large learning models and advanced AI may tip this balance into dangerous territory, but as it stands right now, we are not too dependent on computers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, we are not too dependent on computers. We have found a healthy balance between the use of computers and old school ways of living and working.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the world is too dependent on computers. This is due to the fact that we are more dependent on the services that computers provide than the computers themselves. This can be seen in the fact that if the internet were to go down, many people would be unable to work, and many services would be unavailable. While this is a major issue, it is one that is difficult to solve, as the internet is an essential part of modern life. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the individual to ensure that they are not spending too much time on their computers.
