# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Consensus View: In the opinion of the group the sale of alcohol should be restricted for the following reasons: - Underage drinking is a major issue in the UK.  Young people who have never experienced drinking alcohol are susceptible to consuming a large amount of alcohol.  This causes them to become very intoxicated, which is dangerous to the individual and those around them. - Drinking a lot of alcohol has also been proven to cause several illnesses such as cancer, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Also, if the sale of alcohol was restricted in pubs and clubs it would mean there is less pressure on people to drink.  They would also not feel so isolated when they do not want to drink.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The sale of alcohol should be restricted. This is because alcohol is a dangerous substance to consume and can lead to many problems such as liver disease and depression. Alcohol should be sold in limited quantities to young people to ensure they do not start drinking heavily.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The sale of alcohol should be restricted to certain times of the day and certain ages. This will reduce the number of car crashes and reduce the number of young people who start drinking alcohol at an early age. It will also reduce the number of people who become addicted to alcohol and suffer from depression.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the sale of alcohol should be restricted as it is a poison to the body and an addictive substance.  It also causes depression.  We should ensure children are not exposed to this toxic substance for as long as possible.  It is also a factor in many road traffic accidents and is a factor in many suicides.  The sale of alcohol should be restricted to over 18s and in some cases over 21s.  The sale of spirits should be limited, perhaps by age but also perhaps by quantity.  Moreover, the drinks that are more calorific should be limited as we have an obesity problem and drinks such as beer are very high in calories.  The sale of alcohol should be restricted in some ways.  Definitely based on age as I think it is really important that young people do not start drinking too early.  I do also think the sale of spirits should be limited, perhaps by age but also perhaps by quantity.
