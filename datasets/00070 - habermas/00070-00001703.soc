# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In the opinion of the group of participants, we believe that it is wrong to pay people different wages for doing the same work, with some exceptions. We do acknowledge that there are factors such as seniority, skills, experiences and qualifications that affect compensation decisions, and that industries may have specific pay structures based on market demands and the levels of expertise required. But we feel that a person's work hours and productivity can also influence compensation, along with location, cost of living and budget constraints. We feel that maintaining fairness and transparency is crucial to treat employees without discrimination. We do understand that some circumstances might require employees with less experience to be paid less for doing the same job role as someone else, but the wages should gradually increase over time to match that of more experienced workers doing the same job role.  This will help to encourage employees to improve themselves and increase their productivity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, it is wrong to pay people different wages for doing the same work. This is because it is fundamentally unfair to pay people different wages for doing the same work. It also leads to inequality in the workplace and this is something that should be avoided. It is important to note that there are some exceptions to this, for example, if a person is new to a workplace and has no experience, it would be acceptable to pay this employee less and gradually increase their wages over time to match that of more experienced workers doing the same job role.  This will also help less experienced employees be given a chance where as they might otherwise be overlooked in the hiring process for more experienced workers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, it is wrong to pay people different wages for doing the same work. However, it is acceptable to pay people different wages for doing the same work if the people have different levels of experience.
