# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should be taught about religions and cultures but not necessarily indoctrinated to any one particular faith. They should be able to learn and develop their own beliefs from the knowledge they gain, so they can live in a society that is tolerant of each other.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We don't think it is right to force religious education on school children. We feel that children should be free to make their own decisions about what they believe and that it is the role of parents to educate their children about religion, if they so wish. However, we do think that children should be exposed to different beliefs and cultures and that this could be achieved by teaching children about different religions, as well as different cultures, in the same way that they are taught about different countries and their cultures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While we can see the advantages of religious education to some, we do not feel that it should be mandatory for all students. There is a danger that mandatory religious education can be used as a way to force one belief upon a child, rather than educate the child about a range of beliefs and the evidence for and against those beliefs. We also feel that mandatory religious education can take away from the child's personal choice to study about beliefs if they wish to, as there are many children who are not religious or who do not believe in a God but may still want to learn about religious ideas. As children grow up and mature, it is their personal choice to either accept a belief or not, and we do not feel that this choice should be taken away from them by being forced to study something they may not be interested in or may not have the capacity to understand.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children should be exposed to different beliefs and cultures. However, this does not have to be in the form of religion.
