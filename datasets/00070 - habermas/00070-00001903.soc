# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that we should move to a different system of democratic voting because we feel that the current system does not accurately represent the view of the population. For example, in 2015 the Conservative party gained 36% of the vote, but ended up with 51% of the seats in the House of Commons. This is because of the system in which we vote, which was introduced in the nineteenth century and we believe is outdated. We feel that we should have a proportional representation system, whereby each vote is given equal weight. This is more democratic, fair and will allow smaller parties to have a voice.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that we should move to a different system of democratic voting. This is because we believe that the current system, which is known as First Past the Post, does not accurately represent the view of the population. For example, in 2015 the Conservative party gained 36% of the vote, but ended up with 51% of the seats in the House of Commons. As a result, in 2017 only 2% of the population voted Conservative, but they gained a majority in Parliament. This is because of the system in which we vote, which was introduced in the nineteenth century and we believe is outdated. We feel that we should have a proportional representation system, whereby each vote is given equal weight, and so the proportion of seats in Parliament reflects the proportion of the population who vote for a particular party. We believe this is more democratic, fair and will allow smaller parties to have a voice.

We believe this is more democratic, fair and will allow smaller parties to have a voice. We also believe that the current system creates a two-party system, whereby only large parliamentary parties can succeed. It limits the success of smaller parties or independent candidates. It makes for a system that is unequal and certain parties can succeed with fewer votes across the country. It also leads to some people feeling disenfranchised, and like their vote does not

We believe this is more democratic, fair and will allow smaller parties to have a voice. We also think that this system will be more representative of the view of the population, and so we will have a government that reflects the wishes of the people.
