# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The NHS should be funded by an increase in income tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the decision that the NHS should not be funded by a national tax on food. The NHS is an institution that is used by all members of society, and it is only fair that all members of society contribute to its upkeep. The current system of income tax is a fair way of ensuring that all members of society contribute to the NHS, and we do not believe that this should be changed. We believe that a tax on food would be unfair, as it would disproportionately affect the poorest members of society, who are often the people who need the NHS the most. We also believe that a tax on food would be an ineffective way of raising money for the NHS, as it would be very difficult to implement and would be open to abuse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The NHS should be funded by an income tax. Food is essential to life and should not be taxed. Those with higher incomes should pay more towards the NHS, as they are more likely to be able to afford private healthcare.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: While it is important that the NHS is adequately funded, we do not believe it is appropriate to fund the NHS through a national tax on food. Food is an essential necessity that cannot be substituted, so the tax would have to be shared by the entire population, making it highly regressive. This would have a significant impact on the poorer members of society, who are already facing challenges to their health, and may result in many vulnerable people being unable to afford enough nutritious food to stay healthy. The poor would be disproportionately affected by a food tax as they spend a larger proportion of their income on food. For this reason, we believe that income tax should continue to be the main source of funding for the NHS. However, it is crucial that this tax is implemented fairly, so that the most affluent members of society pay the greatest share. In order to do this, the current system of income tax should be reviewed.
