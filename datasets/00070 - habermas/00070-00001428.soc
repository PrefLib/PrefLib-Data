# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK is becoming more like the USA due to the way we eat, the way we speak, the way we act, the way we treat others and the way we think.  The UK is becoming more americanised and this is a bad thing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the UK is becoming more like the USA.  We are becoming more individualistic, less community orientated and more money orientated.  We are becoming more materialistic and are concerned with image and looking good.  We are also becoming more unhealthy, with more obesity and diabetes.  The UK is also becoming more unequal, with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  We are also becoming more brash and less traditional.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, the UK is becoming more like the USA due to the fact that we now have fast food restaurants and eat unhealthily like the USA. Also we now watch American tv and have adopted their language, in our speech and tv programmes. We are also following American trends in music, and we now listen to hip hop. We also spend money more carelessly and are very consumerist.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK is becoming more like the USA because we are becoming a more materialistic society. We are also becoming more individualistic and we are starting to be more competitive.
