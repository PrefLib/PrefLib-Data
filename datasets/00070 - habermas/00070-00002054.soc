# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “In general, the group was in favour of immigration, however there was a need for some sort of control on the numbers of immigrants coming into the country. It was also felt that immigrants should be skilled in a particular area, as this would be of benefit to the economy. It was also felt that immigrants should be willing to work in areas that the local population were unwilling to do. The group felt that immigration was good for the economy as it brought in a wider skillset and knowledge from other areas and ideas about how to do tasks. Immigrates were also often more willing to take on the manual labour tasks that locals were less likely to do. It was also felt that immigrants enrich the culture of the places they are, increasing knowledge of those cultures and bringing in businesses.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe immigration is good for the economy. There are many benefits to immigration. In fact, it is difficult to think of any that are bad. The influx of new cultures and talents is a massive boost for the economy. Not only do they bring in new ideas, but they also bring in new job roles, new businesses and can fill in gaps where the workforce is insufficient. It is also important to attract top talents to that the level of skills brought to the economy is increased.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Immigration is good for the economy. It helps bring in the skills we don't have, it helps increase the workforce and overall helps improve the economy and society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Immigration is good for the economy. It allows people to come to the UK safely and have a safe space. It also allows people to come to the UK and help do the work, especially in recruiting for the roles such as agriculture and care/hospital roles. It is also good as it allows people to come here safely and have a safe space. However, the money spent on immigration could be put to better use, and there are people in the UK living on the streets that could use the spaces made for immigration. Immigration has it's good parts and negative parts. It's good as it allows people to come here safely and have a safe space. However, the money spent on immigration could be put to better use, and there are people in the UK living on the streets that could use the spaces made for immigration.”
