# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “The minimum wage in the UK has risen a lot the past couple of years. However the minimum wage is still low compared to other Western countries. But raising the minimum wage significant would impact small business enormous, which with the current climate is not a good thing. Inflation is rampant and the same salary earned even only two years ago just does not stretch as far in today's times. Minimum wage should be compared to other Western countries and set according to national inflation levels. We need to grow our economy and will struggle against cheaper economies if we don't keep costs low. wages are one of the largest costs for any business. we need to remain cost effective globally whilst investing in more technology.”
