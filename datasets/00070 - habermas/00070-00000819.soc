# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group was in favour of an opt-in system for organ donation, as this would allow the deceased to have autonomy over their body, and would respect their wishes. The group felt that this would also allow the family of the deceased to have their wishes respected, as they would know whether the deceased had opted in or out. The group felt that the opt-in system would lead to a higher quality of organs, as the organs would be donated by people who were in good health, and thus would be more likely to be accepted by recipients. The group felt that this was a very important consideration, and would be detrimental to the system if it were not considered. The group felt that this was the most ethical system, as it would respect human dignity and individual autonomy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group of participants was in favour of an opt-in system for organ donation. The group felt that an opt-in system would allow for the wishes of the deceased to be respected and would allow for the feelings of the family to be considered. The group felt that this was very important and would allow for a system that would respect the dignity of the deceased and the feelings of the family. The group felt that an opt-in system would also allow for the organs to be of a higher quality, as the organs would be from people who are in good health. The group felt that this was very important, as it would allow for more people to receive the organs and would increase the chances of the recipient surviving. The group felt that this was very important and was in favour of an opt-in system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group was in favour of an opt-in system for organ donation, as it allows for individual autonomy and human dignity to be respected. The group felt that this was an important consideration, as it is important to respect the wishes of the deceased and their family. The group also felt that an opt-in system would reduce the burden on people to register to become donors, and would increase the quality of organs available for donation, as only people who were in good health would be able to donate their organs. The group felt that this was an important consideration, as it would increase the number of people who would be able to receive the organs, as the organs would not be rejected. The group felt that this was an important consideration, as it would reduce the number of people who would die waiting for an organ, and would reduce the burden on the health care system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group of participants were generally in favour of an opt-out system for organ donation, however they also recognised the potential drawbacks of the system. The group felt that the opt-out system would increase the number of organ donors and would reduce the burden on people to register to become donors. However, the group also felt that the system could lead to a decrease in the quality of organs, as people who were not in the best of health would still be able to donate their organs. This could lead to a decrease in the number of people who would be able to receive the organs, as the organs would be rejected. The group felt that this was a very important consideration and could be detrimental to the system. The group also felt that it was important to have a system that respected individual autonomy and human dignity, and thus felt that the opt-out system could be in conflict with this. The group also felt that it was important to consider the feelings of the family of the deceased, as they may not want their loved one to be a donor. The group felt that the opt-in system was more in line with this, and thus the group felt that the opt-in system was the more ethical system.
