# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Technology is a very important aspect of our lives and will become more and more integral to every aspect of the human existence. We should not be afraid of this as it will allow us to become closer, seek truth quicker, communicate to others all over the world and have a range of entertainment options at the click of a button. However, we must not become too reliant on technology as we may struggle if it were to suddenly crash. Therefore, we must always have some old world non technical solutions on hand as a failafe and back up.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, the group have come to the decision that yes, we are too reliant on technology in the modern age. Although there are many benefits to technology, it has also become a crutch for people to lean on. If technology was to fail, many people would not know what to do as they have become so reliant on it. The group feel that we should be teaching people survival skills in schools so that they can take care of themselves if technology was to fail.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was split down the middle on this question. The group agreed that the answer to this question is subjective and depends on the individual and their situation. The group came to the conclusion that technology is a double edged sword, it has many benefits but also many drawbacks. The group also agreed that we are too reliant on technology in some aspects of life, for example, in a disaster situation where the power grid is down, people would be lost without their phones. The group also agreed that we are not too reliant on technology in other aspects of life, for example, we are not reliant on technology for food, water and shelter. The group agreed that we are becoming more reliant on technology, however, the group also agreed that this is not necessarily a bad thing. The group also agreed that the world would be a very different place without technology and that the world would be a worse place without technology. The group agreed that the world would be a better place if people were less reliant on technology and more reliant on each other. The group agreed that we should be careful about how reliant we are on technology and that we should be careful about how much we let technology control our lives. The group
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of the use of technology, but felt that there were some aspects of life where it was perhaps not necessary. The group felt that there should be a balance between the use of technology and the use of more traditional methods. For example, the group felt that the use of technology in medicine was very important and necessary, but that people should not become so reliant on it that they were unable to survive without it. The group felt that it was important that people were taught survival skills and the ability to live without technology. The group also felt that the use of technology in warfare was very important, but that there should be a balance between the use of technology and the use of more traditional methods. The group felt that it was important that people were taught survival skills and the ability to live without technology.
