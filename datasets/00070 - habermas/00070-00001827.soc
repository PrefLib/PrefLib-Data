# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I think people should be able to wear what they want to school, because people will feel more confident and comfortable in their own skin, and it will also make people more comfortable at school.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of people being able to wear what they want to school, but with some guidelines in place. This is because people should be able to express themselves and feel comfortable in what they wear. However, the group felt that there should be some guidelines in place, such as not being able to wear revealing clothing, as this could distract other students and teachers. The group felt that these guidelines should be in place to ensure that students are comfortable and able to focus on their learning.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “We don’t believe people should be free to wear what they want to school, because if everyone is wearing different clothes and there is no school uniform, then people may get bullied for what they wear and the focus of the school would not be learning. However, we do believe that the rules on uniform should be relaxed to a certain extent. For example, if someone wants to have brightly coloured hair then they should be allowed to, as long as it is not offensive. And piercings should be allowed too, as long as they are not offensive. This would help children express themselves and they would feel more included. Because if people are not allowed to express themselves, they may feel like they don’t belong. Also, we believe that students should have the option to wear their own clothes on certain days, for example, every Friday, so that they can have their own identity, as well as a school one.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People should be free to wear what they want to school as long as it is not offensive and does not distract them or others from learning.
