# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The NHS should not offer individuals the right to buy a transplant. This would result in the richest people being allowed to receive organs while the poorest die. This is unconscionable. It may also create a market for organs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The NHS should not offer individuals the right to buy a transplant. This would result in the richest people being allowed to receive organs while the poorest die. This is unconscionable. It may also create a market for organs. The NHS is there so that everyone can receive the same level of healthcare despite wealth. Transplants for medical reasons should only be undertaken in terms of medical need. This should not be dependent on means to pay. The NHS should not be considering transplants as an income raising procedure, and it is also morally wrong. I would also suggest it would bring in the unsavoury side of criminal acts to acquire said organs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People should not have the right to buy a transplant. This is because it would take away from people who are the most in need and is an unethical way of working. Transplants are a very expensive procedure and we would rather see this money being used in other ways to help the wider population. It also would be hard to control the source of the organs and could lead to exploitation of the vulnerable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The NHS should not offer individuals the right to buy a transplant. This would result in the richest people being allowed to receive organs while the poorest die. This is unconscionable. It may also create a market for organs.
