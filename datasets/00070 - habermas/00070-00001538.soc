# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we should not build HS2 because it is a blight to the landscape and is harmful to the environment.  Wildlife will be greatly affected. It offers to reduce travel time from London to Birmingham by 20 minutes, which seems largely unimpressive.  The work is cutting through large areas of previously attractive Midlands countryside and replacing it with much less attractive train line.  The cost is in the billions and I believe the benefits to the UK have been exaggerated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: HS2 should be built because the railway line will make travel easier, especially to more remote places, and make these places much more accessible for travel.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that HS2 should be built because the trains will be able to travel faster and it will reduce the journey time. Also, it will be beneficial for the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to the HS2 project.  They believed that the benefits of the project had been greatly exaggerated and that the cost of the project was far too high.  They also believed that the environmental impact of the project would be very negative and would have a detrimental impact on the wildlife in the areas through which the line would pass.  They also believed that the project would have a very negative impact on the landscape of the areas through which the line would pass.
