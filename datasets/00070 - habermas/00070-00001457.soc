# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, social media companies should not be forced to censor bullying and harassment. The issue of bullying and harassment on social media is not up for debate and there is no doubt that the nature of social media platforms can facilitate harmful behaviour. However, legislation should not be introduced to address this issue. We believe that the best way to prevent such behaviour is through education. The long-term solution to preventing bullying and harassment on social media is to promote an understanding of the consequences of hateful and discriminatory behaviour and encourage empathy. We also believe that each individual must take responsibility for their own behaviour. Each person is responsible for how they treat others. The responsibility to not bully or harass others is universal and each person must take the necessary steps to ensure that they are not harming others. Furthermore, legislation should not be introduced to address this issue as it can be misused and cause further problems. It is not up to the government to legislate on how we behave. That is up to each individual person. This issue should not be politicised and instead, we should tackle this issue through education and understanding.

This method was effective in bringing participants with opposing views to a consensus opinion. It was also found that the Delphi method promotes a greater understanding of an issue by requiring participants to review each other's opinions and provide critiques.
