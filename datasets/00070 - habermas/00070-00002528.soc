# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I THIS BOTH ARE VALID AS LONG AS ONE DOESN'T ENCROUCH ON THE LIBERTY OF THE OTHER.  WITHIN THIS CURRENT SOCIETY, WE HAVE SEEN HOW THE FREDOM OF SPEACH HAS LED TO THE VERBAL HARRASMENT OF INDIVIDUALS.  ALSO, WE HAVE SEEN WHEREIN THE OVER INDULGENCE IN THE PROTECTION VULNERABLE PERSONS HAS LED TO THE VIOLATIONS OF INDIVIUAL RIGHTS TO MAKE A CHOICE. JUST BECAUSE U ARE "A VULNERABLE " PERSON THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED, DOES'NT NEGATE MY STANCE OR OPINIONS.  THIS IS SEEN EVIDENTLY IN THE GAY RIGHTS MOVEMENT VS THE RIGHTS OF PARENTING
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, freedom of speech should not mean that people are allowed to use hateful and harmful langage towards other groups. This can be dangerous and lead to certain people being targeted, often the most marginalised groups. People should be allowed to speak freely but not to the point that their words are harmful to others. The right to have freedom of speech should not allow anyone including politicians to use hateful language that causes harm.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Freedom of speech does not mean that the speaker has no responsibility for the consequences of their words. If someone chooses to express opinions that endanger vulnerable people then they must face the consequences and be liable for implications of their words. This will no doubt impact on the freedom that people feel they have to express any opinion they might have but this is a price worth paying for the safety of other people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No I do not believe it is. As much as I do agree with freedom of speech, there are a lot of very stupid and very hateful people in this world, just look at the comments on any social media post regarding women in sport, divorce, economic inequality or anything to do with transgender issues and you will find a lot of hate for women, the poor (or often younger generations who haven't had the same opportunities) or anyone who identifies as trans. I think there is a very fine line between freedom of speech and hate speech. I think vulnerable people should definitely be protected from hateful ideas as they may not have the capacity to understand why it is unreasonable, or to fully understand the consequences associated with repeating those ideas and acting on them. This has been used in the past to encourage vulnerable people into extremism.
