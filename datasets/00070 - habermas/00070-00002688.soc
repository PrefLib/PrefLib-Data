# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the concept of national pride is a tricky one. It is one that can be used for good or bad. On the one hand, it can be used to celebrate important figures and contributions to the world from one's country. On the other hand, it can be used to alienate and exclude others. We believe that it is important to have a sense of pride in one's country, but that this pride should be inclusive of all cultures and backgrounds. It is also important to recognise that the concept of 'national pride' is a very personal one and that it is something that should not be forced on anyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: National pride is a topic one has to be very careful with as it can mean different things to different people. Whereas to some for example the union flag represents the contribution the UK has made to medicine, science and general good to the world, others will see it as a symbol of colonialism and oppression. It is sometimes hard to draw clear distinctions of when national pride celebrates important figures and contributions from its country and when it can be used as an excuse for racism and exclusion. National pride can be encouraged if it is done so along a sensible and representative education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: National pride is something that is very subjective. It can be used as a tool for both good and bad. In this day and age, it is very important that the UK does not encourage a greater degree of national pride as this can lead to exclusion and racism. Instead, we should be looking to foster a sense of pride at a local level in our communities. This can be achieved by investing in youth facilities for our children and young adults, teaching them to respect and thrive in their local environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: National pride is a very difficult topic to discuss. The way in which national pride is encouraged is very important. The nation is very diverse and it is important that this is celebrated and not used to alienate people. There are many good things about the UK and it is important to celebrate these. The issue is how to do this in a way that does not exclude people.
