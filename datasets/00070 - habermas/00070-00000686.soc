# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group was in favour of a maximum wage for British citizens. Some felt that it would reduce inequality, some felt it would encourage more people to work in public service and some felt that it would make people happier. Some were against the idea because they felt that people should be able to work as hard as they want to get as much as they can. In the end, the group felt that a maximum wage would be a good thing, but that it would not be a simple task to introduce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There was a general feeling that a maximum wage would be a good thing, and that it would help reduce inequality. There was some disagreement over whether it would encourage people to work in the public sector, and whether it would be a simple thing to introduce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There was a strong consensus that a maximum wage would be a good thing for British society. However, the group was aware that it would be a very difficult thing to implement and that it would be met with strong opposition from those who are currently the highest earners.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There was a strong feeling within the group that a maximum wage for British citizens would be a good thing, as it would reduce inequality and make people happier.

In the end, the group felt that a maximum wage would be a good thing, but that it would not be a simple task to introduce.
