# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the legal age for smoking should be raised to 21 years old. This is due to the fact that most young people are still developing and the earlier they start smoking the more likely they are to develop a lifelong addiction to cigarettes. The legal age for alcohol is 18 and this is the age at which an individual is considered an adult, therefore the legal age for smoking should be the same. This would also bring the UK in line with other countries such as the USA. Raising the legal age for smoking would also be a great deterrent as it would be harder for young people to get hold of cigarettes. This would also reduce the number of young people who start smoking. This would also reduce the number of young people who start smoking and the number of people who get diseases associated with smoking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The legal age for smoking in the UK should be raised to 21. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the age of 18 is still too young for people to be making decisions that could have serious implications for their health. The age of 18 is also the age that people can vote, which is an important decision that has implications for the whole country. Smoking is a decision that only has implications for the individual, and so it is more appropriate for it to be raised to 21. Secondly, it would help to reduce the amount of young people who start smoking. This would help to reduce the number of young people who get addicted to smoking and who suffer the health implications in later life. Finally, it would help to reduce the amount of money that the government has to spend on healthcare for people with smoking related illnesses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the legal age for smoking. There was a strong feeling that 16 is too young an age to start smoking, and that 18 is more appropriate. However, there was also a feeling that 18 is still too young, and that 21 would be a more appropriate age. The feeling was that the later people start smoking, the better. However, the feeling was also that it is not the government's role to stop people from smoking, and that people should be free to make their own choices. The feeling was that if the legal age for smoking was increased, then this would reduce the tax burden on the government, and that this would be a good thing. However, it was also felt that this would lead to an increase in the black market for cigarettes, and that this would be a bad thing. In conclusion, the feeling of the group was that the legal age for smoking should be increased, but that 18 is probably the best compromise.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the legal age for smoking.  The participants felt that the current age of 18 was too young, and that the legal age for smoking should be increased to 21.  They also felt that the price of cigarettes should be increased, to make them less accessible and affordable.  This would make smoking less of a social activity, and more of a rare commodity.  The participants felt that this would be a good thing, as it would help to reduce the number of smokers in the UK.
