# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - After a debate, we came to the consensus view that a new nuclear power station should be built at Hinkley Point.  However, it was agreed that the construction should not commence without extensive safety and security features and safeguards being implemented.  The group discussed the need for the UK to develop an energy strategy which will meet the country’s needs for the next 50 years.  The debate considered the use of nuclear energy as a form of clean energy.  There was a consideration that it was not the ideal solution, but was currently one of the most viable options.  The group felt that the building of a new nuclear power station was more positive than the current option of generating power from a coal burning power station.  The group discussed the impact on the environment and the safety of a new nuclear power station.  The view was that as long as the new nuclear power station was built with modern technology, the environment would not be harmed.  The group felt that the only danger of the power station would be in the event of a meltdown which would be unlikely.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I am not in favour of a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, as it is a highly polluting and dangerous source of energy.  However, it is becoming more evident that we need to start using renewable energy sources to reduce our carbon emissions.  We are already one of the leading nations in developing renewable energy.  This is where we should continue to invest.  We can make our country free of carbon-based energy sources without building additional nuclear power stations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While the group understands that nuclear power stations can provide cheap and reliable electricity, they also feel that the potential environmental impact of such a power station cannot be underestimated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that a new nuclear power station should not be built at Hinkley Point.
