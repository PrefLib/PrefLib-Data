# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Countries should develop more solar and wind energy as they are renewable resources. The issue of the land area required to produce the same amount of energy as a traditional power station is a concern, but this is a problem that should be overcome.” The group of participants then ranked their opinions from most to least important, with the consensus statement at the top: 1. Countries should develop more solar and wind energy as they are renewable resources. The issue of the land area required to produce the same amount of energy as a traditional power station is a concern, but this is a problem that should be overcome. 2. I feel it is the responsibility of all countries to move away from fossil fuels and this is one of several ways to do it. Solar and wind energy provide cheap and no polluting energy for its subjects and although there has to be things alongside these ways i believe its a way forward. One day we will pay for the pollution that we are causing on the planet. 3. I am generally in favour of more solar and wind energy, but there are a few caveats. For example, wind turbines should not be sighted inland, as they are disastrous for birds and wildlife, as well as being unsightly. Solar
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Countries should be developing more solar and wind energy. They should be developed in areas which have the best resources to maximise the efficiency of the technology.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, solar and wind energy is the way forward. All countries should develop more of it as the energy resources from burning fossil fuels are running out and it is not environmentally friendly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Countries should continue to develop more solar and wind energy, but only after the initial impact on birds and wildlife, and the construction and mining of materials for solar panels and wind turbines, have been minimised. The group were careful to include the negative effects that solar and wind energy can have, but also the fact that fossil fuels also cause pollution. They therefore felt it necessary to continue with renewable energy as long as the problems with it could be minimised.
