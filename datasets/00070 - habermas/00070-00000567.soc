# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not acceptable to use animal products for beauty care unless they are a byproduct of other products, and if it can be demonstrated that this will not impact the welfare of the animal. The consensus view was reached through a combination of each participants’ views and their openness to listening to the views of others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the use of animal products in beauty care should be avoided. Where animal products are used they should be derived from an animal killed for another purpose (i.e. not just for beauty products) and the products should be made under tightly regulated conditions to ensure the best welfare of the animals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Animal products should not be used in beauty care. However, if there is no viable alternative then the use of animal products in beauty care should be permitted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, it is not ok to use animal products for beauty care. Although we recognise that some animals products are byproducts of other processes and could be used for other purposes, these products are not necessary in order to maintain a level of beauty care. If the use of these products results in the harm or suffering of animals then we do not feel that the welfare of the animals should be compromised in the pursuit of beauty care products.
