# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although oil from the Middle East will still be required in the future, it is our view that as the cost of electric vehicles become more affordable and the supply of them increases, we may be able to reduce our dependency on oil from the Middle East.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In time, the UK will be able to stop buying oil from Middle Eastern countries. As the UK is a small country, and is quite densely populated, it will not be possible to find all the oil it needs within the UK itself. As the UK is in the midst of implementing electric vehicles, we will begin to use less and less oil, and this will be more and more sustainable for our environment, making it better for the UK in the long run.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We don't believe that the UK will be able to stop buying oil from Middle Eastern countries. The price of oil in the Middle East is cheaper than anywhere else in the world. We don't believe that people will be able to change their lifestyle to use electric cars. If the government were to make it more expensive to buy oil from the Middle East, then it would mean that it would be more expensive to live and work in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In conclusion, we feel that the UK will be able to stop buying oil from the Middle East. We are aware of the current supply situation and we realise that this is a large task to accomplish. We feel that the UK should invest in the infrastructure needed for a green energy supply and it should be prioritised in the country's development.
