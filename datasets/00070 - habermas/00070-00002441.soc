# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There are pros and cons to this question.  We are all well aware of the obesity issues in this country, particularly childhood obesity.  We also know that in many areas fast food outlets are often the only option for food in the local area.  This could be for a number of reasons, including social deprivation, lack of local fresh produce, lack of investment, etc.  We don't think that fast food chains should be banned from operating near schools.  We think that a balance needs to be struck between education and making healthy options available.  The balance needs to be right and it needs to be easy for parents and children to make the right choices.  We think that public health bodies and educational establishments need to work together to try to find a solution to this problem.  There needs to be some collaboration to try to find an answer to this growing problem.  A lot of work has been done by Jamie Oliver and others to try to promote healthy eating to children and parents.  There is more work to be done, but it is not an easy fix.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In principle, yes, fast food chains should be banned from operating near schools.  However, this is a very difficult thing to police and there are many other factors that need to be considered.  The issue of obesity is a complex one and we need to look at the bigger picture.  Education is key and children need to be taught about the importance of a balanced diet and regular exercise.  It is also important to consider the impact on local residents and the local economy.  A ban on fast food chains near schools would also impact local residents and the local economy.  The issue of obesity needs to be addressed at the source and fast food chains should be encouraged to use healthier cooking methods and ingredients.  In addition, school dinners should be made healthier and children should be given a range of options to choose from.  The location of fast food chains should be looked at, so that they are still in the town centre but not so close to the schools.  This is a complex issue and all of these things should be looked at, to help tackle the issue of childhood obesity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There are many factors that need to be considered when looking at the issue of childhood obesity.  In principle, yes, fast food chains should be banned from operating near schools.  However, this is a very difficult thing to police and there are many other factors that need to be considered.  The issue of obesity is a complex one and we need to look at the bigger picture.  Education is key and children need to be taught about the importance of a balanced diet and regular exercise.  It is also important to consider the impact on local residents and the local economy.  A ban on fast food chains near schools would also impact local residents and the local economy.  The issue of obesity needs to be addressed at the source and fast food chains should be encouraged to use healthier cooking methods and ingredients.  However, this will not be enough on its own and we also need to ensure that school dinners are made healthier and children are given a range of options to choose from.  It is also important to ensure that children participate in regular exercise, such as participation in sports.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of banning fast food chains from operating near schools.  It was felt that this would help to improve the health of children, as it would remove the temptation for children to eat fast food on a regular basis.  It was felt that this could also help to reduce childhood obesity, which is an issue in the UK.  The group felt that this would be the most effective way of tackling this problem, as opposed to trying to educate children on the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise.  However, it was also felt that this could have an impact on the local economy, as fast food chains are often located in areas with a high population density.  This could also affect local residents, as they would no longer be able to purchase food from these outlets.  Therefore, it was felt that this would be more effective in areas where there is a high concentration of schools, rather than in areas with only one or two schools.
