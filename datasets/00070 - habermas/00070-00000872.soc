# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that the UK should build a new nuclear power plant. We think that this is because it is a clean source of energy and it would be a step in the right direction to becoming a greener country. We also think that it would be beneficial for the UK to have its own nuclear power plant as it would reduce the amount of energy we have to import. We also think that it would be a good idea to build a nuclear power plant as it would create jobs for people in the area it was built. We also think that it would be a good idea to build a nuclear power plant as it would reduce the amount of fossil fuels we use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of building a new nuclear power plant. The main argument for this was that it would help reduce the strain on other forms of power and would be a step towards a more green energy country. The group also felt that if it reduced the cost to the consumer then this would be a good thing. The group did feel however that the mining of nuclear fuel is said to be very energy intensive and so from that point of view it is not a good idea. The group also felt that if anything were to go wrong then many people could potentially be killed. The group felt that fossil fuels, while not ideal, work for the time being until a better solution is found.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of building a new nuclear power plant. The main reasons for this were that it would reduce the strain on other forms of power and that it would be a move towards a more green energy country. However, the group also recognised that there were potential problems with this. In particular, the mining of nuclear fuel was said to be very energy intensive and so from that point of view it is not a good idea. The group also recognised that nuclear power plants are a potential target for terrorists and that this could cause widespread damage if anything were to go wrong. In general, the group felt that building a new nuclear power plant was a good idea, but that it should be done with extreme caution.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the decision that the UK should build a new nuclear power plant. We believe that the UK should build a new nuclear power plant because it would reduce the amount of fossil fuels being used and therefore reduce the amount of pollution being created. This would make the UK a more environmentally friendly country. However, we do have concerns about the safety of nuclear power plants and the potential for something to go wrong. We believe that if the government can guarantee the safety of nuclear power plants then it would be a good idea to build a new one.
