# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While it is an important social service that we have access to reliable and efficient public transport, we don't believe it should be free. We think that in the current economic climate it is important that the public transport providers run at a profit so that they can continue to develop new and better systems that everyone can benefit from. We believe that to make public transport completely free would just put a bigger burden on the taxpayer, and that money could be better spent elsewhere in the community.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of subsidizing public transport, but not to the extent that it would be free to use. The group felt that it was important that people valued public transport, and that it should not be so cheap that it encouraged needless travel. The group felt that it was important to keep public transport affordable, but that it should not be so expensive that it prevented people from getting to work or accessing services. The group felt that the current cost of public transport was too high, and that it should be benchmarked against the cost of public transport in other European countries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, because it is not a necessity and would be unfair on tax payers. However, it should be made cheaper to use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Government should subsidize public transportation so that it's free to use.
