# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “There should be a reduction in the amount of plastic packaging used, and a revision in the consensus that has led the UK to be in the negative top ten countries for recycling plastic waste. Recycling alone is insufficient. We must reduce plastic production at its source. There should be an extra tax on things sold on plastic and better incentives for people to recycle, returning plastic bottles to supermarkets etc, it needs to be made easier to recycle, clearer guidance and harsher punishments to those who do not. Individuals have a responsibility to help resolve it. There is already enough plastic pollution and we could sustain our need for plastic for many years by simply recycling. There needs to be s greater incentive to recycle, it needs to be easier to recycle and harsher punishments if you do not. Certain industries should still be allowed to use fresh plastics - for example hospitals and medicine, but only when a recycable alternative is not realistic or safe. We must reduce the amount of plastic packaging. Much of it is unnecessary and is used because it is the cheapest option. It does a lot of harm to the environment and will continue to build until it because a major problem as it lasts too long. “
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: “Yes, we should ban the sale of all things with plastic packaging. However, we cannot ban all things with plastic packaging, as there are circumstances where it is essential and vital for example, in medicine and packaging for international goods. It is essential to recognise that recycling alone is insufficient and we need to reduce plastic production at its source.”

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Yes, we should ban the sale of all things with plastic packaging. Plastic is a pervasive and devasting issue, causing harm to marine life , eco systems and entering our food chain. by prohibiting the sale of products wrapped in plastic we can reduce the amount of plastic. Recycling plastic alone is not enough. We need to stop producing it. It cannot be left to individuals to choose the "better" option. The government should step in and ban plastic as it is severely detrimental to our environment. We must reduce the amount of plastic packaging. Much of it is unnecessary and is used because it is the cheapest option. It does a lot of harm to the environment and will continue to build until it because a major problem as it lasts too long. There should be an extra tax on things sold on plastic and better incentives for people to recycle, returning plastic bottles to supermarkets etc, it needs to be made easier to recycle, clearer guidance and harsher punishments to those who do not.
