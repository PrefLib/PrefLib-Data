# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We don't think the UK should have a national day as it seems xenophobic in nature.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of a national day. It was felt that it would be a good way of celebrating what it means to be British and also to celebrate the achievements of the country. However, it was felt that it would be difficult to choose a date for the national day, as the country has such a long and varied history. It was also felt that the day would be unlikely to be a public holiday, as the country already has many bank holidays and it would be difficult to choose one day to celebrate over all the others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of a national day. The reasons being that it would foster a sense of national pride and be an excuse for a good party. However, there were some concerns about the dangers of a national day with the UK's past in colonialism and the concern that a national day would promote a xenophobic attitude. Ultimately, the group could not agree on the date of the national day. Some thought the birthday of the current monarch was a good choice, whilst others believed that the UK was not really one nation but a group of different peoples and that this date would exclude many groups. The date chosen was June 21st. It was argued that this was a good compromise between all the different groups as it is the longest day of the year and it is a neutral date, not linked to a specific group.
