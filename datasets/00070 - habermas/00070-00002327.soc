# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, the climate appears to be getting worse every year. The current heatwave in Southern Europe demonstrates this well, as temperatures that are being recorded are breaking records in recent history. Natural disasters are increasing both in levels of frequency and devastation, such as the recent wildfires in North America. Governments and private companies responsible for contributing to this emergency are doing little to mitigate any effects, so more groups such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion are having to protest on the streets for just a minute piece of action to be done. I think we are heading into dangerous territory regarding climate change. However, I don't believe very much can be done while consumer demand is so high and big countries such as China are contributing so highly to global warming. The serious effects will be mostly felt by generations to come. as a planet we are definitely facing a climate emergency. with the rise of new technologies in the past 50 years we have relied on fossil fuels. this has meant that the chemicals released are destroying out atmosphere. this has risen at a very face rate. if we dont do things to take action then we will destroy the atmosphere making it unlivable for us
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We are facing a climate emergency and we need to do something about it right now before it's too late for future generations. The world last week hit a record temp and it's killing off wildlife and it's killing people. Natural disasters are increasing both in levels of frequency and devastation, such as the recent wildfires in North America. Governments and private companies responsible for contributing to this emergency are doing little to mitigate any effects, so more groups such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion are having to protest on the streets for just a minute piece of action to be done.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We are facing a climate emergency, but are not doing enough to stop it. The recent heatwaves in Europe and wildfires in America are just a few examples of the effects of climate change. It is very likely that future generations will be faced with many more extreme weather events, and this is why something needs to be done now. Governments and private companies are not doing enough to mitigate the effects of climate change, and this is why we need to act. The recent protests by Extinction Rebellion are one way of trying to bring about change, but there is a long way to go before any significant progress is made.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The climate crisis is extremely worrying. The scientific consensus is clear: we are on course for a temperature rise of over 3°C this century, which will cause devastating and irreversible damage to our planet and its inhabitants. Already, we are seeing the impacts of climate change and the worsening of weather extremes. If we continue on our current path, we will face increasingly severe climate impacts, such as the flooding of coastal areas, increasingly extreme weather events, and the mass extinction of species. However, there is still time to act. If we can limit warming to 1.5°C, there is a chance to preserve our planet for future generations. This will require a rapid and just transition to a zero-carbon economy, with a strong focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency. If we are to survive and thrive in the future, we must act now.
