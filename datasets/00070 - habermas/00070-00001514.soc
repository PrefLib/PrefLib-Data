# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is highly likely that we are in the midst of a 're-skilling' crisis. Skills such as manual and repetitive jobs that can easily be taken on by computers are becoming redundant. It is therefore vital that employees and businesses alike commit to supporting people to transition into new roles. It is essential for individuals to have adequate support to enable them to retrain and transition skills if they are to keep on working in the sectors in which they have always worked, and if they choose to do so. It is also important to prepare young people in education about the changes that technology is bringing to the workplace, to increase their confidence and resilience and help them to make more informed choices about their future careers. The working landscape is changing, but that is not necessarily a bad thing, as some employees may choose to transition into new skills and enjoy new roles, but it is vital that the necessary support is provided to make this possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is highly likely that we are in the midst of a 're-skilling' crisis. New technologies are taking over jobs that humans used to do and this is creating the need for new skills. Many people are leaving work that they once enjoyed and moving to a new sector. Many people are re-training to gain new skills to enable them to enjoy new jobs. It is vital that the necessary support is provided to enable people to transition into new roles. Highly accurate true Within this initial period of online discourse we explored possibilities and allowed ourselves to make mistakes. We were able to recognise that the use of discourse as a participatory tool for reaching consensus without prolonged deliberation with group members is not without fault. There are a few caveats to take into account: ● It is easy to get lost in the group’s interest in debating the problems presented and lose the thread or intention of the question asked at the outset. It is important that the facilitator has a clear sense of what the question means and is able to return the group to this. ● While it is important to allow the use of critique in the process, it is also very easy to forget to critique each person
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is a strong likelihood that we are in the midst of a 're-skilling' crisis. New technologies are taking over jobs that humans used to do. Many of the skills that were once required are no longer required. Many people are leaving work that they once enjoyed and moving to a new sector, often after re-training and gaining new skills. This does not necessarily have to be a bad thing, as people can use new skills and experiences to enjoy new jobs. But it is vital that the necessary support is provided to enable people to transition into new roles and for young people to be prepared for this eventuality. Conclusions: This week's simulation task has been very interesting. I was able to come to a consensus view with a group of people from various backgrounds about an issue that was new to me. We reached a consensus view which is a positive thing, although, I agree with some of the comments that were made about the consensus statement. For example, I agree that we should not just say that some skills are no longer required because this is not necessarily the case. Some skills may no longer be required in the same way that they once were, but they are adaptable and there are still some jobs that require
