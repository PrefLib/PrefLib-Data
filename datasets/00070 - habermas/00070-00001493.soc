# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the BBC should not be funded entirely by licence fees. We feel that the BBC should be funded by a variety of income streams, including the licence fee, as this would allow the BBC to produce the best programming possible and to compete in a challenging media landscape. The licence fee should remain as it helps to ensure independence from commercial pressures on the content output, but it should continue to be supplemented by income streams from the commercial arm of the BBC as long as that remains independent from BBC Public Service. As such, the commercial arm of the BBC can resell programmes overseas and offer a subscription service overseas while ensuring that licence fee payers continue to get the service at no additional cost.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It was agreed that the BBC should not be funded entirely by licence fees, but that it should continue to be supplemented by income streams from the commercial arm of the BBC as long as that remains independent from BBC Public Service. It was felt that a variety of income streams is necessary to ensure that the BBC can meet its requirements as a broadcaster and to compete in a challenging media landscape. It was also agreed that the license fee is important as it helps to ensure independence from commercial pressures on the content output, but that it needs to continue to be supplemented by income streams from the commercial arm of the BBC as long as that remains independent from BBC Public Service. The group also agreed that the commercial arm of the BBC should be able to resell programmes overseas and offer a subscription service overseas while ensuring that licence fee payers continue to get the service at no additional cost.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the BBC should continue to be funded entirely by a licence fee. It provides an independent voice that is free from commercial influence and ensures quality in all its output, including the radio and news channels. The licence fee is set in line with inflation, with the exception of the licence for over 75s, which has not increased since 2010 and is in need of review. However, we also believe that the licence fee model should be kept under review.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The BBC should be funded entirely by licence fees. The BBC is a public service and is the only broadcaster that is truly independent from commercial pressures. The licence fee ensures that it can provide quality programming for all and is the best way to ensure its independence and the quality of its output. The BBC should continue to be funded by the licence fee and it should remain free at the point of use for all.
