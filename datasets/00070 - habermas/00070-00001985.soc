# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the UK is about right when it comes to gun ownership. It is very difficult to obtain a licence to own a gun and this is a good thing. There are some areas in the UK where gun crime is more prevalent than others, and this is an issue that needs to be addressed. In general, the UK is a safe place to live, and this is in part due to the strict gun laws that are in place.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the UK is not too permissive when it comes to gun ownership. There are some areas where it could be improved, however. In particular, the licensing system could be improved by requiring that all applicants are interviewed in person. Also, it should be made mandatory for all applicants to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the UK is about right when it comes to regulating gun ownership. We are in the middle of the spectrum between very permissive (like the USA) and very restrictive (like Japan). However, there are areas where tighter regulations could be imposed to further protect our society. The issue is not so much the people who legally own guns but those who obtain guns illegally and use them for violence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK is pretty good when it comes to gun ownership laws. If there is any issue, it is that the law can be confusing for people who want to own guns but don't know how to go about it.
