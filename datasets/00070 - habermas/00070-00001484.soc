# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to moving to a cashless economy. The main arguments were that it would exclude the most vulnerable in society and that it would be a step too far in the direction of a surveillance society. It was also felt that it would be very difficult to achieve in practice and that it would be very easy to circumvent. The group was also concerned about the effect on the economy of people not spending and the effect on the supply chain of people not having cash to pay for goods and services. The group did recognise that it would be useful for some people to have the option to go cashless, but that it should not be mandatory.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Final consensus statement: A cashless economy may be a good option for individuals to have as an option, however it should not be mandatory as some individuals do not have access to digital means for it and it would cause economic damage in their inability to participate. There are already individuals that do not have bank accounts and would be excluded from a cashless economy. Also, cash allows some individuals to maintain a degree of anonymity and thus acts as a safety net for them.
