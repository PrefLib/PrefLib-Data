# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, we should cut down on the number of fast food restaurants. The food produced by them is unhealthy, lacking in nutrients and is often made with unhealthy fats, salts and sugars. The food is also often cheap, which can make it an attractive option for families on a budget. The food is also often targeted at children, who lack the awareness to know what is healthy and what is not. Cutting down on their quantity would be beneficial for the nation's health, which of course has benefits that bleed into other areas, like reduced stress on the NHS and a happier and more intelligent populace.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should cut down on the number of fast food restaurants. Fast food restaurants promote unhealthy food that is cheaply available. The food appeals to children and teens, who lack awareness of what they are putting into their bodies. The food is ultra-processed, which is increasingly coming under scientific scrutiny in terms of the impact to our health. Fast food is also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The food is often not fresh, and is full of preservatives, salt and sugar. Fast food restaurants are also often located in poorer areas, where people may have no other option but to eat fast food. Fast food restaurants also increase the risk of obesity, which can lead to other health problems. Fast food restaurants should be cut down in number, and the government should be looking at ways to make healthy food more widely available and more affordable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the proliferation of fast food restaurants has a negative impact on the health of the nation. The food is unhealthy, processed and generally lacking in nutrition. The government should look at ways to reduce the number of fast food restaurants in the country. This could be done by taxing fast food restaurants more heavily, and subsidising healthy food outlets. The government should also look at ways to reduce the cost of healthy food and make it more widely available. People still need to take personal accountability for their actions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should look to cut down on the number of fast food restaurants in the country. The food produced by them is unhealthy and is one of the main drivers of the obesity crisis in the country. It is also very cheaply available and is easily accessible to children and teens. This is not a good combination and it is not good for the nation's health. There is a need to reduce the number of fast food restaurants in the country and to make it more difficult for people to access them. There is also a need to educate people about the dangers of fast food and to try to get them to change their eating habits.
