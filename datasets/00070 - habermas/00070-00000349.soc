# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, people should be fined for littering in public spaces. Litter is a widespread problem, it has a negative impact on our environment and our wildlife and it can cost the tax payer millions of pounds a year. It is only right that we all play our part in keeping the places we live in clean and safe. People who are caught littering in public should be fined. If there is no bin nearby, take your litter home with you. We all have a responsibility to help tackle littering.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should be teaching people about the problems that littering can cause and how much of a cost it can be to the tax payer. People should not be fined for littering in public places. This is a terrible way to get people to stop littering. We need to be teaching people the importance of keeping our public spaces clean and tidy, and providing more bins. It should be up to the people of the UK to be responsible for the country they live in and not down to the Government to fine people who litter.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, people should be fined for littering in public spaces. Littering is a widespread problem and everyone has a responsibility to help tackle it. Littering also has a negative impact on the environment, our wildlife and can also cost the tax payer millions of pounds a year. I think that people who are caught littering in public should be fined. #LitterFine #Litter #Fine #Cleanup #Debate #Discussion #
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes, people should be fined for littering in public spaces. The way we dispose of our rubbish can have a big impact on our environment and our community. It is only right that we all play our part in keeping the places we live in clean and safe. Littering is a widespread problem and everyone has a responsibility to help tackle it. Littering also has a negative impact on the environment, our wildlife and can also cost the tax payer millions of pounds a year. I think that people who are caught littering in public should be fined. However, there needs to be more bins and the bins need to be emptied more regularly. It is also better to incentivise people to stop littering rather than just punishing them for it. A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft of a consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement by the participants, and the final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
