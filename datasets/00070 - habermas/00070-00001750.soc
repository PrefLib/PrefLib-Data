# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: It is vital that all UK citizens vote in all elections, and it should be compulsory for UK citizens to vote in all elections. In addition, UK citizens should be educated about the importance of voting and its positive impact upon society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should not be forced to vote, but more should be done to educate the public on why voting is important and the impact it has on society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the right to vote is an important part of being a UK citizen. However, as free citizens, we should not be forced to vote, as this would infringe on our freedom of choice. However, we should do more to encourage people to vote, and educate people on the importance of voting and the impact it has on our society. Education is a crucial factor, and by encouraging people to get interested in politics, informed on the issues and informed on the consequences of voting, people may be more likely to vote, or at least to feel as though they are making an informed decision.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The right to vote is an important part of being a UK citizen. However, we should not be forced to vote, as this would infringe on our freedom of choice. We should instead do more to encourage people to vote, and educate people on the importance of voting and the impact it has on our society. The reason for this view is that voting is an important part of living in a democratic society, and it is important that all voices are heard when deciding on important issues for the whole country. It is important to recognise that making voting compulsory would mean that people who do not agree with the system would be forced to take part, and this would infringe on personal freedoms. Instead, we should be doing more to encourage people to vote, and the best way to do this is by educating people on the importance of voting and the impact it has on society, as this will help people feel more motivated to vote.
