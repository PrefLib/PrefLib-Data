# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the idea of teaching children to play a musical instrument is positive. There should be a flexible approach, taking into account individual differences and willingness of the children. Each child should have the opportunity to learn and play at least one instrument. Schools should have the necessary instruments, equipment, and tools.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children should have the opportunity to learn and play at least one instrument. If they enjoy doing so, they should be allowed to continue. Music is an enjoyable activity that has many benefits for the individual. The government should allocate more money for music education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should be given the opportunity to play an instrument. Music education should be of a high quality. Learning to play an instrument should be optional. Those children that are good at playing instruments should be given the opportunity to develop their talent. There should be a flexible approach to teaching music, taking into account individual differences and willingness of the children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Teaching children to play a musical instrument is a positive activity. All children should have the opportunity to try playing at least one instrument. The quality of music education should be improved and the government should allocate more money for it. There is a need for further research on the benefits of learning to play a musical instrument. (c)  The above approach can be used for tackling most any topic of social interest, but to illustrate its value for teaching young children, it will be used to address the topic of interracial relationships. This topic has been chosen since it is timely, topical, and likely to be of interest to a wide range of individuals, both adults and children.
