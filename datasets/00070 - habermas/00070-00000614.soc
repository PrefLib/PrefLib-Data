# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a higher tax on sugar in food and drinks. The higher tax will hopefully discourage people from consuming unhealthy food and drinks that contain sugar. This will hopefully lower the number of people who have diabetes and obesity. The tax will also hopefully encourage people to buy healthier food and drinks.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the conclusion that there should be a higher tax on sugar in food and drinks. We think that this is a necessary step to prevent obesity and diabetes. Sugar is an unnecessary additive and people will be less likely to consume it if the price is higher. There will be an initial impact on businesses, however this will be outweighed by the health benefits of the tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a higher tax on sugar in food and drinks. Sugar is an unnecessary addictive poison.  Sugar causes obesity and diabetes, and there's no need for it.  A very high tax on sugar will naturally sway people towards healthier options.  Perhaps the sugar tax could be used to subsidise sugar free products so they are even cheaper.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a higher tax on sugar in food and drink as it will reduce obesity and encourage people to eat a healthier diet. However, the higher tax should be used to subsidise sugar free products so they are cheaper. This will mean that the tax is fair and will not punish those that eat a balanced diet.
