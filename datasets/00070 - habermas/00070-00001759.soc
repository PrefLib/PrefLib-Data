# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While the science of injury prevention shows that helmets have the potential to save lives and reduce harm, there are some limitations. First, helmet use does not prevent injury from neck and spinal cord injuries, nor does it address the risk of accident itself. There is also a possible link between helmet use and increased injury severity when accidents occur, which is difficult to study because helmet wearers tend to have more severe accidents than non-wearers. The effect is small and the evidence is inconsistent, but it cannot be dismissed. In relation to mandatory helmet laws, there is concern that helmet legislation may discourage cycling, and thus decrease the overall health benefits of cycling and increase the risk of obesity. However, there is no evidence that this occurs. Mandatory helmet laws do not prevent all accidents, but they do reduce head injuries and have the potential to save lives. In general, legislation should be backed by strong evidence, so it seems that helmet laws should be in place in order to protect cyclists and other road users. There is currently a debate whether helmets should be compulsory for motorcyclists and scooter drivers. Similarly, there are many reasons to wear a helmet and many reasons not to wear a helmet, but the best option is
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should be forced to wear helmets when cycling. Head injuries are such a common occurrence in relation to cycling accidents weather that it connected with a general cycle accident or collision with vehicle. Wearing a helmet would protect people as opposed to not wearing one. I have had family members have serious injuries from simply falling of their bike in weather conditions and caused significant harm to themselves and the outcome would of been very different if they had a helmet on. I also think it should be a forced law to wear a helmet when cycling as most of the time they do use up space on the road which is occupied by cars, vans, lorries so they are putting themselves in danger.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should not be forced to wear helmets when cycling. However, it is strongly encouraged by the government to wear one for safety purposes and it should be made clear that this is the case in relation to any incidents that occur in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should be encouraged to wear helmets when cycling, but not forced to do so.
