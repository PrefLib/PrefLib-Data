# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should do more to protect the environment. We are destroying it and it is the future generations which will pay the price so it is everyone's job, the public and the government, to do what we can for the environment. We are already seeing the effects of climate change around the world, it is a threat to humans and animals. The government is able to allocate funds elsewhere for defence, public spending, etc. and has the funds to put into the environment due to the ripple effect that environmental concerns have on the rest of our life.  We have a responsibility to engage with the government and actively take part in environmentally friendly behaviours.  It is important that the government invests in programs which reach out to communities and enable greater impact for the good.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should do more to protect the environment. The environment is everyone's responsibility, and as the government is able to provide support for other services and departments, they should look to do more to protect the environment.  We should be involved in the changes that the government makes and work with them to protect the environment, so that future generations can enjoy the same privileges as we have.  We must use our resources wisely, and ensure that the government is also doing so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “We feel the government should do more to protect the environment. The government is able to allocate funds elsewhere for defence, public spending, etc. and has the funds to put into the environment due to the ripple effect that environmental concerns have on the rest of our life. We have a responsibility to engage with the government and actively take part in environmentally friendly behaviours. It is important that the government invests in programs which reach out to communities and enable greater impact for the good. Everyone has a responsibility to help with this and change to the environment over recent years it is clear to see how much this is changing the world. Not caring for the environment now could cost the government more in terms of health costs, economy hits and more so it is important that they act now.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the government should do more to protect the environment.  This is because it is something that affects everyone on the planet as well as for the next generations.  Not doing enough now will only make the problem worse in the future, which may cost future governments even more.  Changes to the environment over recent years (even the last fifty years) it is clear to see how much this is changing the world (adverse weather conditions, natural disasters etc).  Not caring for the environment now could cost the government more in terms of health costs, economy hits and more so it is important that they act now.  The government is able to allocate funds elsewhere for defence, public spending, etc. and has the funds to put into the environment due to the ripple effect that environmental concerns have on the rest of our life.  We have a responsibility to engage with the government and actively take part in environmentally friendly behaviours.  It is important that the government invests in programs which reach out to communities and enable greater impact for the good.
