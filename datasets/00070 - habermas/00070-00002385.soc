# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of increasing fuel taxes, but with some caveats. It was felt that the increase in taxes should be gradual, to allow people time to adjust. It was also felt that the increase in taxes should be accompanied by a significant improvement in public transport, to allow people to switch to using that instead of their cars. The group was also in favour of the idea of offering tax breaks for people who switch to electric vehicles, as this would help to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Fuel prices should not be increased to reduce pollution. The increase in taxes would hit the poorest in society hard, who would be unable to afford to travel. The wealthy would not feel the pinch and would continue to pollute. It would also be a very unpopular decision with working class people who would struggle to pay higher taxes and would disincentivise them when it comes to using less fuel and caring about pollution, when they see the wealthy that use the most, not being discouraged from polluting the planet. The wealthy would continue to use private jets and other industrial businesses, such as natural gas companies. Other major sources are the use of electric batteries, which are created using extensive mining, harming the Earth more than a typical petrol or diesel car. There are more effective and less harmful alternatives to reduce pollution by motor vehicles such as improving public transport to encourage people to use them, and incentives towards swapping to electric vehicles. This will require investment in infrastructure, which can only be achieved by higher taxation.  To do this in a capitalist society the only way to achieve it is to make it completely economically impossible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of increasing taxes on fossil fuels.  We all agreed that this would help to reduce pollution.  However, we also agreed that there would be some negative consequences, such as increased transport costs, which would be felt by poorer people more than the wealthy.  We discussed that this would increase the gap between the rich and the poor and would be socially divisive.  We also discussed that this would have negative effects on businesses that rely on the transport of goods and services, such as couriers and delivery companies, which may lead to increased costs for consumers and could lead to businesses going out of business.  We discussed that it would be better to use the tax revenue to subsidise the cost of public transport for poorer people, who would be most affected by the increased cost of fuel, to help mitigate the negative effects of the increased tax.
