# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While we were against a sugar tax, we agreed that we should encourage healthier eating and we think this can be done by working with the food industry to improve food labelling to show how much sugar is in each product and to reduce the sugar in food. We also agreed that the government should invest in healthy cooking programmes, particularly for young people. We think that the government should also look at how to make healthy food cheaper than junk food.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While the jury recognised that taxing sugary foods is a very broad measure, and that it would not directly influence peoples' behaviour, it could be used to provide a wider platform for more targeted public health campaigns and to raise money for them. The jury also believed that a sugar tax would not address the core issue, which is that processed foods are too cheap. A better approach would be to use the tax as a catalyst to lower the price of fresh fruit and vegetables and wholemeal bread and increase its availability in poorer areas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Citizen's Jury
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Taxing sugary foods would be a good way to encourage healthier eating. This will only be effective if the tax revenue is used to reduce the cost of healthy food and if sugar-free alternatives are promoted.
