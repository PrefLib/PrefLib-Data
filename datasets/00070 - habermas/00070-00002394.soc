# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that it is not wrong to pay people different wages for doing the same work. This is because there are a variety of factors that can be taken into consideration when deciding how much somebody should be paid, including how good they are at their job, how long they have worked for the company, how much they help other employees etc...  If anything I think it is wrong to pay a brand new starter the same wage as somebody who has worked in the job for a long time.  An occasion when it would be wrong to pay two people different amounts would be if they started at the same time and had the same experience.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, it is wrong to pay people different wages for doing the same work.  It is unfair to pay someone less because of their gender, their age, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation, their disability or their religious beliefs.  However, there are cases where it is appropriate to pay different wages to people doing the same work.  For example, it is fair to pay someone more if they are more experienced, or if they are more productive.  In these cases, the different pay reflects the different levels of effort or skill required to complete the work.

We also think that it is wrong to pay people different amounts due to factors such as age, race and gender.  Factors related to time of service and performance are perfectly acceptable when deciding how much somebody should be paid.
