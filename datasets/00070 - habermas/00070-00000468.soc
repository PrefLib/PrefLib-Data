# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a law against bullying in school. However it is important to note that a law alone will not stop the bullying. We should not make the parents of the children who bully accountable for the actions of their children. It is the schools responsibility to tackle the bullying. If a child bullies in school it is the responsibility of the school to stop it, not the parents of the child who is bullying. If the parents of the child who is being bullied are not happy with the schools response then they should have the right to make a complaint. There should also be a consequence for the children who bully. This could be done through the use of a bullying diary and if a child is caught bullying more than twice they should be given a punishment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There is no doubt that bullying in schools needs to be tackled. It is very difficult for teachers to be the policeman of this and I think a law would make parents take a bit more responsibility for their children. However, because bullying happens all over the world in different settings, I believe a law would not be the most effective way of stopping it. It would be very difficult to put a law on bullying as people that bully have usually been bullied themselves and there could be something deeper neurologically as to why they choose to bully. It is very difficult to prove that a person has been bullied, particularly when you take into consideration that a child may not have told their parents about it. I believe that there are lots of different ways to stop/lessen bullying without the need of a law.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No law should be put in place against bullying, however, a body should be formed to help deal with the issue of bullying in schools. The body should be comprised of a group of people from different backgrounds including a representative from each school in the country. The body should help schools create an anti-bullying plan and help implement it. Schools should also be made responsible for dealing with bullying that happens outside of school grounds but this can be dealt with through the existing mechanisms in place. If the bullying is so severe that it requires the attention of the law then this is an option that can be explored.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, there should be a law against bullying. It's hard to put a law in place but a good system should be put in place where it's reported to the teachers or parents of the child that is being bullied. The bully should then be put into isolation. The parents should be informed of the situation and if it continues, it should then be dealt with by a higher authority.
