# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the BBC should be politically neutral. However, political neutrality does not mean giving equal weight to every political opinion. The BBC is one of the country's most watched channels and organisations. It should display neutral arguments so people can make their own decision. It should allow both the right and the left to speak. It is important that the BBC, as a publicly funded organisation, is politically neutral, but it should not necessarily give every political opinion the same weight. The BBC should be like a newswire service: stating the facts of the news with no opinion. It is important to point out that political neutrality is not the same as giving every political opinion the same weight: i.e. climate change deniers should not be platformed on the BBC as an "alternative viewpoint" to climate change supporters in a way to be politically neutral. Instead the BBC should be like a newswire service: stating the facts of the news with no opinion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The BBC should be legally compelled to be politically neutral as it is a publicly funded organisation, allowing it to be private and political would not be representative of all of the UK and would lead to inequality of access to information. It should be representative of the entire population that are contributing to the very existence of the BBC and this is the reason it should stay neutral.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The BBC is a public service broadcaster funded by the taxpayer, and for this reason alone it should be compelled to be politically neutral. A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The BBC should be legally compelled to be politically neutral. This opinion is backed up by the following reasons and arguments: The BBC is funded by the British people through their TV license fee. The organisation is therefore owned by the British people, it is in fact their news organisation. Therefore, the organisation should report news in a neutral manner. This way it does not unfairly or wrongly portray any political view.
