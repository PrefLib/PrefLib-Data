# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the idea of having a nuclear power station in every town is not a good idea. There are many factors to consider when thinking about this idea. The idea of having one in every town is very impractical and would not be possible in most towns. The idea of having one in every town is not a good idea because there are many factors to consider. If something went wrong in a nuclear power station it would be very dangerous and could cause a catastrophe. There are many other ways to get energy that are not as dangerous. Nuclear power stations are very expensive to build and maintain. This is another reason why it is not a good idea to have one in every town.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We generally do not agree that it is a good idea to have a nuclear power station in every town. The idea of having a nuclear power station in every town is impractical, dangerous, and too costly. Nuclear power stations are very expensive to build and are even more expensive to maintain. If a power station in one of the towns went wrong it would be a catastrophe. There are many different ways to get energy that is not dangerous and would not be as expensive. In general, we would not support the idea of having one in every town. We received some feedback on this project, for example, I would advise that the group spend more time discussing. To create a consensus, everyone needs to be in agreement. ... Starting off with the disagreements and tackling them individually would help ... I thought a lot of this debate was more of an agreement but there were many differences that needed to be worked out ... [and on the final consensus] You should spell out the exact circumstance. The statement is too general and unsure...Be more specific in order to reach a stronger and clearer statement...The drafting and critiquing of this statement needs more time and effort... I've tried to bring a degree of organisation to the
