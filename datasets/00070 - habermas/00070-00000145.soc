# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Freedom of speech is a very important human right, however, the limits of this freedom should be enforced when one’s speech has the potential to cause unnecessary harm and distress to others.” After reading the question and each individual’s opinion, the group came to the consensus statement.  The only two participants that expressed a belief in the statement were the first two, who expressed that freedom of speech should be limited in the case of causing harm.  The third, fourth and fifth participants however, expressed a belief that freedom of speech should not be limited.  Despite this, the group was still able to come to a consensus.  After discussion, the group found that everyone could agree that freedom of speech was important.  As the first two participants had expressed that freedom of speech should be limited in the case of causing harm, the group came to the conclusion that, if one’s speech has the potential to cause unnecessary harm, then it should be limited.  As such, a compromise was reached between the two opinions.  The group came to a consensus view that freedom of speech is very important, but that it should be limited if one’s speech has the potential to cause unnecessary harm.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, freedom of speech is something that is a fundamental right in any civilised society. In many circumstances however there are cases where some freedom of speech can cause direct harm to others and this is where we feel that there are cases where this freedom should be limited.  It is reasonable to suggest that we should all be able to have freedom of speech and this should be protected and promoted however, at the same time we all should be respectful and there is a line where freedom of speech can cause harm to others and that is where we feel that there should be limits on freedom of speech. This shows how through discussion and debate we are able to come to a common understanding of a concept even though we may all have had very different initial viewpoints.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There are limits to freedom of speech when ones speech has the potential to cause another person unnecessary harm. Freedom of speech should be within the bounds of a respectful society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be freedom of speech in all instances. However people should not be permitted to incite hate or violence. In the face of the world in which we currently live there needs to be a more liberal attitude towards freedom of speech. The safety of a country lies in its ability to express ideas freely and openly.
