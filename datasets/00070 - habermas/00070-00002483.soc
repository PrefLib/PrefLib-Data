# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A person's life savings should be protected when their pension is being taken away. This is due to the fact that their life savings have already been taxed and it would be unfair for the government to take away more money from the family. It is also due to the fact that this could have large distorting effects on the economy, as it could reduce the incentive to save in the first place. This is also due to the fact that this could affect someone's quality of life and their family's quality of life. It would be unfair for the government to take away someone's life savings, as this could affect their family's future generations. This is also due to the fact that the person has worked their whole lives and paid tax and national insurance, and it would be unfair for the government to take away their life savings.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: A person's life savings should be protected when their pension is being taken away. The life savings that a person has accrued over the course of their life is theirs to do with as they please. It is not the government's place to interfere with a person's life savings, and the government should not be able to take away a person's life savings, especially if their pension is being taken away. This is an example of double taxation, and this is unfair to the family and the person, and their life savings were already taxed heavily. If their pension is taken away, then whatever money they have accrued should not be affected. This is also due to the fact that this affects someone's incentive to save in the first place. A lot of people opt to save money as it will help their family and future generations in the future, and destroying the incentive to save by taking away life savings could have large distorting effects on the economy. Reduced saving may could issues for investment and while it could stimulate demand in the short run, it is not fair for families to be denied the work of someone they cared for deeply, as opposed to their life savings being affected by the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, a person's life savings should be protected when their pension is being taken away. A person's life savings are a representation of their hard work, and taking this away would be detrimental to the individual, their family and the economy. The government should not get involved in a person's life savings, as this is an example of double taxation, which is unfair for the family and the person, and their life savings were already taxed heavily. If their pension is taken away, then whatever money they have accrued should not be affected. This is also due to the fact that this affects someone's incentive to save in the first place. A lot of people opt to save money as it will help their family and future generations in the future, and destroying the incentive to save by taking away life savings could have large distorting effects on the economy. Reduced saving may could issues for investment and while it could stimulate demand in the short run, it is not fair for families to be denied the work of someone they cared for deeply, as opposed to their life savings being affected by the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: A persons life savings should be protected when their pension is being taken away. This is because people have worked their whole lives to earn their life savings and it is unfair for the government to take that away.

If their pension is taken away, then whatever money they have accrued should not be affected. This is also due to the fact that this affects someone's incentive to save in the first place.
