# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that smoking is a serious health hazard and that employers should take action to encourage employees to quit smoking. The fact that employees are addicted to nicotine does not excuse them from the responsibilities they have towards others in the workplace. However, we recognise that the decision to stop smoking is a very personal one and not everyone can be expected to quit. We believe that those who smoke should be entitled to take short breaks away from their place of work to have a cigarette.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was against smoking on the job. Smoking on the job presents a bad image for the organisation and can be seen as unprofessional. Smoking can also be seen as a sign of addiction and should be discouraged. However, it was recognised that some people need to smoke to focus and concentrate on their work. Therefore, smoking on the job should be allowed but only in designated smoking areas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to smoking on the job. The group believed that smoking on the job is a bad habit and that people should be encouraged to quit. The group was of the opinion that smoking on the job can also lead to passive smoking and that this can have serious health consequences. The group also believed that smoking on the job can lead to a bad image for the company. However, the group did acknowledge that there are some circumstances in which smoking on the job is acceptable. The group believed that if a person is addicted to nicotine and needs a cigarette to concentrate on their work, then they should be allowed to smoke on the job. The group also believed that if a person is working alone and there is no one nearby to be affected by passive smoking, then they should be allowed to smoke on the job.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is not acceptable to smoke in any workplace. The health risks associated with smoking are too high.
