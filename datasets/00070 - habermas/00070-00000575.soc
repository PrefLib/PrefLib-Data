# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the government should not give out cash payments to all residents. We believe that by giving out cash payments the government is rewarding residents for doing nothing. The government should rather provide support for people who are actually trying to do something to improve their own lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus: The group felt that giving cash payments to residents would be a good idea if the money is being distributed to help out with the cost of living. However, it would not be a good idea if the money is given to residents to help bail out a big company that has made a big mistake.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group came to the consensus opinion that if it was decided that the government should give out cash payments to residents, that this should only be done as a one-off and should be equal to all. The participants also decided that it would be a good idea if residents were able to use the money for necessities such as food and clothing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the government should not give out cash payments to all residents but in special situations where the need to support residents is overwhelming, such as during a crisis, the government should provide cash payments to residents.
