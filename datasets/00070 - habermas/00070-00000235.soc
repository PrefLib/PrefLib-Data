# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is the opinion of the group that no-fly zones are a good idea to protect areas from noise and pollution, to reduce emissions from planes which are a huge contributor to global warming, to protect endangered areas and rain forests, and to prevent espionage over sensitive areas and the risk of terrorist attacks on significant locations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No fly zones would help to reduce pollution, protect military installations, natural areas and some sensitive government buildings.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the idea of 'no-fly' zones is a good one and should be implemented where appropriate to protect the environment, people and security. The idea of banning flights over areas of natural beauty and certain sensitive locations, such as military installations, is important and should be enacted. The issue of noise pollution should also be addressed as part of this and a wider solution, and we should also think about how we are to protect areas from the threat of terrorism.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be some no-fly zones, but not as many as you would think. There are a lot of different areas that would be safer for this, but it is also important to take into account that a lot of planes are very important for business, and for things like medicine. A good example of a good no-fly zone would be over very endangered areas of the rainforest. It is important to preserve nature, and so this is an important issue to consider.
