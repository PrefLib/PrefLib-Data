# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A universal basic income is a good idea as it would ensure that nobody was living in poverty. The idea of a minimum wage would be redundant if a universal basic income was introduced. People would still want to work and earn more money to be able to do the things that they want to do. The benefits system is unduly complicated and this could be entirely eliminated if universal basic income was introduced.
