# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the rise of social media has had a negative impact on society. The reason for this is that it has caused people to become more focused on being seen as popular or interesting as opposed to being genuine. This has led to people creating a false image of themselves on social media. This is unhealthy as people are not being true to themselves. It has also led to cyber bullying and trolling which has had a very negative impact on society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Social media has had both positive and negative impacts on society. The benefits of social media are that it makes it easier for people to connect with each other. This can be used for pre-existing groups and for new groups which can only be established through social media. The negative aspects of social media are that it has created an environment where people are more focused on being seen as popular or interesting as opposed to being genuine. Social media creates unwanted pressures on teenagers and children and has also caused a massive rise in "cyber bullying".
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There is no doubt that the rise of social media has had both positive and negative effects on society. However, the negative effects have been more pronounced. This is evidenced by the rise in depression and mental health issues among young people who are heavy social media users. The rise of social media has also led to the spread of fake news, which has in turn led to the election of populist leaders such as Trump and Brexit. Social media has also led to the creation of echo chambers where people only hear views which they already agree with, leading to a polarisation of society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the consensus view that the rise of social media has had a broadly negative impact on society. People have become more focused on being seen as popular or interesting as opposed to being genuine. Social media creates unwanted pressures on teenagers and children and has also caused a massive rise in "cyber bullying". I personally think social media is awful and was basically the beginning of the end when it comes to people being true to themselves.
