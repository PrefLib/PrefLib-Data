# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, people should not have to pay for their social care. If they have the money, then they should pay for it, otherwise the government should take money from the high-income earners and invest it into the provision of social care for those who need it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should not have to pay for their social care. It is unfair to expect someone who is in poor health to have to pay for their care, as this could cause stress that may worsen their condition. The government should take some of the money that goes to politicians, the royal family and the prime minister and invest it into providing social care for people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should not have to pay for their social care. No-one is guaranteed to live a long, illness-free life. To demand this of people is unrealistic and cruel, so we should not make it a requirement for people to pay for their social care.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should not have to pay for their social care. It is unfair to expect someone who is in poor health to have to pay for their care, as this could cause stress that may worsen their condition. The government should take some of the money that goes to politicians, the royal family and the prime minister and instead invest it into providing social care for people. The government should prioritise the welfare of the citizens it represents, and that includes social care.
