# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “I believe that NHS prescriptions should be free for all.  I believe this because people need to be able to go to their GP without worrying about the cost.  If they have to pay, they will not go and their health will worsen.  The NHS is there to help people and make them better.  If they have to pay, they will not get the help they need and will not get better.  If people are in work, they will be paying NI, therefore they should be able to get free prescriptions.  If they are not working, they will be claiming benefits and will be able to get free prescriptions.  I think it is unfair that some people have to pay and some do not.  It is not the patients fault if they are ill and they should not have to pay to get better.  I think the current system is good.  Free for those that are on benefits, free for those over 60, and the people in work have to pay.  If everyone had to pay, this would stop people going to the doctors for minor illnesses and put more pressure on the NHS.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: FINAL CONCLUSION: “We should not have to pay for NHS prescriptions for the following reasons: A study by the NHS in July showed that 1.6m prescriptions were not filled each year, and over the next few years, 121,000 deaths and 91,000 heart attacks could be avoided. It goes to show, that if people have to pay for their prescriptions, they will not be able to afford it and their health will go downhill. This means they will not be able to work and will not have to pay NI.  If they are on benefits, they are already paying for their prescriptions.  People need to be able to see their GP without worrying about the cost of the medication that they might need.  If we have to pay for our prescriptions, we will not go to the GP, no matter how ill we are and our health will deteriorate.  It is not fair that some have to pay and some do not.  It is not our fault that we are ill and if we are ill, we should be able to get better without worrying about costs.”
