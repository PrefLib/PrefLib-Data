# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the consensus opinion that we should not ban fast food restaurants from operating near schools, but we should make sure that children are well-informed about nutrition and healthy choices. We should make sure that these businesses include healthy food options and that these options are made prominently visible. We should also make sure that businesses actively promote nutritionally healthy options to children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We all agree that childhood obesity is a significant problem in the UK. While not one single factor may be to blame, it is clear that bad food choices play a key role in causing obesity and future health problems. Obesity also leads to reduced quality of life, meaning that it's crucial to find a way to combat it. While our opinions vary on whether banning fast food restaurants from operating near schools is the best way forward, we do agree that children should be educated about the health and long term implications of a poor diet. We also believe that making healthier food options readily available to children in schools is another important factor in fighting obesity. Therefore, our ultimate position is that fast food restaurants should not be banned from operating near schools, but more effort should go into educating children about the consequences of unhealthy eating habits and encouraging them to make healthier food choices. To aid this goal, we encourage everyone to take steps in improving their own nutritional education and making health food choices, as children will always model their behaviour on that of adults. This is the best way we can reduce obesity in our society, leading to a healthier, happier nation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should be educated about the importance of healthy eating. The health consequences of obesity in children should be made clear and the importance of making healthy food choices stressed. Fast food restaurants should not be banned from operating near schools. Instead, they should be encouraged to provide healthy food options, and to promote these options.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We agree that obesity in children is a big issue, and that the most common factor in child obesity is the amount of junk food that children eat. We all agree that a healthy diet for children is essential for them to grow into healthy adults, and that children need to be taught how to make good nutritional choices. We also agree that one of the biggest causes of children not eating healthy meals is the fact that fast food restaurants are all around, making it easy and convenient to get fast food instead of healthy meals. However, while we agree that banning fast food restaurants from operating near schools is a good idea, we feel that the focus should be on educating children about the long-term health implications of junk food, and to make healthier food options readily available to children. We also feel that the best way to tackle the problem is to educate parents and guardians on nutrition and healthy choices, and to make it easier for them to prepare healthy meals by providing them with recipes and nutritional information.
