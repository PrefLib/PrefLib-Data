# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - A basic income scheme would be beneficial for the country. It would ensure that everyone in the country receives a sufficient level of income to cover the costs of basic necessities. It would also narrow the gap between the rich and poor. However, the scheme would need to be carefully introduced and monitored. The amount of basic income should not be too high, otherwise it will remove all incentives to work. The basic income scheme should be there primarily as a means to combat food poverty and also help disadvantaged members of the population such as the disabled. It should exist to provide quality of life, not replace the need to work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A basic income scheme would be a positive thing. It would ensure everyone in the country (whether they are working or on benefits) receives a sufficient level of income to cover the costs of basic necessities. Further, a basic income scheme would narrow the gap between the rich and poor. It should be a legal obligation for the government and employers. At present, we have a minimum wage system in the UK but many employers flout the law and try to pay employees way below the legal amount. The sentences for breaking this law are too lenient.  The amount of basic income itself should the scheme go ahead, should however be carefully introduced and monitored. Too much of a basic income and it will remove all incentives to work.  The basic income scheme should be there primarily as a means to combat food poverty and also help disadvantaged members of the population such as the disabled. It should exist to provide quality of life, not replace the need to work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - A basic income scheme is a good idea but should be introduced carefully. It should be sufficient to meet basic needs and also provide an incentive to work. It should be legally binding and employers should be heavily fined if they are found to be paying below the basic income. The basic income scheme should be a legal obligation for the government and employers.
