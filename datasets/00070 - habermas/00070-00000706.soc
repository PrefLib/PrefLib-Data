# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we don't think students should be required to take these classes. We feel that university is the time for students to specialise in the subjects they are passionate about, and that they should not be forced to take classes in subjects that they may not be interested in or have the aptitude for. We do feel that it is important that all students have some basic knowledge and qualification in mathematics, science, and technology before they enter university, as this will be important in their future careers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, we don't think students should be required to take these classes. We feel that university is the time for students to specialise in the subjects they are passionate about, and that they should not be forced to take classes in subjects that they may not be interested in or have the aptitude for. However, universities should have basic entry requirements anyway, and students should be required to meet these basic requirements before being accepted into university.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Students should not be required to take classes in basic mathematics, science, and technology. These are not necessarily subjects that students will be interested in, and forcing them to take these classes could lead to a drop in the quality of their work and a drop in their grades. Students should be able to choose the subjects that they want to study, and this is especially important for subjects such as mathematics, science, and technology, which are not required for all career paths.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Students should be required to take classes in basic mathematics, science, and technology. This is because university is a time to broaden your horizons and learn about different things, not just specialise in the subjects you are passionate about. The skills you learn in these classes will be beneficial to you in your future careers, and the broadening of your knowledge and perspective will be beneficial to you in all areas of life.
