# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the costs of globalisation are outweighed by its benefits. We believe that by looking at the opportunities of globalisation we are able to provide a wider range of goods and services at a lower cost to consumers. This is one of the main benefits of globalisation. Globalisation also creates more opportunities for countries to trade with each other, which in turn can lead to economic growth and jobs. One of the major costs of globalisation is the impact on the environment. Globalisation is a big contributor to climate change. We believe that globalisation should go ahead, but the impact on the environment needs to be minimised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The costs of globalization are outweighed by the benefits as a result of economic growth and development and that there is little we can do to prevent it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There are more benefits to globalization that outweigh its cost. Globalization helps with economic growth, easy access to goods and services worldwide and also rapid increase of technology. All of this has helped immensely. There are few negatives we have to keep in mind though, with rapid increase in globalization the is a bigger impact on environmental damage, also massive job losses as firms are moving to cheap labour in return of increased profits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Globalisation has many benefits, but the costs are not outweighed by these benefits.
