# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should raise taxes on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service. The National Health Service is one of the most important services in the UK and it is struggling to provide the level of care it used to. This is a result of underfunding and the government has not done enough to support it. The NHS is a vital service that benefits everyone in the country, and it is only fair that those who can afford to pay a little more do so. The people who earn over $200,000 will barely notice the extra tax as their income is so high, and it will help to support the NHS. The NHS is an important service that is struggling to provide the level of care it used to, and it needs as much help as it can get. This is a temporary solution to a growing problem, and the government should do more to support the NHS. This is something that should be implemented immediately and then be reverted as soon as possible.
