# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the use of private jets should be discouraged as they are contributing to pollution. However, their use is necessary in some cases and there is a need to be able to transport people quickly in emergency situations. Therefore, a ban is not appropriate, but there is a need to limit the use of private jets to only when necessary. This may be done by making it more expensive to use a private jet, by increasing taxes on private jet owners, and by making it mandatory for private jet owners to offset the emissions of their flights.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the use of private jets should be banned as they are an unnecessary luxury and do not contribute to the greater good of society. The use of private jets should be permitted in emergency situations only.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Private jets should be banned for all but those who contribute to the common good. This includes high profile politicians and emergency workers. All other users should be banned from the private jet service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While the total ban of private jets is not supported by the group, some measures should be put in place to limit their use, especially where frivolous and decadent. A consensus view is that they should be used for emergencies only, and the use of private jets by the wealthy and the general public should be heavily restricted or banned. It is understood that there are some practical applications of the use of private jets but these should be limited to genuine emergencies and their use in such circumstances should be limited. For example, for transporting sick people who need immediate medical attention. Their use for the transport of the general public should be limited to specific and restricted circumstances, for example where the travel is longer than 6 hours and transporting more than 10 people. Their use for anything other than this should be prohibited, and those using them for such purposes should be subject to financial penalties.
