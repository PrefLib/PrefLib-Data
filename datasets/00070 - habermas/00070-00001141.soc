# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group came to the consensus view that if the UK had a nationalised pharmaceutical industry, then the NHS would be improved. This was because:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Nationalising the pharmaceutical industry would be a good idea. It would mean that the NHS would be able to focus on the more important issues and not have to worry about the price of medicine. We think that it would be a good idea to have a nationalised pharmaceutical industry because it would mean that the NHS would not have to worry about the price of medicine. This would mean that they could focus on other important issues and not have to worry about the price of medicine.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “We agree that the NHS would be improved if the UK had a nationalised pharmaceutical industry. This would reduce the price of prescription drugs, allowing the NHS to fund itself better and spend money on other sectors. However, it could have drawbacks, especially if a non-generic drug was not easily synthesised and only available through other manufacturers. In this case, people would be worse off for some conditions in the UK. We feel that a hybrid system should be implemented, where the UK had a nationalised generics industry, and a free market in non-generics. This would maintain competition and innovation in the pharmaceutical industry.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the NHS would be improved if the UK had a nationalised pharmaceutical industry.  This is because, in general, the prices of medicines would be lower, and the NHS would not be reliant on pharmaceutical companies to provide medicines.  However, it is also important to consider that the UK does not have the capacity to produce all medicines, and some medicines are only available from private companies.  Therefore, it is important to have a hybrid system, where the UK has a nationalised generics industry, but also has a private sector to provide medicines that cannot be produced in the UK.
