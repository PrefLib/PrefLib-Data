# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Public transport fares should not be increased and we should not use the extra revenue to provide free public transport for certain people. There are already other means of subsidising public transport and providing free transport for certain people who need it, such as free travel passes. The burden of paying for the public transport system should not be placed upon the users of the system.

We think that the burden of paying for the public transport system should not be placed upon the users of the system. There are already other means of subsidising public transport and providing free transport for certain people who need it, such as free travel passes.
