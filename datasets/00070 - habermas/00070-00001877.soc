# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary for a company's board of directors to have the same demographic make-up as the company's average workforce.  We believe that it is more important to have people who are good at the job expected of them and will consider the views of any people of any demographic who work there.  We also feel that it is important to have a wide range of views in a boardroom as this will help the company to be more effective in its decision making.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a range of races, from a mix of backgrounds. Not all the same gender i think it should reflect the companys workforce
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The effectiveness of a board is its ability to make sound and effective decisions. In order to achieve this, board members must work collaboratively to find the best way forward. A board with members of differing backgrounds, both in terms of demographics and in terms of their experience and expertise, will have a more well-rounded perspective when considering options and will therefore be more likely to reach a solution which is effective. In addition, it is important that a board of directors reflect the diversity of the company's workforce as a whole.
