# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The majority of participants believed that it is appropriate for corporations to be liable for the crimes committed by their directors and employees. There is a great deal of variation in the circumstances under which this would be appropriate, including if the crimes were committed whilst in work and related to their work activity and the individual employees were also charged separately. It was noted that corporations have responsibilities to the public and to their own shareholders. Where there is a chance that by neglecting those responsibilities a corporation does harm then it should be prosecuted. It is a company's responsibility to put safeguards in place to make sure their employees cannot act in ways that cause serious harm. Employees and practises should have appropriate oversight and where this is not the case then the company itself should be liable. This is to allow for people who were caused harm to find financial solutions to make themselves whole.
