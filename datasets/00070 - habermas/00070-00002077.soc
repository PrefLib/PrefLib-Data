# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: While the concept of fairness is an emotive one, we recognise that some people may not be able to afford medical care. There is a danger that fairness becomes a concept applied as a blanket, but we think it is acceptable to treat certain people differently in this regard. For example, people on very low incomes, children, the elderly, the mentally ill or people with severe medical conditions should have the ability to access medical care. The above list is not exhaustive and we feel that society can provide health care for a broad range of people who are struggling to afford it. The concept of fairness does not require that every single person should be able to access free medical care, as long as certain groups of people who are vulnerable and/or less fortunate can. We do not believe this system to be unfair and we believe that society can afford to provide free medical care to those who need it.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be a fair system for access to free medical care. We recognise that certain people will be more vulnerable and need more support. The system should ensure that these people can access medical care. We do not believe it to be unfair that some people can access medical care and others cannot. There is a danger that the concept of fairness is applied as a blanket, but we think it is acceptable to treat certain people differently in this regard.
