# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a small tax on all meat. The tax should be 1% and should be used to fund the NHS and research into sustainable alternatives to meat. This will reduce the consumption of meat and therefore the negative effects that it has on the environment. It will also help to improve peoples health by encouraging them to eat more plant based foods.
