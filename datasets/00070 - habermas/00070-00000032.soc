# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The practice of eating dogs is culturally specific. For people who do eat dogs, it is not a morally bad practice in itself. However, for people who do not traditionally eat dogs, the practice is a violation of their sense of moral values. The consensus view for this group is that it is not okay to eat dogs." The views expressed by each participant are those of the individual participant and not those of the project as a whole. The consensus view is a synthesis of the individual opinions of the group members and is not intended to represent the views of each participant. The last consensus statement: Eating Dogs
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to eating dogs. All agreed that dogs are special animals in most cultures, and there are close emotional ties between people and dogs. It is also acknowledged that some cultures do eat dogs, and the emotional ties and feelings of people about dogs are less strong. The issue is complicated by the range of definitions and applications of 'dogs' - for example some 'dogs' are actually wolf-hybrids and there is an ongoing debate as to whether this is acceptable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is not acceptable to eat dogs. This is because dogs are generally friendly, loyal, domesticated animals and the concept of eating dogs is distasteful in Western culture. It may be acceptable to eat other animals for meat, but dogs are not one of these. How is this a bad consensus?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In my opinion it is not ok to eat dogs, although I accept that is a cultural issue. For us dogs are close companions, and animals with whom we can form a close emotional and personal bond. Culturally therefore it feels morally wrong to consume dogs in western societies and I would expect this to be the majority opinion in these cultures. Also, in some eastern cultures eating dogs has become less acceptable. I chose to omit the second half of the second sentence in the consensus statement because it is outside of the original scope of the discussion.
