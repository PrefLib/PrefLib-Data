# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the right to protest is an important part of a functioning democracy. In particular, the right to protest is important for minorities, who often do not have the same voice as the majority. There are some circumstances, however, where the government should be able to ban public protests. The first is if the protests are led by right-wing authoritarian groups, who can then spread hate to minority groups and create chaos, if not being overseen by the police. The second is if the protests itself poses a risk to the people involved - fire hazards, security hazards, the threat of terroristic actions and a possible stampede happening. The third is if the protests cause a significant disruption to the lives of ordinary people. For example, climate change protests have been known to block roads, preventing ambulances getting through and stopping people from getting to work (doing roles that may cause significant security or safety issues, if they were not in work).
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the right to protest is an important right that should be protected. However, there are some circumstances where the government should be able to ban public protests. The government should be able to ban public protests if the protests are led by right-wing authoritarian groups, who can then spread hate to minority groups and create chaos, if not being overseen by the police. Additionally, one other circumstance where the government should be able to ban public protests is if the protests itself poses a risk to the people involved - fire hazards, security hazards, the threat of terroristic actions and a possible stampede happening.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the right to protest is an essential part of a democratic society. However, there are some circumstances where the government should be able to ban public protests. The government should be able to ban protests when there is potential for them to cause harm or danger to others. For instance, when roads are closed due to climate protestors, this can prevent ambulances getting through and stop people from getting to work (doing roles that may cause significant security or safety issues, if they were not in work). Protests that cause this level of disruption to the general public are dangerous and reckless.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the right to protest is a fundamental right in any democracy. The right to protest is one of the ways in which citizens can hold their government accountable and also express their views on important societal issues. However, there are some circumstances in which the right to protest can be limited. The government should be able to ban public protests in circumstances where the protests are likely to harm the public, or are likely to harm the protesters themselves. For example, the government should be able to ban public protests that are likely to cause a stampede or cause a fire hazard. The government should also be able to ban public protests that are likely to harm the protesters themselves, such as protests that involve a large number of people being in a confined space without adequate ventilation. The government should also be able to ban protests that are likely to cause harm to the economy of the country.
