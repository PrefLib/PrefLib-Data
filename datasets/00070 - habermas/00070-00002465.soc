# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should be in favour of universal basic income. It would be a leveller and help address social exclusion and reduce reliance on the state and cut down on the number of people that have to turn to criminal / dangerous activities to make ends meet. It would also increase social mobility and lead to a more fair and equitable distribution of wealth, lifting children out of poverty. The only real concern would be that the high earners would not be willing to pay more tax. However, if the tax was only on the high earners then it should not be too much of a problem and would be a very small price to pay for the benefits that it would bring. The tax on the highest earners could be increased in small increments each year until it reached the desired amount.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of universal basic income, with a couple of caveats. It is generally agreed that the current minimum wage is too low and should be increased, although this may not be the best way to address the problem. The group was also in favour of increasing taxes on the highest earners to help fund a universal basic income, although it was pointed out that the highest earners may be able to avoid paying tax through tax havens or other loopholes. It was also noted that some countries have a form of basic income already, such as the Nordic countries, and these countries tend to have a higher happiness index than the UK. A debate was held on the question of whether we should be in favour of universal basic income. The opinions of the participants were quite varied. A consensus was reached that the current minimum wage is too low and should be increased, and taxes on the highest earners should be increased to help fund a universal basic income. The group also noted that some countries have a form of basic income already, and these countries tend to have a higher happiness index than the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “In principle, yes we should be in favour of universal basic income. It would be a leveller and help address social exclusion and reduce reliance on the state and cut down on the number of people that have to turn to criminal / dangerous activities to make ends meet. It would also increase social mobility and lead to a more fair and equitable distribution of wealth, lifting children out of poverty. However, it is not visible to aim. Each country has own advantages and disadvantages. Would be very hard if not impossible to try reaching basic income for every state in the world. We should try to reach this in the UK, however. It would be a massive difference to so many lives and take away the stresses that an abnormal amount of households face in the UK (one of the richest countries in the world) of just making ends meet and affording things like food. Universal basic income would only help the economy and the people flourish. The minimum wage is too low at the moment in my opinion and it should be increased by at least 20%. I believe in equality for all.“
