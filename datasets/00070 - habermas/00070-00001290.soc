# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The British government has a moral obligation to support international development. This is due to a position of privilege it currently experiences, which is in part due to a past of amoral and unethical means of expansion, such as the British Empire, which caused uncountable damage to some parts of the developing world. The British government should give back to countries that it impacted for its own growth and expansion. The British government should also contribute to research such as for vaccines i.e. coronavirus and climate change to ensure scientific advancement. It is a moral obligation to keep trying to improve things in the world and not just for our own country. The British government should support international development as we have many British people living and working all over the world and we need other countries to be happy to provide them with jobs and opportunities to develop and for our country to reciprocate this for the need of all of society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The British government has a moral obligation to support international development to help poorer countries improve their society and quality of life, but only if the finances of the country permit it. The government should prioritise spending on this after ensuring that the British people are being provided for in their everyday lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The British government does have a moral obligation to support international development. We are a relatively rich nation, even though we have a lot of poverty. We have a position of privilege in part due to a past of amoral and unethical means of expansion, such as the British Empire. We should give back to countries that we have impacted. The British government should contribute to international development, helping to support less fortunate countries, providing jobs and opportunities to develop, ensuring scientific advancement and improving things in the world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, the British government has a moral obligation to support international development. We have a long history of colonisation and exploitation of other countries and as such we have a responsibility to help those countries develop. The UK has a lot of expertise in many areas and can use this to help other countries. The UK is also a relatively wealthy country and can afford to help other countries. We also have a lot of people living and working in other countries and it is in our interests to ensure that those countries are stable and prosperous.
