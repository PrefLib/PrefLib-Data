# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of expanding Heathrow Airport. The benefits of this would be to increase capacity and allow more flights to be made. This would increase business and help the economy. However, the group was aware of the negative impact this would have on the local community and the environment. The group felt that the government should consider how to mitigate these negative impacts. In light of recent lockdown, which resulted in cleaner air, lower noise, and good publicity for online meeting systems, the group also thought that air travel capacity may not need to be expanded, and air travel may decline as a result of people recognising these benefits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There were two major groups of people who would be impacted by the decision to build a new runway at Heathrow Airport: those living near Heathrow, and all humans on planet Earth. From the first group, those near Heathrow would be impacted by noise and air pollution and could expect to see their property values drop if they lived near the airport. From the second group, there are implications on the health of all people living on Earth. While COVID has forced restrictions on air travel, business leaders want to expand airports in an attempt to support economies during recovery from the recession. There is concern that more frequent air travel for work will reintroduce us to pollution and the resultant diseases of pollution that COVID-reduced travel have managed to mostly avoid. In our discussion, the decision to build a new runway at Heathrow comes down to an existential decision as to what is of greater value: economics or environmental health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of expanding Heathrow Airport. The benefits of this would be to increase capacity and allow more flights to be made. This would increase business and help the economy. However, the group was aware of the negative impact this would have on the local community and the environment. The group felt that the government should consider how to mitigate these negative impacts. Furthermore, it is not clear that this is needed and an alternative option for adding capacity through allowing larger, more efficient planes to use Heathrow should be explored. The participants from outside the UK also needed to have an opportunity to vote, therefore the facilitator asked them separately whether they agreed with the consensus statement that had been reached. All voted yes, the final consensus view was recorded, and the exercise was closed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Expanding Heathrow Airport would help the economy and is important for business.  It is crucial, however, to be aware of the environmental impact. Government and business should be taking steps to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and the environment will take a serious hit with the increased usage. Our global responsibility and, in this context, our air quality is important. Along with these two aspects the inconvenience to residents living in the vicinity must not be ignored. The group, however, came to the agreement that, in order to get the most out of these last few years of large carbon dependency we should be looking into expanding airports, however in 10 to 20 years this will hopefully become a dated system which we are better than”
