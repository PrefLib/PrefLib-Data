# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although there should be a limiting factor when it comes to banning sweets in supermarkets, we don't think they should be banned. People should be able to choose freely whether to indulge in them or not. Instead, there should be programs in place to encourage and incite people to not consume/buy as many sweets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the sale of sweets should not be banned in supermarkets. However, we believe that some sort of regulation should be put in place. The way that sweets are marketed to children and adults alike, has a big impact on the level of obesity in the UK. This is due to the fact that they are heavily marketed towards children and many of them have such bright and colourful packaging. Also, the fact that sweets are placed at the ends of aisles, means that many shoppers will not be able to walk past without buying a pack. With the help of the calorie information on the front of the packaging, we believe that people should be given the choice as to whether they buy them or not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of not banning the sale of sweets in supermarkets. The group felt that it was important for people to be able to make their own choices, however there was a strong feeling that the sale of sweets should be more tightly regulated. The group felt that there should be a limit on the amount of sweets that can be sold, and that this limit should be set by the government. The group also felt that sweets should not be sold in the same aisles as other food items, and that they should be kept in a separate section of the supermarket. The group also felt that the sale of sweets should not be marketed towards children, and that sweets should not be placed at children's eye level in supermarkets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although we do not believe that the sale of sweets should be banned in supermarkets, we do believe that there should be some level of regulation. There is a growing concern around the health of our nation, and the sale of sweets is a contributing factor to this. The fact that they are so readily available to purchase, and that they are often marketed to children is a cause for concern. We believe that the best way to combat this would be to limit the amount of sweets that can be purchased at any one time, and to also limit the amount of sweets that can be purchased for children. We believe that this would be the best way to combat the issue of obesity in our country, and to also allow people to still have the choice to purchase and consume sweets, but in a more regulated way.
