# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to hunting for sport. The main argument presented was that it is a cruel and unnecessary practice. It was also argued that hunting for sport is a practice that is no longer required for human survival, and so has no place in modern society. The group acknowledged that hunting for sport can be an important part of some cultures, but argued that this is no excuse for the practice to continue in other cultures. The group was also opposed to trophy hunting, and in particular the hunting of endangered species. Trophy hunting was described by the group as "morally corrupt" and "evil". The group also argued that hunting for sport can cause unnecessary suffering for animals, and can also lead to a reduction in animal populations. The group was also opposed to hunting for sport on the grounds that it can be dangerous for other people and animals who are not the intended target. The group acknowledged that hunting for sport can provide some economic benefits to some communities, but argued that this is not a sufficient reason for the practice to continue. The group was also opposed to hunting for sport on the grounds that it can lead to a reduction in the genetic diversity of animal populations. The group also argued that hunting for sport can lead to a reduction in
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be tighter regulations on hunting. We believe that it is not acceptable to hunt endangered species. Hunting should be carried out only by trained professionals, working on a population control programme. In general, we oppose hunting for sport and believe that it is an outdated practice and is not compatible with our modern understanding of nature. However, we recognise that hunting is an integral part of the cultural heritage of some countries and that it may provide food for some people. We feel that hunting for sport should be discouraged and that in general the practice of hunting should be phased out. We feel that education programmes should be set up to inform people about the impact of hunting on animals and animal populations. We feel that it is important for people to be fully informed about the issues surrounding hunting and that the public should have access to more information about the impact of hunting on animal populations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Hunting for sport is not ok. It is a barbaric act and demonstrates an extreme lack of respect for other living beings. It is not a sign of a civilized society, and those who do it are acting against the betterment of humanity. Hunting for food is a little more acceptable, but we would encourage people to eat a plant-based diet instead. Hunting for food should be done humanely, and with respect for the life of the animal. Hunting for food should also be done in moderation, with the aim to take only what is needed and to leave the rest of the animal population to continue to thrive. Hunting for food should be done in a way that is sustainable for the future, and does not threaten the existence of the species being hunted. Hunting for food should not be done for sport. It should be done out of necessity and done in the most humane way possible. Hunting for food should be done in a way that minimizes the suffering of the animal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to hunting for sport. However, we recognised that hunting has been part of the human experience for a very long time and in some cultures it is a significant part of their cultural heritage. We were also mindful of the fact that hunting can provide food for people and that there is a strong tradition of this in some countries. We felt that if hunting is to continue it should be tightly regulated and that it should be made illegal to hunt endangered species. We also felt that the hunting of animals for their fur should be made illegal. We also felt that it was important to educate people about the issues surrounding hunting and that there should be more information available to the public about the impact of hunting on animal populations. We felt that there should be more regulation of the hunting industry and that some species should be protected from hunting, especially endangered species. We also felt that hunting for sport should be discouraged, especially in countries where there is no strong hunting tradition.
