# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should accept more workers from countries outside of the EU, but we should not exploit them and pay them less than workers from the EU. We should also not accept workers from outside of the EU if it means that workers from the EU will not be able to find work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The key issue is whether the UK should accept more workers from countries outside of the EU, and not whether to accept more workers from other EU countries. There is no right or wrong answer to this question and I think that ultimately, this is a political question and not one to be discussed here. It is not the role of the European Commission to make political decisions for member states. This decision has to be made on a case by case basis. For example, if the UK is in need of a certain skill set, and workers are only available from a certain country, then we should accept those workers into the country. However, this is only an issue if there is a shortage of workers available. If there are enough workers available in the UK then there is no need to bring in workers from other countries. If there is a decision to bring in workers from countries outside of the EU, we must ensure that we provide suitable training to workers here, so that we have the skill set available in the future. We must also look at conditions for workers and ensure that we are paying a fair wage to avoid a shortage in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the UK should accept more workers from countries outside of the EU. This is because the UK is a multicultural society and has always welcomed people from other countries. The UK has a tradition of employing foreigners in some areas, such as nursing, hospitality and agriculture, where there is a shortage of workers. In order to avoid shortages in these areas, the UK should accept workers from outside of the EU. However, we should not increase the number of foreigners going into other types of jobs where there is no shortage. The UK should also look at providing good quality training in this country, to ensure we have suitable workers available. The UK should also look at pay and conditions which may cause some jobs to be seen as less favourable to people and result in us not being able to fill those roles. The UK should also assist people that are on long-term sickness and help them back to work, with support and guidance, so that we have a larger workforce.
