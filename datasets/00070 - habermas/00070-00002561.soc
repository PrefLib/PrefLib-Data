# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think that sounds like a nice idea, But the Phone and mail was the pinnacle of communication not so long ago and that wasn't expected to be free. Or libraries where we used to learn thing's. Plus if the state provides it, you can kiss goodbye to cutting edge advancement. Pure capitalism pushes' industries on . Having said that i do believe perhaps sections of society should be entitled to access through maybe some type of subsidy to help with costs
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: no as broadband isn't that expensive and doesn't cost a lot of money.  most people can easily afford broadband and if the state paid for it would only increase the burden on the national debt and increased taxes to pay for it
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, absolutely.  There are poor families who could start earning money online and having free broadband could help with their children's education.  This could make a huge difference to their lives.  From my own perspective, I was able to complete a degree entirely online for a much lower cost.  This is something that should be more accessible to the poor and it could also benefit the country as a whole because it may mean fewer people on benefits who are able to support themselves using the internet as leverage. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although it would have been a good service for the state to provide free broadband access to all its citizens but I don't think that should be done. the cost of free broadband access would so much that the economic implication would have a ripple effect in other facets of the economy. Such a service may lead the country into enormous debt that the benefits of free broadband access will not be able to compensate for. Government should rather redirect allocations for such benefits into other sectors like affordable healthcare and education for all citizens.
