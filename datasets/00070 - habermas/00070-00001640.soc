# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should cut its military spending to devote more money to domestic priorities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of cutting military spending to devote more money to domestic priorities. The group was in favour of this because they felt that there are many domestic priorities that are left neglected and this effects many people. The group was in favour of this because they felt that the UK should cut military spending. The group was in favour of this because they felt that we have absolutely no business being involved in the conflicts that we are. Especially when that funding could be used to better the quality of life for our own country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK should cut military spending to devote more money to domestic priorities. Many of our priorities such as health care, the environment, the police and education are currently neglected and deserve to be supported more. We believe that investing more money into the military is not a good use of funds as the UK does not have an active conflict and is not involved in any on-going wars. It is unlikely that any conflict would suddenly arise in the near future. Therefore, the money could be put to better use in improving the welfare of the people in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the UK should cut its military spending to devote more money to domestic priorities. However, the UK should maintain a minimum level of military spending to ensure that it can defend itself from any potential threats.
