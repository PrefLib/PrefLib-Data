# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children should be offered a vegetarian diet at school, but not forced to eat it. The issue of cultural identity and how this can be affected by a one-size-fits-all approach to school meals was raised, and participants felt that this should be taken into account. It was felt that the issue of climate change and how we as a society can minimise our impact on the environment is important, but that this should not be forced on to children. The issue of neurodiversity and the fact that children have different dietary requirements was also raised, and it was felt that this should be taken into account. It was felt that children should be given the option of a vegetarian diet at school, but that they should not be forced to eat it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We are all concerned about the environment and the impact of meat production on climate change. However, we don't feel that mandating vegetarianism is the right way forward. We feel it would be better to encourage schools to offer some vegetarian options and reduce the amount of meat in school meals, but still offer the option of eating meat. There may be some cultural or health reasons why some students may be unable to follow a vegetarian diet, and we don't want to force children to eat something they don't want to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should have the option of choosing a vegetarian diet if they so wish, but they should also be able to choose to eat meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children should be offered a vegetarian option in school. Children should not be forced to become vegetarian. A second group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
