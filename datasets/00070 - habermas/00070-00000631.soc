# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of a ban on non-essential plastics. There was some debate as to what constituted non-essential plastic, and what the consequences of a ban might be.  However, it was felt that the damage to the environment was a far greater concern.  The group was aware that many plastics are recyclable, and that this should be encouraged, but that a ban on non-essential plastics would be a good first step.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There is no doubt that plastic is a major cause of environmental pollution.  Whilst some plastic is necessary, there is no reason to use plastic where it is unnecessary or non-essential.  Therefore, to ensure that people/companies are taking responsibility non-essential plastics should be banned.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of a ban on non-essential plastics.  However, it was felt that the wording of the question was vague and needed to be more specific.  For example, what is meant by 'non-essential' and who would decide what was 'non-essential'?  The group thought that a better way to approach the issue would be to ban plastics that cannot be recycled.  This would be a more precise way to address the problem.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although there are many uses for plastic, it is not essential and has been proven to be very harmful to the environment and wildlife. Therefore, we should ban the sale of non-essential plastics.
