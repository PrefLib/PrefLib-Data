# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is a decline in free speech in the UK. People are now very careful of what they say to people. In the past, the world was not so politically correct and people said what they thought without fear of retribution. It is the norm to have a variety of opinions on a subject but nowadays people avoid expressing their views for fear of offending someone else. They censor themselves and we need to be more tolerant of people's views.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK is becoming less tolerant of free speech. It is very easy to upset people, especially online and so people are less likely to speak out and say what they feel. Some may even try to avoid controversial topics as they may lose friends or get attacked by strangers. Society is becoming too politically correct and so people are scared of saying things that may seem a little bit extreme, even though it is their right to express their views and opinions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK is becoming less tolerant of free speech. It is very easy to upset people, especially online and so people are less likely to speak out and say what they feel. Some may even try to avoid controversial topics as they may lose friends or get attacked by strangers. Society is becoming too politically correct and so people are scared of saying things that may seem a little bit extreme, even though it is their right to express their views and opinions. This means that people are scared to have their own opinions and so they may not feel the need to express themselves, which is an infringement on their freedom.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK is becoming less tolerant of free speech. It is very easy to upset people, especially online and so people are less likely to speak out and say what they feel. Some may even try to avoid controversial topics as they may lose friends or get attacked by strangers. Society is becoming too politically correct and so people are scared of saying things that may seem a little bit extreme, even though it is their right to express their views and opinions. We feel that it is a shame that society is becoming less tolerant of free speech and that the UK is becoming a less diverse place because of this.
