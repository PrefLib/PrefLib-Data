# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Penny Auctions: Two sides of the story. This article tries to take an objective view of both the customers and providers of Penny Auctions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Manchester United and Liverpool are the two most successful clubs in English football and their rivalry is one of the fiercest in world sport. Both have won 20 league titles and are the only two clubs in the history of the English football to have achieved this feat. Manchester United is the only team to win the Premier League three times in a row (1999/2000, 2000/2001 and 2001/2002) while Liverpool won it five times in a row. Liverpool is the most successful club in European football, having won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League six times while Manchester United has won it three times. On the other hand, Manchester United has more supporters in the world and they also have a more modern stadium. Although, their fans may not have been as consistent as Liverpool’s over the years, their attendance is higher and their support is greater. Overall, the two clubs are very similar in terms of their success and in terms of the amount of fans they have. It’s a hard one to call but I would have to say Manchester United are better. They are currently top of the Premier League so I would say they are the better team at the moment.
