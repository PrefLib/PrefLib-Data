# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I do not believe everyone should have access to this, however, this would be very helpful for people with lower incomes. This can help ensure children can afford clothing and food while they are studying in schools, people who aspire to develop their skills and career can have extra income to work towards that goal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: This is not some thing I have heard of before. I think to struggling families and individuals who do not qualify for other benefits like cost of living payments due to not qualifying for certain benefits then this would be invaluable. I do feel like it is a lot in general to give away and would question where the money is coming from and if this would affect some people negatively meaning is not beneficial getting the payments.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think we should use a basic income guarantee system, where all people in the UK receive at least £100 per month. I cannot see the downside to such a policy, especially considering the dire economic of the situation in the UK now. Some people may disagree with it because they believe it provides less of an incentive to work, but this sort of policy is necessary to decenter the role of labour and productivity in regards to peoples basic societal needs. Although, rather than this policy, it would naturally be better to have a higher minimum wage. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I am for the concept of a universal basic income. It's a great idea and is fairer than our current benefits system. In this specific case however, £100 per month isn't exactly going to change lives so I am not sure if I support this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: i think this is a good idea as it tops up peoples basic income and ensures that everyone can afford the necessities such as heating and food . It means people wouldnt have to ask for help as they are guaranteed this basic income to help them
