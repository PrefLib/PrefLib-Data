# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the average person does not need a car. There are many people who would benefit greatly from using public transport, walking or cycling instead. This would have many benefits, including reducing the amount of pollution in the air, the amount of congestion on the roads and would help people to keep fit. However, there are people who live in remote areas, or have mobility issues, or a combination of the two, who would find it difficult to get around without a car.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There are many situations in which the average person does not need a car. In general, the availability of public transport, the ability to walk and cycle, and the ability to share transport with others can often be used to replace the need for a car. However, for certain people in certain situations the need for a car can be justified. For example, people who live in rural areas, people who have certain medical conditions, or people who have a need to transport large or heavy objects.
