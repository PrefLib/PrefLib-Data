# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Theresa May was not a good prime minister, however she was possibly the best of a bad bunch. In her time in office, she was not able to demonstrate strong leadership, as a result she did not command the respect of her party. In addition, she was unable to campaign effectively or communicate her policies across to the electorate, which resulted in her party losing many votes. She was also not able to implement any effective policies to help the poor or disadvantaged members of society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Theresa May was not a good Prime Minister.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Theresa May was a terrible prime minister who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, Theresa May was not a good prime minister. She was not a good campaigner and did not inspire people. She was indecisive and did not have a clear plan. The Brexit deal she negotiated was not popular and was not supported by her own party. The conservative party did not really want her as a leader and this was reflected in the way they treated her. The conservative party has moved to the right since she was leader and this has not helped poor people in the UK.
