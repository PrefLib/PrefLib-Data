# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We generally agree with the idea of EV vehicles. However, to make it possible for the switch to EV to happen the first issue that we need to address is funding. Funding is needed to build the infrastructure of charging points across the country and funding is also needed to reduce the cost of the vehicles themselves. We also need to consider how to dispose of old petrol and diesel cars. Conclusion
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There are a number of issues that need to be addressed before a widespread switch to EV vehicles is possible. Firstly, the infrastructure for charging the vehicles needs to be in place and this will require a large amount of funding. Secondly, the cost of the vehicles themselves needs to come down as they are currently unaffordable to the majority of the population. Finally, the issue of what to do with the old petrol and diesel cars needs to be addressed as they cannot be simply thrown away. The challenge, however, is in knowing how to weigh these opinions against each other.  Should we just add up all of the votes for each answer and go with the most popular one? This, however, doesn’t take into account how confident people are in their answers. After all, is someone who is 100% sure that they are correct more correct than someone who is 90% sure that they are correct? Or, should we just go with the answer that most people agree on? This, however, could mean that the answer is the one that most people just happen to agree on, without really thinking about it, rather than the one that is actually correct. A number of scientists have tried to come up with a mathematical model for this
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of EV vehicles as they are better for the environment. However, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed before a widespread switch to EV vehicles is possible. Firstly, the infrastructure for charging the vehicles needs to be in place and this will require a large amount of funding. Secondly, the cost of the vehicles themselves needs to come down as they are currently unaffordable to the majority of the population. Finally, the issue of what to do with the old petrol and diesel cars needs to be addressed as they cannot be simply thrown away. This would require a well thought out plan to manage the scrapping of these old vehicles in a way that would have the least impact on the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general the group was in favour of EV vehicles as they are better for the environment. However, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed before a widespread switch to EV vehicles is possible. Firstly, the infrastructure for charging the vehicles needs to be in place and this will require a large amount of funding. Secondly, the cost of the vehicles themselves needs to come down as they are currently unaffordable to the majority of the population. Thirdly, the issue of what to do with the old petrol and diesel cars needs to be addressed as they cannot simply be thrown away. Finally, the impact on the electricity grid of the increased demand for electricity needs to be assessed. This may create new issues for the electricity system.
