# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It was agreed that the gun control laws should be made stricter, for many reasons. The amount of accidental deaths and mass shootings in the United States of America has shown that gun laws are failing. Many people were also in agreement that guns have no place in general society and they should be restricted to gun clubs. It was also agreed that many young people need to be better educated on the effects of gun crime and how to use a gun responsibly, so that they are fully aware of what they are doing and do not cause any harm to anybody.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of imposing stricter gun control laws. This was because of the increasing number of gun crimes in the country and the devastating effects of gun crime. The group was also in favour of educating young people and making it harder for them to get hold of a gun. The group also believed that the situation would get worse if the country did not take control of it now.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Gun crime is on the increase and we need to impose stricter gun control laws. Gun control laws should be reviewed and possibly implemented again as there are too many guns in circulation. The media has helped to increase awareness of gun crime and the devastating effects that it can have.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of stricter gun control laws. The participants felt that guns are dangerous and can cause a lot of damage and should be kept out of the hands of the general public. The participants felt that the US is a good example of what can happen when guns are too easily accessible. The participants also felt that there is a lot of gun crime in this country and that it is only a matter of time before something similar to the US happens here. The participants felt that there is a need for more education on gun safety and that young people need to be better educated on the dangers of guns. The participants also felt that it is very easy to obtain a gun and that there needs to be more checks on who is allowed to own a gun.
