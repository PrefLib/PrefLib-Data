# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, the group of participants believe that all government websites should be made accessible to the blind.  This is because it is the government’s responsibility to ensure that all members of society have equal access to information.  This is important as it ensures that all members of society are able to access the information that they require.  It is also important to ensure that people are not discriminated against because of a disability.  This is because it is ableist to exclude people from accessing information because of a disability.  The government is legally and ethically required to provide this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Consensus View: All government websites should be made accessible to the blind.  Websites contain a lot of important information that can be essential to have access to.  Not being able to have access to these websites is a problem because of how much they are used today.  Being able to have equal access to the websites is important because people will be able to gain important information and have a better understanding of what is going on in the government.  Also, not being able to have access to websites is ableist because it assumes that a blind person does not have the ability to use a computer and websites.  Making websites accessible to the blind will also not be expensive because it is already required by law that a website is accessible to people with disabilities.  It is important that we take steps to make sure that all people are able to use a website and get access to the information they need.
