# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Prostitution should be legal. The only argument I can see for its illegality is on the grounds of morality. In the 21st century we should not be judging individuals' personal lives and their choice of employment on the grounds of morality. The act itself does not hurt anyone, it is the fact that people are making a living out of it that causes some moral conflict. Aside from this there are many benefits to the legalisation of prostitution. It would protect the prostitutes themselves, and would stop women from feeling that they had no other option. Making the service illegal would not stop the demand, as it is a perfectly natural human instinct and there will always be demand.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of legalisation, though with conditions. We feel that as long as prostitution is legal, then both prostitutes and their clients should be treated as criminals and should be prosecuted. We feel that if prostitution is legalised then there should be help given to these women in the way of support, education, and a way out of the profession.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Prostitution should be legalised in order to allow it to be regulated, improve the quality of life for those involved, and reduce the number of illegal criminal rings that could operate and become dangerous to vulnerable individuals. The risks to prostitutes could be reduced, and they would also receive the support that they require.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Prostitution should not be legal. Legalising it makes it seem like a profession like any other, and we don't want to be encouraging young women to think that it is a viable option. We do think that there should be laws to protect these vulnerable women and help to keep them off the streets and away from the dangerous pimps.
