# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the principle of a UBI, but did not agree on the level at which it should be set.  It was felt that a level of income that would allow people to live a decent life would be good, but that it should not be so high as to discourage people from working.  There was also some debate about whether the UBI should be means tested, and this was a topic on which the group was unable to reach a consensus.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A universal basic income is a good idea as it would ensure that nobody was living in poverty. The idea of a minimum wage would be redundant if a universal basic income was introduced. People would still want to work and earn more money to be able to do the things that they want to do. The benefits system is unduly complicated and this could be entirely eliminated if universal basic income was introduced.
