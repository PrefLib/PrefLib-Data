# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People have the right to live their life as they wish to. If they wish to go out on a Sunday, then they should be allowed to buy alcohol from the supermarket. It is their choice and should not be restricted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes.  The argument against is a throwback to the days when Sunday was seen as the day of Christian worship, and that the sale and consumption of alcohol was discouraged.  As we live in a much more secular and diverse society, this viewpoint no longer holds much sway.  The majority of people should not be held back in their day to day activities for the sake of a small percentage of people with no self control.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes. The argument against is a throwback to the days when Sunday was seen as the day of Christian worship, and that the sale and consumption of alcohol was discouraged.  As we live in a much more secular and diverse society, this viewpoint no longer holds much sway.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing alcohol sales in supermarkets on Sundays.  This is because in the U.K. we have a diverse society, and the view of the majority should be respected.  The view that a Sunday should be a day of rest is a religious view, and is not appropriate in a multicultural society.  There is no reason why a Sunday should be treated any differently to any other day of the week.  We should not prohibit alcohol sales on a Sunday, and if there is a problem with alcohol consumption then this is down to the individual and their personal responsibility.
