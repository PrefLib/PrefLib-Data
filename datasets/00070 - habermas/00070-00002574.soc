# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think human-induced climate change is a serious problem. The advancing technology we have now means people live a much higher consumerist lifestyle and this is leading to overproduction of products and overusing resources in a way our planet is not designed for. Climate change will affect the poorest in our world first and by the time wealthier parts of the world feel the impact the issue will likely be very advanced. People cannot change this alone, governments need to lead the way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, very much so. It's been a problem for a while but we're only now realising how far in the hole we are and it may already be too late to reverse it but we can at least slow it down. There's a lot of good being done, but we still need to do more.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think that human induced climate change is a very serious problem because the consequences are very serious like ice caps melting, air pollution and extreme weather events. Humans are a big threat to our planet and everyone needs to try and be more environmentally friendly
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes it is. Humans need to find better ways to source things to reduce climate change. in addition, there needs to be policies brought in to help reduce climate change. this could be similar to the plastic bag levy etc. Small things can be done by people on a regular basis - this would be a start. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I think that human-induced climate change is a serious problem as we can see, particularly in more recent years, that terrible weather events and mass migrations are happening around the world because those places are no longer livable or are coming close to being unlivable. However, I do not think it is the only problem, as we know that the climate is heating up regardless of what we do, we are just driving it further on. As such, I think sometimes we need to think about whether we should be blaming people or instead be thinking about ways in which we can come to solutions together. Similarly, the planet will be just fine even if we 'destroy' it, so we have to think about why care about it - in reality, it is to protect ourselves, and so we should frame it in this manner.
