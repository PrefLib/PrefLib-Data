# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the process of becoming a member of parliament is not particularly difficult, but there are some aspects of it that are not ideal. There is a tendency for people to get selected on the basis of party political considerations rather than competence, and this should be discouraged. The process could also be made more accessible to people from a wider range of backgrounds, including people who have not previously been involved in politics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I don't think it is particularly hard or easy to become an MP, but the criteria for selection are not necessarily the best ones to ensure that we have good MPs. I think there should be a more formal process for assessing candidates, including perhaps an interview or some kind of formal assessment of ability and competence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is not clear that it should be made easier to become an MP, although there are certainly more people who could do the job and who would like to do the job than those who actually do it. It would be better if political parties were more honest about the selection process, and the criteria for selection.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of making it easier to become a member of parliament. However, the group also recognised that this is not as simple as it sounds. The current system is not working, but it is not clear that making it easier to become an MP would necessarily lead to a better outcome.
