# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a minimum price for alcohol. This should be set so as not to price people out of alcohol. The minimum price should be used to fund the health service as it will be dealing with an increase in alcohol related health problems.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group felt a minimum price for alcohol would be a good thing, however, it should not be so high as to price people out of alcohol consumption. The group wanted to see a minimum price as it would reduce the amount of alcohol consumed, but did not want to price people out of alcohol. The group also felt the minimum price should be used to fund the health service, as the health service would be dealing with the increased number of alcohol related health problems, and the mental health implications from alcohol consumption. Discussion While a single paragraph in length, this example of C-BRiSK activity was not as easy as it seems. Each participant used iCope in turn to provide their opinion on a minimum price for alcohol. However, instead of being single individuals each participant would have represented a stakeholder group with an interest in the topic, so that the development of a consensus would actually represent the consensus of a range of stakeholders.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group was in general in favour of a minimum price for alcohol. The group felt that a minimum price for alcohol would be a step in the right direction for the health of Britains. However, they were not in favour of a very high minimum price, as this could price some people out of the alcohol market, which would not be ideal.The group felt that the minimum price of alcohol would not have a great impact on the average drinker, however, it would make an impact on the heavy drinker. The funding from the minimum price of alcohol would be used to increase the funding for the health service, as the health service would be dealing with more alcohol related health problems. However, the group did feel that this increased funding for the health service should be focused more on mental health rather than the NHS in general, as there is more of a growing need for mental health provisions than for general health provisions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of a minimum price for alcohol, however, the minimum price should not be so high as to price people out of alcohol consumption. The group was in favour of a minimum price as it would reduce the amount of alcohol consumed, and would therefore reduce the amount of alcohol related health problems. However, the group did not want to price people out of alcohol as it is a social drug and can be an important part of the community. The group also felt that the minimum price should be used to fund the health service, as the health service would be dealing with the increased number of alcohol related health problems. However, the group felt that the health service would also need to be prepared to deal with increased mental health problems that would be associated with alcohol consumption.
