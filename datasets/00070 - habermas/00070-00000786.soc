# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, the group have decided that voting should not be compulsory in local elections. The reason for this is because voting is a choice and should be left up to the individual. However, it would be beneficial for people to vote as it would give them a voice and allow them to have their say on what happens in their local area. The group also think that the local elections are not as important as the general elections, therefore it is not as crucial for people to vote in them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, the group has decided that voting should not be compulsory in local elections. This is because people have the right to vote for who they want and if they do not want to vote they should not have to. If people are forced to vote, they may end up voting for the wrong person and this could have a negative impact on their local area.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of compulsory voting in local elections.

However, the group was in favour of encouraging people to vote, and also to educate themselves on the political process.
