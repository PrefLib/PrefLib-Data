# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although the richest people in the UK are already taxed more than the poorest, we think it would be a good idea to tax them even more. We think that the richest people have more money than they could ever need, and by taxing them more, this money could be used to help the poorest people in the UK. We also think that taxing the richest people would be a good idea as they often earn their money by exploiting the poorest people. This means that the poorest people are often left with very little money, and we think that this is not fair. We also think that by taxing the richest people, we will have more money to improve the country's infrastructure and welfare services. The richest people will still be wealthy after this, but we think that some of their wealth would be better used if it was taken as taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I think it would be a good idea to tax the richest people in the UK. The richest people have a lot more money than everyone else and therefore can afford to pay more tax. They often make their money by exploiting poorer people which means that these poorer people are often left with very little money. This is not fair, so I think it would be a good idea to tax the richest people more, so that this money can be used to help the poorest people in the UK. We could also use the money to improve the country's infrastructure and welfare services.  The richest people will still be wealthy after this, but some of their wealth would be better used if it was taken as taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although the richest people in the UK are already taxed more than the poorest, I think it would be a good idea to tax them even more. The richest people have more money than they could ever need, and by taxing them more, this money could be used to help the poorest people in the UK.  We also think that taxing the richest people would be a good idea as they often earn their money by exploiting the poorest people. This means that the poorest people are often left with very little money, and we think that this is not fair. By taxing the richest people, we will have more money to improve the country's infrastructure and welfare services. The richest people will still be wealthy after this, but we think that some of their wealth would be better used if it was taken as taxes.  Although not everyone in the group agreed fully with every word of the statement, they all agreed that this represented the overall group's opinion as accurately as possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have all agreed that taxing the richest people in the UK would be a good idea.  We all think that the richest people have more money than they could ever need, and by taxing them more, this money could be used to help the poorest people in the UK. We think that taxing the richest people would also be a good idea because many of the richest people get their wealth by exploiting the poorest people, and this means that the poorest people are often left with very little money, and we think that this is not fair. If the richest people in the UK were taxed even more than they are now, we would have more money to improve the country's infrastructure and welfare services. The richest people will still be wealthy after this, but we think that some of their wealth would be better used if it was taken as taxes.  The only participant who did not fully agree was the 5th, but we were all able to convince this participant that our view is the correct one.
