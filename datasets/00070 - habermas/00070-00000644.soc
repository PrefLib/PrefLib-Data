# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Non-essential plastics should be banned from supermarkets. If it is not essential, it should be replaced by an alternative, preferably a natural alternative. Supermarkets should remove all plastic bags and replace them with paper bags. Customers should be able to purchase Jute bags if they have forgotten to bring their own bags. Plastic bottles are essential, but they should be refillable.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “Non-essential plastics should be banned from supermarkets. If it is not essential, it should be replaced by an alternative, preferably a natural alternative. Some plastics, such as plastic bottles, are essential and should be recycled properly. We also suggest that supermarkets should provide an incentive for customers to bring their own shopping bags, for example by giving a discount for customers who bring their own bags.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Supermarkets should be encouraged to use alternatives to plastics in their packaging, where possible. They should also be encouraged to use biodegradable plastics in packaging where necessary. This would reduce the impact on the environment. They should also be encouraged to use return schemes for plastics such as milk bottles and water bottles to increase the lifespan of the plastic. This would reduce the impact on the environment.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Non-essential plastics should be banned from supermarkets. If it is not essential, it should be replaced by an alternative, preferably a natural alternative. Plastic bottles should not be banned but they should be collected and recycled responsibly. The use of paper bags should be encouraged and supermarkets should provide taps where customers can bring their own reusable containers to collect liquids such as milk and water. Supermarkets should also provide a cow feature where customers can milk it themselves.”
