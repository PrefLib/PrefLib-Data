# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government is not doing enough to protect our privacy. The government doesn't seem to be doing much to protect our privacy. The problem is that we don't know what they are doing to help the situation. There have been many recent leaks of our data and they don't seem to be doing anything to punish those who leak our information. The government needs to do more to try and protect our data. They need to do more to try and prevent the leaks of our data. Conclusion: After the deliberation and revision of the group view, the group came to a consensus on the topic. It is a well-written view that covers all of the points that were made and takes into account all of the opinions of the participants.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government are not doing enough to protect our privacy. It's very difficult to find out what they are actually doing to protect our privacy, so it's hard to give them a full endorsement. The amount of leaks that have occurred from the government is worrying and doesn't fill you with much confidence. Furthermore, it is also very hard to see how the government are protecting our privacy when so much of our information is leaked every day, even from the most well-protected companies in the world. The government should do more to try and tackle the problem of leaked data, as the risk of losing information such as bank details, address, and phone number is becoming increasingly likely. The government should also do more to make sure that the people who are leaking our data are punished in some way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government are not doing enough to protect our privacy. It is extremely difficult to find out what they are currently doing, so it's hard to give them a full endorsement. They seem to try and tackle the problem of leaked data but this is a big problem and I feel more needs to be done. Furthermore, it is also very hard to see how the government are protecting our privacy when so much of our information is leaked every day, even from the most well-protected companies in the world. A criticism of the system was also proposed: The participants saw the problem as being extremely large and complex, and that the system might have been too focused on certain areas of the privacy sector. A suggestion was made to develop a system that is more focussed on the comparison between countries. The government does seem to not be as active in areas like US as they are in European countries.  There is an open task for future research to generate a system such as this.
