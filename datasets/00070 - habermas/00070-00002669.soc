# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “In general, the group was in favour of free childcare. The group felt that the childcare should be free from a few months old as it is important for the child to bond with the parents at the beginning. The group felt that the childcare should be free to allow parents to get back to work and also create jobs for those whom look after the children. The group felt that it is important for the economy for parents to get back to work after having a child. The group felt that it would get parents back to work and also create jobs for those whom look after the children. The group felt that child costs are extortionate and the UK is one of the most expensive childcare systems in the world. The group felt that not only does getting a parent back to work help them emotionally, it is also a good example for a child to see this daily routine.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “I believe that the government should provide free childcare to all parents from the age of 2. It is very expensive for parents to pay for childcare and the government should help out. The government should also help with the costs of childcare for parents who have a low income. It is very important for children to be in a good childcare setting as this is where they learn and develop.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “The government should provide universal free childcare for all children aged between 2 and 5 years old. The government should also heavily subsidise childcare for children aged between birth and 2 years old. This will allow parents to get back to work and contribute to the economy and also allow their children to be cared for in a safe and stimulating environment. This will also create jobs for those whom look after the children.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The government should provide free childcare to all children from birth, but with the option for parents to choose whether to take it up or not.  This would help parents get back to work, create jobs for those looking after the children, and also reduce the cost of living for families.  However, the government should also heavily subsidise childcare to make it more affordable for all.”
