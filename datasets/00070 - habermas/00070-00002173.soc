# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We think children should be taught about both the achievements of past civilizations and the modern society. We think that it is important to learn about the achievements of the past civilizations as they are the foundation on which modern society was built. In addition, there were certain aspects of the past that we can learn from and avoid. However, we also think that learning about the modern society is just as important. By learning about the modern society we can develop the future world, and teaching about sociology can create a mindset that prioritises equality. Overall, children should be taught about both the past and the present.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children should be taught more about the achievements of past civilizations and less about modern society. The past has shaped our future and we should be grateful for the opportunities we have. The world is a very different place now and we need to teach children to be grateful for what they have.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should be taught more about the achievements of past civilizations and less about modern society because we can use the successes and failures of the past to help build a better future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a balance between teaching about the past and teaching about the present. We should highlight both the positives and negatives of the past. The past has shaped our present and will continue to shape our future. The past has a lot to teach us, but we should not dwell on it. We should also teach children about modern society to help them understand the present and prepare them for the future.
