# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, unhealthy food advertising is something that should be limited. The way we can tell what is unhealthy and what is healthy needs to be clarified so that we can know exactly what we are dealing with. However, I do believe that we need to be careful about banning all unhealthy food advertising as some people may not know the difference between healthy and unhealthy foods and this could cause more problems than it solves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “Unhealthy food is everywhere, but it is not always advertised. It would be difficult to regulate and we don’t want to be a ‘nanny state’. We are in favour of people having choice, but we should protect our children from advertisements which are designed to make unhealthy food attractive. The only way to protect children is to ban advertising on children’s TV and perhaps in children’s magazines. We do not believe that advertising to adults should be banned, as people are able to make up their own minds about what is healthy and what is not. We feel that the Government should invest in advertising campaigns to encourage people to eat healthily, but we feel that these would be more effective if they used famous athletes and celebrities to promote the idea of healthy eating. However, we believe that the Government should not spend tax payers money on adverts which promote any particular product.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Advertising of unhealthy foods should be restricted.  Adverts aimed at children should be more strictly controlled, but adults should be allowed to make their own decisions.  It is important to find a balance between advertising of unhealthy foods and freedom of choice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be some restriction on unhealthy foods, but not all of them.  Advertising is too general a concept.  Instead, the government should look at what types of food to restrict and which to allow.  This should be based on a consensus of experts and then the government should implement the restrictions.
