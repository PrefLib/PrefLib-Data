# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we don't believe the NHS should be scrapped.  The NHS is a fantastic system that has served us well.  However, we believe the tax system may need to be changed in order to boost funding.  We believe health care should be available to all and not based on your ability to pay for it.  We believe the NHS should embrace the private sector to reduce waiting lists.  We believe there needs to be significant structural changes.  We believe NHS England should be disbanded and regional health organisations implemented.  We believe funding should be directed from NHS England and similar organisations and directed to frontline healthcare services.  We believe mental health services should be completely separate from other NHS services, so the allocation of funding is clear.  We believe, in general, that the current state of the NHS is due to a lack of funding.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final consensus statement: We don't believe the NHS should be scrapped.  We believe the NHS is a fantastic system that has served us well.  However, we believe the UK's tax system can be modernised to boost the funding available for the NHS. We believe it is important to allow the private sector to flourish alongside the NHS in order to increase capacity and reduce waiting times.  We believe there needs to be significant structural changes.  We believe NHS England should be disbanded and regional health organisations implemented.  We believe funding should be directed from NHS England and similar organisations and directed to frontline healthcare services.  We believe mental health services should be completely separate from other NHS services, so the allocation of funding is clear.  We believe the current healthcare system works well for the UK overall but funding can and should be improved in order to increase patient outcomes, especially in the instance of oncology care and access to new medications.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe the NHS is a fantastic system and we wouldn't wish to see it go. We believe it should be funded by the tax system. However we believe NHS England and similar organisations should be disbanded. Funding should be directed from NHS England and similar organisations and directed to frontline healthcare services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We don't believe the NHS should be scrapped.  We believe the NHS is a fantastic system that has served us well.  We believe the NHS should be funded by the tax system.  We believe the tax system may need to be changed in order to boost funding.  We believe health care should be available to all and not based on your ability to pay for it.  We believe the NHS should embrace the private sector to reduce waiting lists.  We believe there needs to be significant structural changes.  We believe NHS England should be disbanded and regional health organisations implemented.  We believe funding should be directed from NHS England and similar organisations and directed to frontline healthcare services.  We believe mental health services should be completely separate from other NHS services, so the allocation of funding is clear.  We believe more funding should be available for new modern medicines that have very high success rates but are not offered on the NHS due to cost.
