# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of restrictions on the sale of sugary drinks. However, it was felt that the issue is more complex than it first appears. The group was in favour of a sugar tax, which would increase the price of sugary drinks, making them less attractive to consumers. The group was also in favour of a ban on the sale of sugary drinks in schools. However, it was felt that a total ban on the sale of sugary drinks would be difficult to define and would be difficult to enforce. The group also felt that it would be difficult to define what a sugary drink is, and that drinks such as fruit juice and milkshakes would also need to be included in any ban. The group felt that the issue is more complex than it first appears and that a total ban on the sale of sugary drinks would be difficult to define and would be difficult to enforce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: While sugary drinks should be restricted, this can be achieved without imposing a total ban on the sale of sugary drinks. A tax on sugary drinks and a ban on sugary drinks in schools could help reduce obesity, while a total ban on sugary drinks would be difficult to enforce and would be hard to define, as what constitutes a sugary drink would be hard to identify. However, sugary drinks which also have a large amount of caffeine (such as energy drinks) should also be restricted, as the high levels of caffeine pose a separate health risk.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a sugar tax on sugary drinks. The revenue raised from the tax should be used to improve dental health, to reduce the cost of dental treatment, and to improve dental education. A ban should be introduced on the sale of sugary drinks in schools. The Government should consider the possibility of introducing restrictions on the advertising of sugary drinks. It would be difficult to enforce a total ban on the sale of sugary drinks, and it would be difficult to define what a sugary drink is. However, it should be made clear that sugary drinks can have a detrimental effect on health and that children should drink water or milk instead.
