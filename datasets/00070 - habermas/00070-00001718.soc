# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the gender pay gap should be disclosed by all UK companies with more than 250 employees. This is because we believe that it is unfair that some employees are paid less than others for doing the same job. The information should be made public, so that people can make informed decisions about the companies they work for. It is also important that companies with less than 250 employees also disclose their gender pay gap. This is because it is important that all employees are paid the same for doing the same job no matter their gender.

The group felt this was an improvement on the original statement, and all parties were happy with the final consensus reached. During the Critical Inquiry sessions, the opinions expressed by the participants made me think about my own point of view. In some instances, I have reconsidered my stance on the topics, in others I have become more convinced of what I originally believed. I have learned so much from this period and from the discussions between us. The sessions were a great way to expand my knowledge and take into consideration the views of the other participants. Although I often see myself to be like the Participant 5, this week I felt more myself as the Participant 1. The opinions of the others have shaped my own outlook on the many complex issues we have discussed. This is something that I think is very important, because listening

After the participants reached a consensus view on an issue, we asked them about the level of satisfaction they felt with the consensus view they had reached. The results are shown in the graph below. In general, participants reported being satisfied with the consensus view that they had reached. We were surprised that one of the participants was dissatisfied with the consensus view. We asked them to provide feedback on why they were dissatisfied, and they said that they had not had the opportunity to express their views on the issue. However, this participant had contributed to the debate, and had provided feedback on the draft consensus view. We think that it is possible that this participant wanted to be more involved in the process, and so may not have been satisfied with the consensus view, as they had not had a chance to shape it.
