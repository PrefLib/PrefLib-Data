# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The National Health Service is bureaucratic and inefficient. The NHS is bureaucratic and inefficient because it is lacking leaders with common sense and needs a complete overhaul. The bureaucrats have increased more than the number of nurses by percentage over the past few years. They need to step back from hitting targets and concentrate on doing what it was aimed for and that is helping sick people. The current state of the NHS is too over concerned with procedure at the expense of efficiency and common sense which is not great.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the NHS is too bureaucratic and inefficient. The number of bureaucrats has increased over the past few years and this is causing inefficiency in the system. The bureaucrats are concerned more with hitting targets and making sure that the paperwork is in order rather than focusing on the health of the patients and staff. This has led to a lot of problems in the NHS. It is also important to note that the bureaucrats are not elected officials and so they should not be making decisions on behalf of the people. This is a major problem in the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The National Health Service is bureaucratic and inefficient. It needs to cut back on the number of bureaucrats and allow more room for nurses and doctors to contribute to important decision making. The people who run the affairs of the NHS should be allowed to contribute to important decision making too rather than being completely controlled by state officials. The current state of the NHS is too over concerned with procedure at the expense of efficiency and common sense which is not great.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The National Health Service is too bureaucratic and inefficient. It could be better organised than it currently is. It seems to care more about numbers than the welfare of staff or patients. The people and elected officials who run the affairs of the NHS should be allowed to contribute to important decision making too rather than being completely controlled by state officials. The current state of the NHS is too over concerned with procedure at the expense of efficiency and common sense which is not great.
