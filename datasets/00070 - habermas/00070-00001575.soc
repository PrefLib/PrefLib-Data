# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government are doing enough to combat obesity and it is important to make people aware of the consequences of obesity to encourage people to make healthier choices. We also think that the government should be putting more measures in place to encourage people to take up exercise such as building more sports centres.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It was agreed that the government are doing enough to combat obesity and that obesity is a choice that people have control over. We agreed that this is a huge issue as a lot of obesity leads to people suffering from a range of different health problems such as diabetes and heart problems. We concluded that the government are putting measures in place to tackle the issue of obesity and they are making healthier food options available and that if people want to continue eating unhealthy foods that they should do so at their own risk. It was also agreed that more could be done by the government to tackle the issue of obesity as many people don’t realise the severity of obesity and the consequences that can come with it. There should be more awareness of the negative effects of obesity to make people change their lifestyle.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government are doing enough to combat obesity and that obesity is a choice that people have control over. We agreed that this is a huge issue as a lot of obesity leads to people suffering from a range of different health problems such as diabetes and heart problems. We concluded that the government are putting measures in place to tackle the issue of obesity and they are making healthier food options available and that if people want to continue eating unhealthy foods that they should do so at their own risk. We also agreed that more could be done by the government to tackle the issue of obesity as many people don’t realise the severity of obesity and the consequences that can come with it. The group of participants also agreed that if the government did do more to tackle the issue of obesity, they could focus more on making healthy food options more accessible, so that people in less fortunate positions are more likely to have the option of eating healthy food. The group also agreed that the government could focus more on the psychological impact of obesity and why people may struggle with this, as well as providing more information to people on how to live a healthy lifestyle.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should do more to combat obesity and the risk of severe illness, injury and death as a result. The current steps in place are having a good effect however more can be done to further mitigate the increasing statistics, for example the government can do more to educate people on healthy eating and exercise.
