# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that university tuition fees should be abolished. The current high fees mean that university is only accessible to those with more wealth. The high fees also mean that students are left with a lot of debt, which can prevent them from getting on in life. The group also believe that more needs to be done to ensure university education is available to people from all backgrounds.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should reduce or abolish university tuition fees. The consensus view was reached by all participants having a good discussion about their own views, hearing what others had to say, and coming to a point of agreement that they could all support. The reasons for supporting the reduction or abolition of tuition fees were that the current situation makes it very difficult for people of lower socioeconomic status to go to university. It makes it prohibitively expensive, and so puts them at a disadvantage when compared to people who can afford to pay.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, we should abolish tuition fees as it would be beneficial for the stability of our youth.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Abolishing university tuition fees would be beneficial for the country, because it would encourage more young people to attend university. This would be good for the country because it would increase the proportion of people in higher paid jobs and therefore increase the amount of tax the government gets, which would be good for the economy. The country would be more educated, and the population would have better prospects in life. This is because university students are more likely to end up in higher paying jobs, and are more likely to end up in secure, professional employment, which would have a positive impact on the economy.
