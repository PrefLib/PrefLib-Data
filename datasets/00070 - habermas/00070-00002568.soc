# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I have to say this has not crossed my mind before, and in theory I dont see why not, but I have no idea how it could ever be impletemented, especially with a conservative government. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Absolutely!  It's a communication thing, especially helpful for the older generation.  The media are always going on about loneliness and the internet is a fantastic tool to help combat that.  And for those who need help with education and learning.  The internet is a marvellous thing which I believe we all should be able to have access to in this day and age.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think this would be very beneficial as internet is now an essential utility but I would rather that water or electricity be free for everyone. However, I don't know much about how much this would cost so can't really give an 100% opinion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes I believe broadband should be nationalised and a basic service should be provided for free with an option to pay for higher speeds, internet companies are currently charging far more than they need to in order to make huge profits at the expense of the public. Internet is essential to function in modern society, you cannot get a job today without access to the internet for example so if somebody finds themselves unable to pay for access they won't be able to live properly and as a wealthy developed nation that is unacceptable
