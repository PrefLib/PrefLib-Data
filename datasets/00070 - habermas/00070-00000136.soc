# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not ban gambling on sporting events. Gambling is not inherently bad. Gambling is a good source of entertainment for some people and it increases the enjoyment of some sports events. However, we should monitor people who are addicted to gambling to ensure that they are keeping within their means.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should not ban gambling on sporting events.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In my opinion we should not ban gambling on sporting events because freedom is important. Gambling is not a crime like stealing or violence. It's merely some people freely choosing to engage in a non-violent action.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should not ban gambling on sporting events as it enhances people's enjoyment of them. However, it is important that the government is able to monitor this and take steps to ensure that individuals are not gambling beyond their means.
