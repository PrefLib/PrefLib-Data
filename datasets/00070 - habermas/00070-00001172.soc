# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of replacing the British pound with the Euro. The reasons for this included the fact that the British pound is a strong currency in its own right, and is one of the most traded currencies in the world. It is also a symbol of British identity, and the fact that it is so well known means that it is unlikely to be replaced by the Euro. The fact that the UK has left the EU also means that it is no longer a member of the Eurozone, and thus it would be difficult to adopt the Euro. However, it was also noted that there are some benefits to adopting the Euro, including the fact that it would simplify trade and travel between the UK and the rest of Europe. It was also noted that there are some countries in Europe that use both the Euro and their own currency, and thus it is possible for the UK to do the same. However, it was felt that this is unlikely because the pound is such a well known and recognised currency that the UK government is unlikely to replace it unless there are compelling economic reasons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There was a consensus view in the group that the British pound should not be replaced with the Euro. The reasons for this included the fact that the British pound is a strong currency in its own right, and is one of the most traded currencies in the world. It is also a symbol of British identity, and the fact that it is so well known means that it is unlikely to be replaced by the Euro. The fact that the UK has left the EU also means that it is no longer a member of the Eurozone, and thus it would be difficult to adopt the Euro. However, it was also noted that there are some benefits to adopting the Euro, including the fact that it would simplify trade and travel between the UK and the rest of Europe. It was also noted that there are some countries in Europe that use both the Euro and their own currency, and thus it is possible for the UK to do the same. However, it was agreed that the downsides of replacing the British pound with the Euro would likely outweigh any benefits.

The open-ended question has been demonstrated. The next question in the bank considers the difference between proportional scaling and discrete choice.
