# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The NHS should focus more on preventative medicine. However, this does not mean that it should abandon the treatment of people who are already sick. The NHS should be a balance of preventative medicine as well as medicine for existing health needs. However, preventative medicine could also treat the existing health needs that other medicines are doing now, just earlier. Rather than developing preventative medicines, the NHS could develop early intervention strategies to monitor these health needs before they get to a stage where they need medication.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In the long run, preventative medicine could provide savings and help people live in good health for longer. However, the NHS needs to continue to provide treatment for those who are already suffering from conditions. The NHS should also promote preventative medicine, but its focus must remain on the full-spectrum of treatments.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The NHS should continue to focus on treatment for those with health conditions, but the long-term goal should be to improve preventative medicine in order to reduce the number of those who become ill.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the NHS should increase its focus on preventative medicine, however, it should still keep in mind that those who already suffer from conditions must be given the best care possible. While preventative medicine will reduce the amount the NHS has to spend on operations and treatments, it will not do so immediately.  Therefore, in the short term the NHS must ensure it has adequate resources to meet the needs of all patients.
