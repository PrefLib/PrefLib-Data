# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. The group felt that this would help to recognise the contributions of those who have been overlooked by history, and also to give hope to others in the same situation. The group also felt that this would help to educate people about the contributions of these groups, and to help people to understand the struggles that these groups have faced. The group also felt that this would help to show that society has moved on and that we are more accepting of all people, regardless of their background.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. The group felt that it would be a good way to celebrate the achievements of people from historically marginalised groups, and also to highlight the contributions that they have made to society. The group also felt that it would be a good way to educate people about the history of these groups, and also to highlight the issues that they still face in modern society. The group did note, however, that it would be difficult to choose which groups to celebrate, and that it would be difficult to decide which days to celebrate them on. The group also noted that it would be difficult to decide which historical figures to celebrate, as many of them have done both good and bad things.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of having a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. The group felt that it was important to acknowledge the contributions that everyone has made to our country, especially if they have been generally forgotten. The group felt that it was important to celebrate the achievements of historically marginalised groups, and that it would be a good way to give them more recognition for what they have accomplished. The group felt that it would also give us more hope for the rest of humanity, and what we can do to better the lives of other people. The group also felt that it would be a good idea to teach these sorts of things in school, so that we can become more aware of the contributions of historically marginalised groups.
