# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Meat has long been a part of human history, and a healthy, balanced diet should include some meat, but the industry should reduce the waste it creates and use less cruel methods of production. People should also be encouraged to reduce their intake of meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Meat has been a part of the human diet for a long time. However, it is one of many foods that can contribute to a healthy diet and it is not necessary to consume meat in order to maintain a healthy diet. We therefore should not ban the consumption of meat but should encourage people to make informed choices and should promote plant-based products as alternatives to meat. At the same time, the industry should be encouraged to reduce waste and cruelty and to develop innovative ways to reduce the amount of land, water, and feed that are currently used to produce meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There are pros and cons to eating meat. We should not ban the consumption of meat as it provides people with a good source of protein and is a part of the natural food chain. People should be encouraged to reduce their intake of meat but should be free to make their own choices. The industry should also be encouraged to reduce the amount of waste and cruelty it creates.

Discussion of the process The aim of the exercise was to provide the participants with a very simple way to create a consensus statement that they would all agree to. We started by each participant stating their own opinion and then moved on to a consensus statement that tried to accommodate the opinions of all participants. Once the first draft was created, the participants had the opportunity to provide feedback, which led to a new draft being created. As the process progressed, the participants refined the draft until all participants agreed that they had achieved a consensus. This was a positive experience for all participants, and all felt that they had participated and contributed to the final statement. They also all felt that the final consensus statement was very similar to their own opinions. Conclusion Using this simple approach, we were able to create a consensus statement on an important question. While this approach worked well in this exercise, we acknowledge that it may be more difficult to
