# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is acceptable to put fluoride in the water.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, fluoride should not be added to water. While fluoride is not harmful and is in fact beneficial to dental health, it is not necessary to add it to the water supply. It is better for individuals to decide for themselves if they want fluoride or not. It is also better for individuals to decide how much fluoride they want, as some may want more fluoride than others. Also, adding fluoride to the water supply would not help those in lower income areas, as they may not have access to clean drinking water.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Fluoride is a useful component to put in water, however, the addition of fluoride should be done so with caution and awareness. The amount should be small enough that it does not disrupt the ecosystem of water, yet large enough that it provides benefits to humans. While fluoride has the ability to prevent decay, there is a possibility of overdose if taken in large quantities, which is why fluoride should not be taken in large amounts. This means fluoride should not be taken in large quantities and should be taken in small quantities. It should not be forced upon people and be a choice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although fluoride is good for our teeth, the problem is that not everyone will drink the water. Therefore, it is not an effective way of distributing fluoride to the public.
