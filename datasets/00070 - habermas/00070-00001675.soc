# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a higher minimum wage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “In general, we agree that there should be a higher minimum wage, however we recognise that there are a number of factors that need to be considered. We feel that it is important that employees are paid a fair wage for their work and should be able to live comfortably when working. However, we also recognise that higher wages result in higher costs for businesses which could lead to price increases for the consumer and less jobs if people are paid more highly. Therefore, we do believe that workers should be entitled to a higher minimum wage, especially in the current economy, however it is important to balance employee and business costs carefully. We also think that it is important to consider the impact of a higher minimum wage on the economy as a whole and the impact this may have on the business cycle and GDP.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “The minimum wage should be increased, to ensure that workers can live comfortably, and to prevent people from falling into poverty. However, the minimum wage should not be increased too much, to ensure that businesses can still afford to employ people, and to prevent the loss of jobs. The minimum wage should be increased, but not too much.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “There should be a higher minimum wage in the current economy to help stimulate a successful economy, improve living standards and allow more people to rise out of poverty.  The rich are getting richer and the poor getting poorer whilst large corporations make huge profits.  A higher minimum wage will alongside a regular 4 day working week help stimulate the economy in having more money circulating within the system.  Also a higher minimum wage will help employees live more comfortably and improve job satisfaction and loyalty to their employer.  Whilst it is true that businesses will also have to increase their prices to compensate for the increase in wages, they will also receive more loyalty from their employees and may see an increase in profits.  Furthermore, higher wages will help create a more stable society by allowing more people to have a stable income and achieve a better quality of life.”
