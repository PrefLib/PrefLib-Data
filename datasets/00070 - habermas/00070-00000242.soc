# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that the government should not intervene to make sure that employees of more successful companies are paid more generously.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In principle, yes, the government should intervene to make sure employees of more successful companies are paid more generously, but each case should be considered on its merits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Government should intervene to ensure that employees of more successful companies are paid generously to alleviate some income inequality and redistribute profits.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the government should not intervene to make sure employees of more successful companies are paid more generously.  However, when a company reaches a certain size (e.g. Amazon) or makes a certain amount of profit, the government may want to intervene in order to ensure that workers are paid appropriately.
