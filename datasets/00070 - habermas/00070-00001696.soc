# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The minimum wage for people who are 18 should not be lower than the minimum wage for people who are 25. This is because people who are 18 are adults and should be treated as such. However, it is also the case that older people have more experience in the workforce and therefore this should be taken into consideration. It would be wrong to have a blanket approach where everyone is paid the same minimum wage, regardless of age or experience.  In conclusion, it should be a combination of experience, not just age, that determines the minimum wage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: A reasonable consensus opinion is that a person's age is less important than a person's experience in the workplace, and the minimum wage for a person who is 18 should therefore not be lower than the minimum wage for someone who is 25 if that person has the same amount of experience. Reflective essay In the essay below I will present an analytical discussion of the process that the participants and I went through to come up with a consensus opinion on the question of whether or not the minimum wage for a person who is 18 should be lower than the minimum wage for a person who is 25. I started the discussion group by reading aloud the question for debate to the group and then each participant offered their opinions. Throughout the process all of the participants showed a high level of respect towards each other and were also able to communicate their arguments in a clear and logical manner. Whilst there was some disagreement at the outset, the final result was that a reasonable consensus opinion was reached, and therefore, from my point of view, the process was an overall success.  It was also interesting to observe the change that came about during the process of reaching the final opinion. The first draft was formed from a vague notion of

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The minimum wage for people who are 18 should not in general be lower than the minimum wage for people who are 25. This is because those people who are 18 are legally adults and should be treated as such. However, it is also the case that older people have more experience in the workforce and therefore this should also be taken into consideration. It would be wrong to have a blanket approach where everyone is paid the same minimum wage, regardless of age and experience.  A fair minimum wage for people who are 18 and people who are 25 can be ascertained by looking at different factors and qualifications. These include: education, skills, experience, certifications and special qualifications. Looking at these factors an individual assessment can be made of how the individual should be paid and what would be a fair minimum wage.
