# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although theoretically the government should provide funding for high-speed rail lines between cities, this particular example would not be the best use of available funds. Money would be better spent in other areas such as childcare, education and other social necessities. Additionally, if money were to be available for infrastructure projects such as these, it would be better spent improving existing lines so they run to time and provide a reliable service. The participants had considered the potential benefit of such a project but concluded that in this instance, it would not be appropriate. They also considered that people would rather have their taxes spent on education and social services rather than transport. They acknowledged that transport is important but felt that improvements to existing services would be better than this specific project. Conclusion The question asked the group to form a consensus view on whether the government should provide funding for high-speed rail links. This is a very controversial topic, and it was expected that there would be a wide range of views and beliefs. Interestingly, the group came to the view that whilst such funding is desirable, in this particular instance it would not be the best use of available funds. They also came to the view that tax-payers would rather see their taxes spent on
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: Whilst it would be desirable for high-speed rail links to be developed between major cities, the proposed plan in question would not be the best use of tax-payer money. The UK government needs to tackle a lot of much larger and more pressing problems before it can start spending money on this project. Whilst investment is desirable, it should be in those areas which most need the improvements - schools and healthcare.  If money were to be made available, it would be better spent improving existing lines so they run to time and provide a reliable service.
