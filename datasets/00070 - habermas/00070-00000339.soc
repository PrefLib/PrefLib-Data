# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While the Government should support businesses, it should do so by improving conditions for businesses and not by reducing taxes on business income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Tax reductions should be considered in an effort to support businesses and keep them viable, especially for small businesses and new businesses. Taxes are an important source of revenue for government and reductions in tax should not result in reductions in essential services. Tax reductions should be considered as part of a comprehensive plan for economic growth, which might include other support measures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “The group would like to see business taxes lowered for small businesses, however would like to see a corporation tax hike on larger businesses.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should support businesses by making modest reductions to taxes on business income.
