# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement:  It is right to eat meat. We have evidence from our ancestors which show that they all survived well on a diet including meat, this means that meat has always been a part of life. We have also identified the protein and vitamins that meat can offer to a diet, and the benefits it has to an individual's health. We also want to make it clear that meat should only be free range and natural. This means that we don't support the abuse of animals or the cruelty that they have to experience. Also, only lean meat should be eaten. The benefits are that meat contributes to the economy in both the short and long term, and also the wellbeing of its inhabitants. The importance of understanding where your meat comes from and that it should be locally sourced should not be underestimated. The evidence shows that people are happier when they know where their meat is from.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is the opinion of the group that it is right to eat meat, although we do understand that not all individuals will want to do so. Our research has shown that meat is an important part of a healthy balanced diet, and that it contains lots of proteins and vitamins that are necessary for a human being to function. Our ancestors ate meat, and this is how they survived, therefore meat has always been a part of life. Meat also adds a large contribution to the economy. It is easy to source meat, as it is locally sourced, and is always available. We also believe that only meat that is free range and natural should be consumed. This is so that it is not contributing to the abuse of animals. We do not agree with factory farming and the mistreatment of animals. We think that this is cruel and should not be supported by anyone. We agree that only lean meat should be eaten, and that it should be locally sourced.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that it is the right of each individual to decide whether they want to eat meat or not. However, if meat is to be eaten, it should be free range, and only lean meat should be consumed.

Overall, we think that meat is a very important part of life, and that everyone should have the right to eat meat, but it should be sourced ethically, and only lean meat should be consumed.
