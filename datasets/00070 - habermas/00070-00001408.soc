# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: I believe that the government should eliminate inheritance tax. There are several reasons for my view. First of all it is not fair to the beneficiary to have to pay tax on the money that has already been taxed at the source. If the deceased worked hard and saved over the years, it is not fair to make the beneficiary pay tax on the inheritance that has already been taxed at the source. If the deceased was wealthy he/she would have had to pay high taxes throughout their life and the tax should be enough. Secondly the inheritance does not affect anyone else apart from the beneficiary and so is not a burden on tax payers. The beneficiary has just lost a loved one and has to go through a lot of trauma and stress. It is not fair for the government to exploit their pain for gain. It is wrong for them to take advantage of the circumstances. Finally, there are plenty of other places in which the government could gather money such as from the cars of the rich and other places that don't burden the tax payers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I believe the government should eliminate inheritance tax as it is not fair that the beneficiaries have to pay the tax on the inheritance they have received when it has already been taxed when it was earned. The inheritance is also not a burden to the tax payers of the country as the deceased has already paid his/her taxes throughout their life and the money is for the family who will have to go through the trauma of losing a loved one and I think they should be left to grieve without having to worry about taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that the inheritance tax should be eliminated. We believe that it is not fair to have the beneficiaries pay tax on an inheritance that has already been taxed when it was earned. The inheritance is also not a burden to the tax payers of the country as the deceased has already paid his/her taxes throughout their life and the money is for the family who will have to go through the trauma of losing a loved one and we think they should be left to grieve without having to worry about taxes.
