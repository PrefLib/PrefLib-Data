# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be no limits on how much you can earn. The belief that a person should be able to earn as much as they wish stems from the ideas that a person is free to work as much as they want and as hard as they want, so the rewards they receive are fair. Also the huge amounts of tax these people will have to pay will mean that the government will receive a large boost of income. The extra income the government receive will enable them to lower the amount that people on low incomes have to pay, making things fairer for everyone. We also feel that the best way to reward people for their hard work is through money, as money can be used to purchase a wide variety of items that will satisfy people?s needs. We also believe that we should try and tax the people who are earning the huge amounts of money as much as possible to ensure that the government is receiving as much money as possible. This will then mean that the government can use this money to increase support for people on low incomes and lower the amount of tax that they have to pay, making things fairer for everyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: We have decided to agree on the statement, without the last point, as we agree it is completely contradictory. We feel that the fact that these people will be taxed, and the funds will be used to provide for the less fortunate, means that no limit should be set.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We feel that there should be no limits on how much a person can earn. We feel that as long as a person is prepared to work hard and put in the necessary hours, there is no reason for them to not receive the maximum reward possible. The huge amount of tax that these people will have to pay will allow the government to lower taxes for those on a lower income, and by making the taxes more progressive, we can hopefully make the entire tax system fairer for everyone. The people that do not earn a very high income will not suffer if there are no limits on how much a person can earn. We also feel that the best way to reward hard work is with money. Money can be used to fulfil the needs of these people as well as to provide for the rest of their families, all of which leads to a happier life.

We also feel that it would be extremely difficult to police such a law. This is because people will find a way to get around the law. They will be paid in other ways, such as through share options and bonuses, which will mean that the law will be ineffective. We feel that if the government could find a way to make the law more effective and could ensure that the rich will pay a large amount of tax, this law would be a good idea. We will now consider some interesting extracts from the original discussions. Extract 1 Original: I feel like there shouldn'
