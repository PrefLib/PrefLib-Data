# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I do believe the state should provide free tuition to an extent. I do think students should be able to contribute in some way to the school, depending on whether it is private or public. Additionally, depending on their field of study it could be vital for student contribution in order to have facilities available for them but the state should help alongside. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - This is a tricky one. I believe every young adult in this country should have an equal opportunity to attend university. This does not necessarily mean that everyone should attend university - the majority of jobs do not need a university education, and degrees are becoming devalued. However, the current system of high tuition fees and large student loans disproportionately affects student from a lower income background, can put them off, and can leave them more in debt comapared to better-off peers on graduating. As such, I think means-tested grants should be bought back to allow students from lower income families to attend university for free.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I think the state should perhaps offer this but only to those who are not able to afford the fees.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I believe that the state ought to provide free university tuition because it is in everyone's best interests to have a society formed of well educated individuals. Having people be able to freely access high quality education, free of charge, would open up the possibility for a far wider and more diverse range of individuals to not only gain education for themselves, but also be in a position to bring their own talents, perspectives and ideas to the world. This benefits everyone.
