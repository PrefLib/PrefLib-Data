# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Yes, the government should ban the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad. However, they should also work with other countries to stop the exploitation of workers and to help them receive a fair wage. Also, the products they make should not be sold at a price that takes advantage of consumers. Companies should take responsibility for the products they sell, and a system should be in place to ensure that the workers making the products are being paid a fair wage. There should also be a transparent process in place for when a ban is being put in place. Consumers also need to be made aware of the products they are buying, and they need to be careful of the prices they pay.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The government should ban the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad.  It is not fair on these workers and the cost of banning them would not be too much for people.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of a ban on the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad. However, it was recognised that this would be difficult to enforce, and would not be a long-term solution to the problem. It was also recognised that there are many different standards of living in different countries, and so what is considered to be underpaid may vary from country to country. The group felt that it was important for the government to put pressure on foreign governments to improve the working conditions of their workers. The group also felt that the government should make it a legal requirement for all companies to have their products independently inspected to ensure that they are not being made by underpaid workers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The government should ban the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad, but only if the local government is not taking action to improve the situation.”
