# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be more public ownership of utility companies. The capitalist system of privatised utilities is failing. The people of the UK are paying the highest energy prices in Europe due to profiteering by utility companies, yet there is no accountability. The customer is treated as an inconvenience rather than a person. We are at the mercy of the greed of utility companies and must accept any and all price hikes as they see fit. Public ownership, whether fully or partially, of these utility companies would lower prices and improve the quality of service, so that the money we spend on gas, electricity and water goes back to the people of the UK rather than into the pockets of shareholders.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be more public ownership of utility companies. The privatisation of the industry has proven to be the right decision, but there needs to be some elements of the industry which are publicly owned to ensure stability in the market.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: More public ownership of utility companies is desirable to prevent the current profiteering by large private companies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In principle, yes, more public ownership of utility companies is a good thing. The issue, however, is how this can be done. How can we create more public ownership in a way that is beneficial to both the economy and the public? The group of participants then discussed this question further and came to the following conclusion:

1: 2,4,3,1
1: 1,3,4,2
