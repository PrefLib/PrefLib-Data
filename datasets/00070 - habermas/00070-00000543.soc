# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the UK is more liberal than the US, although both have their liberal and conservative traits. The US is generally more conservative than the UK due to the large role of the Christian religion and the impact it has on the lives of individuals. The UK is less religious than the US, but has a larger liberal population, which can be seen in social attitudes, for example with the attitude to gay marriage, which is still illegal in the US. The US has also tended to become more conservative in recent years, with the introduction of restrictive laws and policies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, we feel that the UK is far more liberal than the US. The gun laws in America are detrimental to the society and are a contributing factor to the high levels of crime. There is an air of intolerance in the US which does not exist in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK is more liberal in some ways as people are more open minded and have their own opinions. The US is liberal with gun laws and this has had a negative impact on the quality of living and crime. Both countries are liberal as they have a democracy voting system rather than operating under a dictatorship.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The uk is more liberal than the us. we are a more tolerant society and allow others to have their own beliefs without passing our own views on to others.
