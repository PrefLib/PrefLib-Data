# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The state should spend more money on protecting the environment. This was achieved by compromising and combining the various opinions, highlighting the main points and creating a short statement. The points highlighted include: ● Looking after the environment is important for future generations ● Our environment is a part of us ● More investment is needed to improve the current state of the environment ● It needs to be a global effort, and everyone needs to do their part to protect the environment The participants did not necessarily agree on all points, but they worked hard to reach an agreement that they could all live with.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the state spending more money on protecting the environment. The majority of participants felt that the environment is in a bad state and that it is a worrying issue. The environment is a core part to our living and functioning. The group also felt that it is the state who are responsible for making it a safe place. It would need to be a global effort in order to make a difference and everyone should do their part in protecting the environment for our own and future generations. The group also felt that the current state of the environment should be worrying to a lot of people. They want their grandkids to be able to have a decent quality of life and understand that we need to protect our natural environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The state should spend more money protecting the environment. There are a variety of ways that this can be done. Firstly, the state can use taxation to raise money and also try and encourage behavioural changes through this method. The state could also encourage private firms to invest in the environment by providing tax breaks and other incentives. The state could also use its own funds and resources to invest in protecting the environment. The state could also provide funds to other organisations who are working to protect the environment. The above consensus opinion was arrived at after considerable debate. The debate was rather difficult and challenging at times, but the end result was that all participants were satisfied with the consensus opinion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The state should spend more money on protecting the environment. We need to protect the environment for future generations. The state has a responsibility to do this. The environment is a core part of our wellbeing. We need to protect it. It would need to be a global effort in order to make a difference. Everyone should do their part in protecting the environment for our own and future generations. We need to look after the future and leave it the best way we can. We as a planet have not worked this out yet. We need to protect the environment for future generations.
