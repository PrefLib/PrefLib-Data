# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Cashless is inevitable and will happen but cash should still be available, even if not frequently used.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should move to a cashless economy, but people should still have the option of using cash if they wish to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that we should move to a cashless society, however we think there should still be the option of using cash. We think that this is important because some people may find it difficult to use cashless options, for example older people or those who have not been brought up in a technological age. Also we think that people should be allowed to use cash as it gives people more freedom to spend the way they wish and makes it easier for them to manage their money. Also, cash is an easier way to budget for small amounts, such as lunches, when compared to using a card. We feel that we should move to a cashless society because it would reduce bank robberies and theft. It is also safer as less people will be carrying cash on their person or in their house and therefore less likely to be a victim of crime. Also it will be more secure as banks are more secure than cash on your person. We think that it will be easier to make transactions as it will save time, such as in supermarkets. It will also be easier for international travel as you will not have to change currency or worry about exchange rates.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of a cashless society. They thought that it would be more efficient, and would reduce the risk of theft and crime. They also thought that it would be easier to keep track of finances and transactions, and that it would be easier to budget. However, they also thought that cash should still be an option, as it is important to have the choice. They also thought that the older generations may struggle to adapt to a cashless society, and that it is important to help them understand the benefits of a cashless society.
