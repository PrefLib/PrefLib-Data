# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “We believe that the current healthcare system is bureaucratic, but it is necessary for the NHS to function. However, there is scope for improvement and we believe that the system could be less bureaucratic if resources were better allocated. There is too much paperwork and this could be reduced to allow for more patient care. We believe that doctors should be able to spend more time with patients and less time doing paperwork. The NHS needs to be more efficient in how it operates and the resources need to be better allocated. We believe that the system needs to be more flexible and allow for more change to occur. The system needs to be more open to change and we believe that if the system was less bureaucratic, this would allow for more change to occur. This would lead to a better healthcare system and better patient care.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The NHS is a bureaucratic organisation, but it is necessary for the NHS to function. There is scope for improvement and the system could be less bureaucratic if resources were better allocated. The NHS needs to be more efficient in how it operates and the resources need to be better allocated. We believe that the system needs to be more flexible and allow for more change to occur. The system needs to be more open to change and we believe that if the system was less bureaucratic, this would allow for more change to occur. This would lead to a better healthcare system and better patient care. The staff should be paid more and given a significantly lower workload, more time off and better benefits. There is too much paperwork and this could be reduced to allow for more patient care. The doctors should be able to spend more time with patients and less time doing paperwork.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “The current healthcare system is bureaucratic and we believe that the bureaucracy is needed to allow the healthcare system to function. However, the bureaucracy can also be counterproductive and can lead to inefficiencies within the system. For example, we believe that some doctors are overloaded with paperwork and this prevents them from giving the best possible care to their patients. The current system is rigid and this prevents change from occurring and it is also demotivating for staff. There needs to be more resources invested in the healthcare system and the resources need to be allocated to areas that are in need of them. There needs to be more freedom for doctors to spend more time with patients and less time with paperwork. This will allow the doctors to provide the best possible care for their patients. It is important that the current healthcare system is open to change and it should be flexible enough to allow change to happen. This will allow for new ideas to be put into practice and this will allow the healthcare system to become more efficient. We believe that the current system is too bureaucratic and there is scope for improvement. However, we believe that some bureaucracy is needed and it is an important part of the system.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The current healthcare system is bureaucratic and this is necessary to ensure it functions. However, there are areas of bureaucracy that can be removed to allow the NHS to run more efficiently. We believe that there is too much paperwork, and this is a waste of time for doctors, and resources need to be better allocated. There is too much waiting for patients and we believe this needs to be improved. We also believe that there is too much central control and this leads to less efficient practices. We believe that there should be more freedom for doctors to make clinical decisions and the system needs to be more flexible and allow for more change to occur. We believe that the system needs to be less bureaucratic and this would lead to a better healthcare system and better patient care.”
