# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of a ban on smoking cigarettes. However, we were all aware that this would be difficult to enforce and that it would lead to people seeking out cigarettes in illegal ways. We also acknowledged that it is a difficult issue, and that we were in favour of a ban because of the health risks to the smoker and those around them. We also acknowledged that cigarettes can be a social activity for some people, and that it would be difficult to remove this from their lives. We felt that the health risks to the smoker and those around them outweighed this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that the current law is adequate, and that there is no need for a ban on cigarettes. Whilst we recognise that smoking is harmful, it is the right of the individual to choose what they want to do. We believe that it is important to educate people on the risks of smoking and to discourage people from taking it up, but not to ban it. We also believe that it is important to make it clear that smoking is not something that should be done indoors, and that it should be done in designated smoking areas outdoors.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to a ban on cigarettes. However, the group was in favour of a ban on cigarettes for people under the age of 18, and a ban on smoking in public places. The group was also in favour of a ban on smoking in cars when children are present. The group believed that smoking is a personal choice and that people should be free to make their own decisions. However, the group also believed that cigarettes are harmful to health and that people should be discouraged from smoking. The group believed that the best way to discourage people from smoking is to provide information on the health risks of smoking, and to provide support to people who want to quit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of a ban on smoking, but recognised that this would be very difficult to implement and enforce. There was also a recognition that it would be very difficult for people who have smoked for many years to give up. The group recognised that there were many health benefits to be gained from a ban, but also recognised that there were many people who would not be able to give up. The group believed that the ban should be introduced for younger people, to stop them getting addicted to nicotine.
