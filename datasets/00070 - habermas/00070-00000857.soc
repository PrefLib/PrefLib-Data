# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should offer more tax incentives to attract foreign investment because this can bring in more capital, expertise and more technology which will improve productivity for the country. This can also create more jobs for the citizens as more companies would be attracted to invest in the UK. However, this can result in the country becoming a tax haven. This allows very wealthy individuals to exploit the benefits and leads to a more unequal society where resources are not fairly divided between people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of offering more tax incentives to attract foreign investment. This is because foreign investment can bring in more capital, expertise and technology which can improve productivity for the country. However, we also recognised that it can result in the country becoming a tax haven. This allows very wealthy individuals to exploit the benefits and leads to a more unequal society where resources are not fairly divided between people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should offer more tax incentives to attract foreign investment. Foreign investment can help to stimulate economic growth and create jobs. It can also bring in capital, expertise and technology, which can improve productivity for the country. The UK should not become a tax haven as this can lead to a more unequal society where resources are not fairly divided between people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the UK should offer more tax incentives to attract foreign investment. This is because foreign investment can bring in more capital, expertise and more technology which will improve productivity for the country. Also this can create more jobs for the citizens as more companies would be attracted to invest in the UK. However, there is a risk that the UK could become a tax haven, allowing very wealthy individuals to exploit the benefits and leads to a more unequal society where resources are not fairly divided between people. Therefore, the government should make sure that this does not happen by making sure that the tax incentives are only offered to companies and not to individuals.
