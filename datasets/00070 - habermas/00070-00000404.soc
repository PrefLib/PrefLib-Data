# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, elderly people should not be encouraged to work, and we should not impose additional conditions such as age limits on elected officials. However, it should be noted that some elderly people may want to work and that they should be supported to do so if they wish. However, this should be a personal choice and should not be something which is imposed upon them by a social security system which does not offer sufficient support for those who do not wish to work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Elderly people should not be forced to work. However, those elderly people who wish to continue working should be given the opportunity to do so. We should not discriminate against elderly people due to age. We should also ensure that our social security system is fair and that people who wish to work longer do not feel pressured to do so because of financial concerns.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People should be free to work as long as they wish, and that the state should encourage elderly people to work as long as they wish. Elderly people should be able to continue working even if their employers do not want them to. They should not be discriminated against in the workplace due to their age, and workplaces should be fully accessible to them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Elderly people should be allowed to choose if they wish to work or not, we should not force them to work against their will.
