# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, we believe that the question posed is not in fact that far-fetched. We are living in a digital age where technology is advancing at a rapid rate. Whilst we don't think that the technology to download the human brain will be available in our lifetimes, we do believe that it is possible. We also believe that the possibility of technology advancing at such a rate is very likely, because of recent discoveries and developments. This technology would be very useful and it could be used to find cures for many diseases, such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons. We do not believe that this would be achieved in our lifetimes but we think that it is possible in the near future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, we believe that the question posed is not in fact that far-fetched. We are living in a digital age where technology is advancing at a rapid rate. Whilst we don't think that the technology to download the human brain will be available in our lifetimes, we do believe that it is possible. We also believe that the possibility of technology advancing at such a rate is very likely, because of recent discoveries and developments. This technology would be very useful and it could be used to find cures for many diseases, such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons. We believe that this technology is not available in our lifetimes, but that it is possible, and that it could be very useful.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, we believe that the question posed is not in fact that far-fetched. We are living in a digital age where technology is advancing at a rapid rate. Whilst we don't think that the technology to download the human brain will be available in our lifetimes, we do believe that it is possible. We also believe that the possibility of technology advancing at such a rate is very likely, because of recent discoveries and developments. This technology would be very useful and it could be used to find cures for many diseases, such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons. Overall we feel that we will discover the digital mechanics of the human brain in the future, but we won't see the emergence of this technology in our lifetimes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, we believe that the question posed is not in fact that far-fetched. We are living in a digital age where technology is advancing at a rapid rate. Whilst we don't think that the technology to download the human brain will be available in our lifetimes, we do believe that it is possible. Our source for this belief is the development of new technologies that are able to utilise the brain. For example, right now there is a device that helps you visualise things on a computer screen when you are blind, this is just the beginning, I believe that this is just one step toward downloading the brain. We also believe that the possibility of technology advancing at such a rate is very likely, because of recent discoveries and developments. This technology would be very useful and it could be used to find cures for many diseases, such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons. Other participants in the same workshop were asked to comment on the most inclusive version of the consensus statement. The comment below was made by someone who had not had access to the earlier drafts of the consensus view:
