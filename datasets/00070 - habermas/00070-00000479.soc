# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should continue to provide development aid to African nations. This is the right thing to do for both the UK and African nations as it will ultimately lead to increased prosperity and higher standards of living. It also helps to build relationships between nations and helps people in these countries to help themselves. The UK has also disrupted African countries in the past through joint invasions and the slave trade which greatly hindered the prosperity of these nations. Although it was a long time ago, there have been knock on effects still being felt today.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should continue to provide development aid to African nations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the UK should continue to provide aid to African nations as it is in the best interests of both nations to do so. However, we do believe that the aid needs to be targeted and effective as there are cases where money has been wasted on inefficient projects which have achieved little. The aid should be given in the form of helping people to help themselves, and by encouraging private investment from within African nations to grow their economy and to develop. There is also an argument that aid should not be provided at the expense of essential home affairs like the NHS, but we believe that both aid and home affairs can be provided for, if done efficiently.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should continue to support African nations, as it is the right thing to do. We should not support people by just giving them handouts but instead we should empower them to build their own country and their own communities. This should be done by giving them the tools and resources they need to do so and if it takes us helping them by sending workers over to help, then so be it.
