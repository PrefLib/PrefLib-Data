# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the government should not have the right to control the internet in times of war. The internet is a place for people to express their opinions and it is important that the government does not restrict this. The internet is not something that the government invented and therefore should not have the right to control it. The internet is a way for people to get information and it is important that the government does not try to control this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, the government should not have the right to control the internet in times of war. The internet is a free and open place where people can express their views, and the government has no right to change that, especially not in times of war. The internet is one of the last places where people can express their views freely, and in times of war this is even more important. The government is not always right, and in times of war it is important that people can express their views freely. The internet is one of the few places where this is possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, the government should not have the right to control the internet in times of war. The internet is akin to freedom of speech and controlling it would mean controlling peoples thoughts, ideas, and information. There are many groups that help keep the internet a safe, informative place. Twitter used to be one. This is an excessive idea. The government doesn't really need so much control. There are more moderate alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, the government should not have the right to control the internet in times of war. The internet is a powerful tool and has been used to spread awareness of war crimes and human rights violations. The internet is the modern equivalent of freedom of speech and controlling it would mean controlling peoples thoughts, ideas, and information. It only sounds like a good idea if you believe your government is the good guy trying to help you but every government is susceptible to creating propaganda. The internet is not something the government created so why should they be allowed to sensor the information on it. People are entitled to free speech etc so no I don't think the government has any right here.
