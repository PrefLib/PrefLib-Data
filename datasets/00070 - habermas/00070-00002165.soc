# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should reduce the number of Members of Parliament by a significant amount. This would allow for more robust and dynamic representation of the general public and allow MPs to focus on matters of importance rather than spending their time making phone calls and opening fetes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The number of Members of Parliament should be reduced, and the remaining MPs should be required to reside in their constituencies.  This will ensure that they are in touch with their constituents and can address their needs.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “I believe that we should reduce the number of members of parliament. The reduction of the number of MPs will result in the elimination of some of the less capable and more ineffective ones, which will allow the ones who are capable and effective to do their jobs more effectively. This will also reduce the cost to the public purse, as there will be fewer salaries to pay. It is also my belief that reducing the number of MPs will result in fewer people being able to hide in the shadows and avoid accountability. This will result in a more effective parliament, and will help to restore public faith in the institution.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We agree that the number of members of parliament should be cut.  A consensus view was reached by the group after careful deliberation.  The group felt that many of the MPs are not acting in the best interest of their constituents and are more concerned with keeping their jobs.  The general public feel unrepresented by their MPs and cutting the number of MPs will reduce the costs to the tax payer, with the remaining MPs better serving their communities.
