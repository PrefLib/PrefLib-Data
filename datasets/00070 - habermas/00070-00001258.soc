# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There are both positive and negative effects that the internet has had on society. It is a great resource for information and communication, but there are also negative effects such as cyberbullying, cybercrime and the spread of false information. The internet has become a part of everyday life, and it is important that we are aware of both the positive and negative effects that it has.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The internet has had both a positive and negative effect on society. It can provide us with useful ways of communicating and easy access to information. Although, there are negatives as well. Our information is more available to the world than it ever has been before, which draws attention so hackers and cyber scams. It is also very easy to read false information/news which brings its own problems. It also has a negative effect with how a lot of people, especially teenagers and young adults are consumed by worry and concern regarding how they are perceived on facebook and instagram. I think it's a shame that people allow the internet to take over their lives and I believe we need to learn to control the internet, rather than letting the internet control us. I also believe that the benefits of the internet outweigh the negatives and if used correctly, can be a powerful tool for the good.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The internet has had a detrimental effect on society. The internet has become a powerful tool in our lives, and the rapid advancement in the ways it has allowed us to interact and access information is nothing short of revolutionary. However, the negative effects of this power, in the form of internet addiction, cyberbullying, the spread of false information, and the manipulation of people are some of the worst that modern society has faced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The internet has had a mostly positive effect on society. It has connected people from all over the world and allowed us to communicate with each other in a way that has never been done before. It has allowed us to share our ideas and opinions with each other, as well as giving us access to a vast amount of information. It has allowed us to learn new skills and find new hobbies, as well as making it easier to find a job. It has also allowed us to stay in touch with our friends and family, as well as allowing us to meet new people. However, it has also had a negative effect on society. There is a lot of false information on the internet, which can lead people to believe things that aren't true. It can also lead to people becoming addicted to social media, which can lead to them becoming isolated from the real world. It can also lead to cyberbullying, which can have a detrimental effect on a person's mental health.
