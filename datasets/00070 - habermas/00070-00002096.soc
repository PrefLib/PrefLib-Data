# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we do not think a person should be allowed to get married to more than one person at the same time.  We believe that marriage is a union between two people and that having more than one spouse at the same time would cause too many complications.  We also believe that it would be difficult for any children of such a marriage to understand their family dynamics.  We do not have a problem with polyamory but do not think it should be allowed within a marriage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We don't think that people should be allowed to marry more than one person at the same time. It is simply not practical to be married to more than one person and there are a number of legal issues which would arise if this was allowed. This would also create more complexity for children, which could be confusing. It is also important to be clear about the difference between polyamory, which is the practice of having multiple relationships, and polygamy, which is the practice of having multiple spouses. A person can have multiple relationships without being married to more than one person, whereas the term polygamy refers to being married to more than one person.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No. Marriage is about a commitment to one person, and I think the bond should be between two people only.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, we do not think a person should be allowed to get married to more than one person at the same time.  We think that marriage should be between two people only, and that this is the traditional view of marriage.  We think that polyamory is fine, but that the legal construct of marriage should remain between two individuals.  We think that allowing people to be married to more than one person at a time could cause issues for children and how they relate to their parents.  It could also be confusing for children born from one of the relationships as to who is their mother or father.  We think that marriage is a special bond between two people, and that the legal construct of marriage should remain between two individuals.
