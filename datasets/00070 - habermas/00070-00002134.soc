# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should tighten up the laws about who can have access to NHS records. This is because the NHS is a public service and is funded by the public. Therefore, it is only right that the public should have control over who has access to their personal data. This is especially important in the current climate of increased data sharing and data mining. This is also important as it is highly sensitive data that could expose a persons vulnerabilities. The laws should shield all patients and anyone involved under the care system of the NHS. It isn't fair to allow just any individual to have access to that level of what should be secure data. If it ended up in the wrong hands it could potentially harm individuals.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe the laws about who can have access to NHS records should be tightened to allow only people who are directly involved in the care of an individual patient to see their records. This is because the NHS is a public service and is funded by the public. The public should have control over who has access to their personal data. It is also an issue of medical ethics, which states that individuals have a right to privacy. People can have vulnerabilities, which can be exposed or used for private gain if the records were to be made available to everyone. It is imperative we keep people's personal information secure to prevent vulnerable people from being exploited.  Periodic table of learning theories: This was a personal project to develop a periodic table of learning theories. Through the comparison of strengths and weaknesses of different learning theories in different contexts and situations, we developed this table. This is a simplistic overview, but it provides a summary of what we concluded.
