# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should be given a free computer at the age of 6 because it will enhance their learning and development and improve their computer literacy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We don't think that it's a good idea to give children free computers at the age of 6.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that children should not be given a free computer at the age of 6. There are a range of negative consequences associated with children spending too much time in front of a screen, as well as the likelihood that computers would not be used as an educational tool and instead be used to play games. It is very important for children to develop important social skills through socialising with friends, rather than spending time alone in front of a computer. We acknowledge the benefits of children being exposed to technology, but believe that 6 years of age is too young to be provided with a computer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In conclusion, the group of participants have come to the consensus opinion that children should not be given a free computer at the age of 6, as we believe it is too young for them. Children should be experiencing traditional social play, engaging with other young people their age and not isolating themselves on devices that have been proven to be addictive. Computers restrict attention spans, and evidence shows that children who read books and play outside grow up brighter and healthier than those exposed to technology at a young age. Children should have access to computers, e.g. for school, however should wait until older to access one permanently.
