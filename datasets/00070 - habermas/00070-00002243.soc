# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we should not make it easier for immigrants to become citizens. The process in place at the moment is more than adequate and we feel that the process should be made more stringent to ensure that the immigrants who come to the UK are able to contribute to society and not be a security risk. We should also consider the impact that immigrants have on the already stretched welfare system and the health system. If we are able to do this then we believe that the UK would become a more desirable place to live in for all people, not just immigrants.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No. We should not make it easier for immigrants to become citizens. If they cannot come to the UK for a valid reason and become contributing members of society then they should not be here, there are plenty of other places for them to go. The current requirements for citizenship are adequate, and in fact, the longer the time taken to become a citizen, the better it is for all of us.
