# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general no, I believe that all you can do is represent them with the facts about smoking - yet, make sure that they are very well informed so that they have all the information they need and, if they decide to go ahead regardless then that's up to them. I think we have to be very careful when it comes to peoples freedoms but it is also important that their freedom does not infringe on others. However I believe that there are other ways of regulating that rather than having to compromise one freedom for another, although I do think encouragement could be a good thing in hoping that they will see the dangers even if tehy decided then and there not to believe them - it's hoped that they will in the future and I believe that's all you can do.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, the government should not have the right to restrict the freedom of its citizens to smoke cigarettes. People should have have a say in what they want to inject/input into their bodies. If someone wants to smoke then let them. Nowadays people are vaping more so then actual smoking. SO many people have quit smoking due to the expense of it anyways.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We generally agree with it.
