# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: In general, the group was in favour of allowing both men and women to serve in the military. Some participants were in favour of allowing both sexes to serve in all roles, including combat roles, while others were in favour of allowing both sexes to serve in all roles except combat roles. The group agreed that there is a difference in physicality between the sexes, but that with the right training and hard work, women can perform just as well as men in most roles. The group also agreed that combat roles are a challenging area and that men are usually better suited to combat both in terms of strength and the potential for sexual violence if captured. The group agreed that we have to balance interests of equality of opportunity versus the practicalities of combat roles.

Conclusion In this paper, I presented two examples of consensus forming from a number of independent perspectives in order to demonstrate the general consensus forming tool that is described in my thesis. In the first example, a panel of four judges was presented with a description of a criminal case along with notes on each of three defendants. Two of the judges came to a quick consensus by voting and sending messages to the other two judges who concurred in their choice. This technique was also used by two of the three members
