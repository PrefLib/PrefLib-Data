# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The monarchy should be abolished.  Although the monarchy does bring in a lot of money to the country in tourism, the cost of keeping them is also very high.  This money could be better spent on the public, for example improving the NHS, or helping people who are homeless.  The monarchy is outdated and is a relic of a time when people were not treated equally.  The monarchy is not elected, and so do not have to answer to the people.  This is not a democratic way to run a country.  The monarchy is also not accountable for their actions.  They can do what they want and are not punished for it.  This is not fair.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of abolishing the monarchy.  It was felt that the monarchy is outdated, and that in this day and age the idea of being ruled over by a monarchy seems a little archaic.  It was also felt that the monarchy is a waste of tax payer money, and that the money could be better spent on public services.  However, it was felt that the current monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, is a perfect Queen to her people in every way and that the monarchy has changed for the better.  The group was therefore in favour of abolishing the monarchy, but not until after the death of Queen Elizabeth II.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The monarchy should be abolished. The cost of maintaining the monarchy is considerable and this money could be better used to improve public infrastructure such as schools, roads and hospitals. The monarchy is an incredibly outdated system which represents a colonial past, a history of slavery and poor treatment of "non-royalty".  It is ridiculous that these people are held in such high esteem in 2023.  It should be abolished and confined to history, and in its place the money that goes towards it should go towards helping those most in need such as the homeless, those on low-incomes and struggling single mothers.  They are a lot of what is wrong with the United Kingdom as we know it today.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the monarchy is a good thing.  It provides a focal point for national pride, it is a tourist attraction and it provides stability.  The current Queen has been a good ambassador for the UK and the royal family in general has helped to bring the country together.  However, the monarchy is in need of modernisation and the royal family need to be more careful with the public money they receive.  The monarchy is an outdated system and it is not clear what they do to earn the money they receive.  We would like to see the royal family doing more to help charities and to help the country as a whole.  We would like to see more of the royal family and for them to be more involved in the day-to-day running of the country.  We would also like to see the monarchy abolished in Scotland and Wales.
