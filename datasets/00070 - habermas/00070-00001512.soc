# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, we think that all students should be required to wear a uniform in schools.  This is because wearing a uniform can have many advantages.  Firstly, wearing a uniform will reduce bullying in schools.  This is because it will stop people being able to tell which group children belong to by what they are wearing.  It will also allow children from poorer backgrounds to not be bullied for what they are wearing.  Secondly, uniforms can also reduce stress for children.  This is because the children will not have to worry about what to wear each morning, as they know that they will be wearing a uniform.  Therefore, wearing uniforms in schools will help to improve student well-being and reduce bullying, which is why we believe all students should wear uniforms in school.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “In conclusion, we believe that students should wear school uniform in all schools. This is because it creates a level playing field for all students as they then look the same this cuts down on bullying as students are all dressed the same. It also cuts down the debate of what to wear each day as the student knows what if required of them and what they have to wear for school. We believe that school uniform is an essential part of the school experience and that it is important for all students to have this experience. This is because it allows students to feel very prepared to learn and not distracted by what they are wearing. It also removes the stress of planning an outfit from young children. Also, stops bullying that often occurs towards students who are financially less well-off. It allows children to feel very prepared to learn and not distracted by what they are wearing. This is why we believe that students should wear school uniform in all schools.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should be required to wear a uniform in schools.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “I believe that students should be required to wear uniforms in all schools, because it makes students feel more equal and stops bullying.”
