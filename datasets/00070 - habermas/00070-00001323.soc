# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Students should be required to wear uniforms in all schools. The reasons for this are that uniforms allow for equality between students, they allow students to feel part of a community, they allow for students to be easily identified by staff and other students, and they provide a sense of identity for the school.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Uniforms are a way of life. Although they do cost a lot of money, this cost is often offset by cheaper prices as compared to buying fashionable clothes. Uniforms help to reduce the differences between different classes of society and promotes a sense of equality. Uniforms also help to reduce the amount of bullying as they can't be picked on for what they wear and what not. Uniforms also help to identify a person's school when they are outside of it, this can help to deter bad behaviour and acts as a positive role model.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although there are many good reasons for and against wearing uniforms, we believe that the wearing of uniforms in schools is a good idea.  We believe that it is important for students to feel that they belong to their school and that wearing a uniform helps to create this sense of belonging.  We also believe that wearing a uniform helps to create a sense of equality between students.  We also believe that wearing a uniform helps to create a sense of pride in a school.  However, we do believe that the wearing of a uniform should not be compulsory.  We believe that it is important to respect the views of those who do not want their children to wear a uniform.  We believe that this is an issue which should be decided by the parents of each child.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: School uniforms should not be compulsory. Children should be allowed to wear clothes they feel comfortable in. They also help to distinguish different schools in an area and show the student's belonging to a school. It also helps to create an identity for the school. The school also needs to work hard to make sure the uniforms are affordable for everyone and that they do not look bad on children who are not of a healthy weight.
