# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Though it is important for children to be taught about their sexual rights, we also need to recognise that some parents may not feel comfortable with the information that may be presented in sex education classes. Therefore, we agree that parents should be able to opt out of sex education classes for their children.  However, we also believe that sex education is an important part of a child’s development. If parents opt out, they should be required to undertake their own sex education with their child, and we should ensure that children receive a minimum standard of sex education from their parents. We would also recommend that other parents are not allowed to opt out of sex education classes, to prevent any one child being disadvantaged or discriminated against.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While it is important for children to be taught about sexual health and their sexual rights, we also need to recognise that some parents may not feel comfortable with the information that may be presented in sex education classes. Therefore, we agree that parents should be able to opt out of sex education classes for their children. However, we also believe that sex education is an important part of a child’s development. If parents opt out, they should be required to undertake their own sex education with their child, and we should ensure that children receive a minimum standard of sex education from their parents. We would also recommend that other parents are not allowed to opt out of sex education classes, to prevent any one child being disadvantaged or discriminated against.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Parental rights should be respected when it comes to a child's education, including sex education. However, it is in the child's best interests that they receive a baseline sex education from their parents. Therefore, we would recommend that parents who choose to opt out of sex education for their children also be required to deliver their own sex education to their child, which we would expect to be a minimum of no less than what would be taught in sex education classes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children should be taught about sexual health and their sexual rights. However, we also need to recognise that some parents may not feel comfortable with the information that may be presented in sex education classes. Therefore, we agree that parents should be able to opt out of sex education classes for their children. However, we also believe that sex education is an important part of a child’s development. If parents opt out, they should be required to undertake their own sex education with their child, and we should ensure that children receive a minimum standard of sex education from their parents.
