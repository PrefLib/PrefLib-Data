# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, free broadband access should be provided by the state. The state should provide free broadband to those who otherwise have no access, especially as library funding is increasingly cut and spaces like that are closed down. However, it should not be provided to everyone, as this would not be a productive use of tax payers’ money.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, free broadband access should be provided by the state. This is because the modern world is increasingly reliant on technology and internet access for jobs, education, and taxation and further circumstances, and those unlikely to have internet access due to age or poverty are at risk of being left behind and unfairly disadvantaged. Free broadband to everyone, even just in communal areas within towns/cities, would make a world of difference for those who otherwise have no access, especially as library funding is increasingly cut and spaces like that are closed down.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The state should provide free broadband access to all citizens. It would be very beneficial to the most vulnerable in society to have free access to the internet as it would ensure their inclusion in the world. It would also allow people to have access to essential services online that would be otherwise more difficult to access, such as health care. It is also beneficial to the economy, as it is often the poorest in society that are unable to pay for broadband, therefore free access would help them improve their lives and they would be more able to contribute to the economy by working and paying taxes. People in the UK would no longer have to rely on public libraries to access the internet. This would be helpful, as these facilities are increasingly being closed down, and are often located in the most deprived areas in society, where access to the internet is needed the most.
