# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the profit motive should not be the main driver of statutory services.  We recognise that it is often necessary to contract out certain services, such as catering or maintenance, and these should be put out to competitive tender.  The government should be responsible for setting the standards for education and the quality of teaching.  This is not to say that profit-making organisations should not be involved in education, but they should not be the main provider.  It is also important to remember that schools are not just places of learning but also social hubs for their communities.  The government should be responsible for setting the standards for education and the quality of teaching.  This is not to say that non-government organisations such as not-for profit trusts should not be involved in education, but they should not be the main provider.  It is also important to remember that schools are not just places of learning but also social hubs for their communities. Conclusion The consensus group method has the potential to greatly improve the quality of debate, deliberation and decision making. It is ideal for online communities of practice where participants might be in different parts of the world. It is also beneficial for using face-to-face, but it does require

What would you do differently, or maybe do the same next time? First, having a concrete question was extremely useful in defining the agenda of the debate. However, I think at times some of the participants strayed from the question into territory not directly related to the question, and maybe we should have done some policing. Also, the more I think about it, the more I feel we should also have incorporated the why into the question - I think that would have made for a more fruitful debate and better answer. For me, the main takeaway is the value of face-to-face debate. I don
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the profit motive should not be the main driver of statutory services.  We recognise that it is often necessary to contract out certain services, such as catering or maintenance, and these should be put out to competitive tender.  Non-government organisations such as trusts can be involved in education, but the government should be responsible for setting the standards for education and the quality of teaching. This is because education is not just about learning but is also important as a social hub for communities.  However, it is important to remember that schools are often places of learning for some of the most vulnerable children in society so we feel that putting profit as the primary goal of schools is not in the best interests of children.
