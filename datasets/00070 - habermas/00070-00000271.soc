# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should not ban the export of all animal products. Doing so would harm the economy and potentially reduce people's access to quality sources of nutrition. In order to provide a good quality of life for all animals, we should look to introduce a number of policies that would help to protect the environment and the welfare of all animals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that we should be putting an end to animal farming and export of animal products in the UK, and the rest of the world. The farming of animals has long term, detrimental effects on the environment. For example, livestock produce a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, and the use of water for these farms can lead to desertification. Also, we do not need animal products for our nutrition. It is possible to get everything we need from a plant-based diet. Banning the export of animal products would also force our country to become more self-sufficient in these areas.  So this example shows that you can actually have a really strong consensus opinion even if everyone's original individual opinion was quite different. This could be a really useful tool for you to use in your essays - when you're making an argument, you should be trying to have a clear view or opinion, and it can help to state this opinion at the start of your paragraph and then spend the rest of the paragraph backing it up. This way, you're making sure that you're writing in a clear and coherent way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the export of animal products should not be banned. However, we must consider the welfare of animals and the environment when considering such a trade. The methods of production should not be cruel or hurt the animals or the environment. Summary of Techniques
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, we do not believe that a ban should be placed on the export of animal products. We are aware of the negative impacts that animal farming can have on the environment, however we believe that if animal farming is done in a sustainable manner, these problems can be mitigated. We are also aware that animal farming is vital for the economy, and many people rely on it for their livelihood. Further, animal products have a significant nutritional value and therefore banning the export of these products would have negative health implications. We are however aware of the importance of a sustainable planet, and have come to the conclusion that the export of animal products should not be banned, but instead, there should be an emphasis on how animal products are farmed.
