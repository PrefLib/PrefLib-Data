# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of a global asylum seeking policy. The group was of the opinion that the current system is unfair and there is a need for a more equitable distribution of the burden of refugees. The group was also of the opinion that refugees should be given the opportunity to seek asylum in any country that they choose, and that countries should not be allowed to select which refugees they want to take in. The group also agreed that the implementation of such a policy would be challenging, but that it is necessary to try and find a solution.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a global asylum seeking policy, however, the group believed that there are some issues that would need to be addressed before such a policy could be implemented. The group believed that it would be very challenging to decide how many refugees each country should take in and that it would be difficult to decide how the burden would be split. The group believed that there should be some sort of vetting process in place to ensure that only refugees who are fleeing war-torn countries are taken in and not people who are just seeking asylum for other reasons. The group also believed that the countries who are currently taking in a large number of refugees should not be burdened with more refugees and that some sort of system should be in place to ensure that the burden is shared fairly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of a global asylum seeking policy. The participants felt that it is important to have a global asylum seeking policy to ensure that refugees receive the protection and assistance that they need. With such policy in place there would be more equitable distribution and responsibility for refugees among countries, which will reduce the burden on the countries that are currently allowing a sizeable number of asylum seekers. However, the group also felt that it is important to consider the capacity of each country. Each country has different capacity in terms of economy, resources and other factors.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of a global asylum seeking policy. The participants felt that the current situation where some countries have to bear a much larger burden than others is unfair and that the current system is not working. The group felt that a global asylum seeking policy would be beneficial for refugees as they would have a greater chance of being taken in and would also have a greater chance of finding a place where they would be happy. The group also felt that a global asylum seeking policy would be beneficial for the countries taking in refugees as they would be able to prepare for the influx of people and also would be able to provide the refugees with the best possible help. The group felt that the main challenge in implementing a global asylum seeking policy would be deciding how to fairly distribute the refugees. The group felt that this would be a very difficult task as each country would have different capacities and different capabilities and it would be very difficult to fairly distribute the refugees.
