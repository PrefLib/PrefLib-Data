# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should tax the use of plastic bags as it encourages people to change to using reusable bags.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A small tax is the best way to go, but in the long term we should stop using plastic bags and find alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that a small tax on plastic bags is good thing. We also believe that we should be focusing on the more bigger issues like plastic bottles which are much more harmful and polluting to the environment. This consensus statement was created by a group of people who held different opinions and views on the issue. As the group progressed through their debate and discussions, it became clear that they had differences in their opinions. As such, they had to adapt their views and their argument so that they could reach an agreement with each other, which was the main task they were asked to complete. The group was successful in reaching this agreement and so created a consensus statement which is shown above.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We feel that the tax on plastic bags is an innefective way of solving the problem. Instead, plastic bags should be banned completely and tax on them should be scrapped. Plastic bags are still easily available and are still polluting the environment. We feel that a tax is ineffective as people can still buy the bags and will not want to use a bag for life. Companies such as Morrisons who use paper bags should be encouraged and there should be a drive for customers to bring their own bags for life.
