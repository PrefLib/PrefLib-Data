# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We think that endangered species should be given a higher priority in government spending. Not only is it our moral duty to help protect endangered species, but the world would be poorer without them and they have many valuable lessons to teach us about our own survival. We have to ensure that the actions we take to protect them do not do more harm than good, so we must make sure that we protect the ecosystems that they are a part of and ensure that their habitat is protected. In order to be able to do this, we must educate people about the importance of the environment and how the loss of species will affect the survival of many other species. We also must ensure that we understand the impact of humans on the environment and work towards reducing this impact. Finally, to make sure that we do not damage the environment further, but still make improvements to the world, we must work hard to ensure that the development of human society is carried out in a sustainable way so that we don't do any more damage. We must use technology to ensure that we continue to develop without destroying the environment that we are a part of and the many species that are a part of it.
