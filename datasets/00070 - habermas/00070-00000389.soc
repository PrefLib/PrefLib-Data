# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “I believe that the benefits system should be more comprehensive, and that the tax system should be revised in order to fund it.  There are currently a large number of anomalies in the benefit system, and I believe that increasing taxes would allow the benefits system to be reformed, and provide help to those who need it.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should reform the benefits system in this country. A fairer and more comprehensive system is one that will help to secure the future of the most vulnerable people in society, and will ensure that they can access the support that they need. The cost of this new benefits system would be a lot to manage and so it would be necessary to increase taxes for the very wealthy, those earning over £150,000 per year, to help pay for it. This would be the best means to secure the long-term future of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Yes, the tax system should be revised. Higher earners should pay more and taxes for corporations should be increased. This would be used to increase benefits for the least well off in society. This would reduce the gap between the highest and lowest earners, which is currently increasing, and help to create a more equal society, in which those most in need are not hit by vicious cuts to benefits and services.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that a more comprehensive benefits system should be put in place. This would help alleviate the stress that many people face when in need of welfare support and would make sure that everyone is treated with dignity and respect. Increasing taxes on the rich would also help fund the additional welfare and would be a way of redistributing wealth more evenly in society.
