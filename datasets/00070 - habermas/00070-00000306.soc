# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, Capitalism in its current form is not morally defensible. It is morally indefensible that so many people around the world are going hungry and living in abject poverty while the world's rich become richer. In its current form, the capitalist system is not equitable and the gap between rich and poor is growing. This cannot continue if the world is to survive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Capitalism in its current form is morally indefensible. It leads to the domination of the few, and the exploitation of the many. The profit motive is often too strong and supersedes basic morals. Inequality is on the rise and the future looks bleak, as the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle classes are increasingly squeezed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Capitalism is not morally defensible in its current form. The way in which people in the UK can live in poverty whilst a small percentage of the population owns the majority of the country’s wealth is morally wrong. Those who have money are so self-absorbed that they do not care about the poor. It is indefensible that there are those who work and are still left in poverty, whilst those with no need to work are still rich.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be some Government intervention in the economy. For example, a living wage should be guaranteed. The people at the bottom of the economy shouldn't be exploited to provide profits for the few at the top. However, to completely abolish capitalism is impossible and would be disastrous.
