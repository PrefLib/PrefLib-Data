# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Cryptocurrencies should not be banned in the UK. We don't think they should be banned because we don't think it is fair to restrict people's freedom to use them. We also think that the government should not ban them because if they do then it will send a message to the world that the UK is not open to new ideas and is not willing to embrace new technology. The government should not ban them because cryptocurrencies can be used to help people in other countries who may not have access to banking and who may not be able to access their own money. We think that the government should put more effort into regulating cryptocurrencies and making them safer for people to use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While there have been problems with cryptocurrencies in the past, it would be a mistake to ban them, as banning them would be a blow to free trade and innovation, and would likely only result in cryptocurrencies migrating elsewhere, to countries with less stringent financial regulations. Instead, the UK should establish and enforce laws regarding the legal use of cryptocurrencies, and use all its powers to prevent the illegal use of cryptocurrencies, so as to reduce the harm caused by their illegal use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should make it harder for people to buy crypto, but not impossible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should ban all cryptocurrencies.
