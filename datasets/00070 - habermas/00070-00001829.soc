# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general no, I believe that all you can do is represent them with the facts about smoking - yet, make sure that they are very well informed so that they have all the information they need and, if they decide to go ahead regardless then that's up to them. I think we have to be very careful when it comes to peoples freedoms but it is also important that their freedom does not infringe on others. However I believe that there are other ways of regulating that rather than having to compromise one freedom for another, although I do think encouragement could be a good thing in hoping that they will see the dangers even if tehy decided then and there not to believe them - it's hoped that they will in the future and I believe that's all you can do.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should have the right to restrict the freedom of its citizens to smoke cigarettes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should have the right to restrict the freedom of its citizens to smoke cigarettes.

The government should have the right to restrict the freedom of its citizens to smoke cigarettes because it is harmful to the health of others. The government should have the right to restrict the freedom of its citizens to smoke cigarettes because it is harmful to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the government restricting the freedom of its citizens to smoke cigarettes. The group was of the opinion that people should have the right to choose what they want to do with their bodies, and that the government should not have the right to restrict this freedom. The group did, however, agree that the government should be responsible for making sure that people are aware of the health risks of smoking, and that people should be encouraged to stop smoking cigarettes.
