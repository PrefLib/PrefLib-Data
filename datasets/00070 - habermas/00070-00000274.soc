# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of legal immigration, but with conditions. We felt that people should be able to immigrate if they have skills that are in short supply in the UK, or if they are unable to live safely in their current country. We felt that immigration should be limited to people who are able to contribute to the country, such as those with skills, and we didn't feel that unskilled workers should be allowed to immigrate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of legal immigration, but with conditions. We felt that people should be able to immigrate if they have skills that are in short supply in the UK, or if they are unable to live safely in their current country. We felt that immigration should be limited to people who are able to contribute to the country, such as those with skills, and we didn't feel that unskilled workers should be allowed to immigrate. We also felt that all immigrants should be vetted to ensure that they are not criminals, and have a good character, and we feel that they should be able to integrate into UK society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We felt that people should be able to immigrate if they have skills that are in short supply in the UK, or if they are unable to live safely in their current country. We felt that immigration should be limited to people who are able to contribute to the country, such as those with skills, and we didn't feel that unskilled workers should be allowed to immigrate. We felt that skilled immigrants who are legally immigrating to the UK should be vetted to ensure they have no criminal convictions pending or in their past, and that they are of good character and able to integrate with everyone here and also respect our way of life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of legal immigration, but with conditions. We felt that people should be able to immigrate if they have skills that are in short supply in the UK, or if they are unable to live safely in their current country. We felt that immigration should be limited to people who are able to contribute to the country, such as those with skills, and we didn't feel that unskilled workers should be allowed to immigrate. We also felt that those wishing to immigrate should be strictly vetted to ensure that they have no criminal convictions, either pending or in their past.
