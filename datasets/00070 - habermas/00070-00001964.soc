# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the government requiring all people to pay for some form of private health insurance. The group felt that this would be a very unfair system which would put us in a position similar to America where some individuals are unable to access appropriate healthcare. The group felt that the current system, where we pay through our national insurance for the health care we receive via the NHS which is a fair system and free at the point of use for all, is the best system. The group felt that the NHS is a very important part of our society and should be protected. The group felt that the NHS is a very important part of our society and should be protected.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the government requiring all people to pay for some form of private health insurance. However, we believe that there should be a system in place which would allow people to voluntarily pay for additional private health insurance on top of the healthcare provided by the NHS. This would allow people to have access to additional services such as dental care and opticians, and would also provide a system of private healthcare which people could access if they so wished. We believe that this would be a fair system which would allow people to access the healthcare they want, and would also allow the NHS to continue to provide healthcare for all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People should have a right to universal healthcare and we should not be discriminating against those who cannot afford it. Healthcare should be free and I think that taxing people to pay for it is a reasonable solution to fund it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group was in agreement that universal healthcare is a human right, and should not be subject to one's ability to pay. There is a danger that requiring all people to pay for health insurance, especially in cases where people are unable to do so, will limit access to healthcare, particularly for the most vulnerable in society. However, the group also acknowledged that some people are unable to pay for their health insurance and therefore they should not be allowed to access private healthcare, as this may lead to a drain on resources which are needed to fund healthcare for those who are unable to pay. The group was in agreement that a national insurance based healthcare system would be most appropriate, as it is fair and proportionate. The group also noted that for any system to work, the government must ensure that there are adequate funds available to fund the health service.
