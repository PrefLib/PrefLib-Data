# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A move to more sustainable energy sources is likely to make a real difference to global warming. It is clear that a move to more sustainable energy sources will have a significant impact on global warming. This is because the majority of our energy sources are not sustainable, and are contributing to global warming. A move to more sustainable energy sources will help to reduce the effects of global warming.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The move to more sustainable energy sources is likely to make a real difference to global warming. We have to do something. There are no downsides.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We have come to the conclusion that the move to more sustainable energy sources is likely to make a real difference to global warming. This is because the more people use sustainable energy, the less they will be using fossil fuels. This means that there will be less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which will have a positive impact on global warming. However, we also believe that the move to more sustainable energy sources is not the only thing that needs to be done to combat global warming. There are many other things that need to be done, such as reducing deforestation, reducing the amount of waste that is sent to landfill, and using public transport more. We also believe that it is important to inform people about what they can do to help combat global warming. We believe that this will help to make a real difference to global warming.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We all agreed that the move to more sustainable energy sources is likely to make a real difference to global warming. The use of sustainable energy will reduce the amount of emissions produced by energy production and thereby contribute to the reduction in the amount of greenhouse gases. We also agreed that there are many other things which need to be looked at such as energy efficiency in our homes, energy usage in transport, use of energy in business and factories. We all agreed that these areas need to be addressed but that we cannot rely on these alone to make a real difference to global warming. Conclusion: It is clear that a move to more sustainable energy sources is necessary. We need to take action on many fronts to make a difference. The following are actions which we need to take. Actions to take 1. Reduce energy consumption. 2. Use energy efficient products. 3. Recycle 4. Use energy from renewable resources 5. Avoid use of private cars and use public transport. 6. Eat less meat. 7. Plant trees. 8. Stop pollution. 9. Conserve energy. 10. Use solar panels.
