# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should absolutely make every effort to end fox hunting. It is barbaric and unnecessary, and the people that support this have no morals. The animal is innocent and this is beyond cruel on every single level. The poor animal does not have a choice and must go through immesurable panic and pain and it is heart breaking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of banning fox hunting, but some participants expressed concerns about whether this was a fair law, and whether it was hypocritical to ban fox hunting but still allow commercial farming methods.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Fox hunting is wrong and should be banned. It is a cruel and unnecessary pastime which is outdated and does not fit with modern values. There is no excuse for the barbaric treatment of foxes. The people who engage in this activity are immoral and have no respect for life. There are many other activities which can provide the same adrenaline rush as fox hunting without the need to kill an innocent animal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We think fox hunting is a disgusting hobby that should be banned. We do not think it is fair on foxes and we think that they should be able to live their lives without being killed for sport. We think that foxes are a major pest in the countryside, but this does not justify the violence of hunting them with dogs and killing them. We think that it is wrong to hunt any animal, and especially foxes, and this should be banned.
