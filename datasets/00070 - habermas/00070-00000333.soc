# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group believes that the government will eventually reduce the number of working days a year to allow for more days of rest, relaxation and entertainment for the UK workforce. However, we believe that this will not occur for several years to come. Currently, the British economy is in a bad state and the public sector is being cut back heavily. The government will therefore be very cautious in making any changes that may seem as though they are trying to hinder the economy in any way, or trying to take away from the amount of tax revenue which they currently receive. However, when the economy has stabilized and returned to a healthy state, and unemployment levels have decreased, the government may consider changing the current number of working days a year. The final decision will depend on the impact on the economy and whether there is a need for the number of days a person is allowed to work to be reduced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the UK will reduce the number of days a year on which a person is allowed to work. However, we do not think that this will happen for several years. The government is currently cutting public sector jobs and therefore will be hesitant to do anything that might hinder the economy in any way. Therefore, the government will wait for the economy to recover fully before making any changes to the number of working days.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group believes that the UK government will eventually reduce the number of working days a year to allow for more days of rest, relaxation and entertainment for the UK workforce. However, we believe that this will not occur for several years to come. The UK economy is currently in a bad state and the public sector is being cut back heavily. The government will therefore be very cautious in making any changes that may seem as though they are trying to hinder the economy in any way, or trying to take away from the amount of tax revenue which they currently receive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government will not reduce the number of days a person is allowed to work in the foreseeable future. They are currently more interested in reducing the welfare budget and encouraging people to find work, so they will not change the current rules for a while. Eventually, however, they will want to do so, for the sake of the working population, as they will begin to realise that the new working conditions are working well in America and are helping to produce a more productive workforce.
