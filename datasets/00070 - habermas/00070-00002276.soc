# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the banning of tobacco.  The main argument for this was that people have the right to make their own choices and to live their lives as they see fit.  The group did not want to see the government dictating to people and taking away their freedom of choice.  The group felt that education was the best way of reducing the number of people who smoke.  However, the group did feel that the government should be doing more to discourage smoking and to help people give up smoking.  The group felt that more should be done to make people aware of the dangers of smoking and to discourage young people from taking it up in the first place.  The group felt that the government should also be doing more to help people give up smoking, for example, by making nicotine patches and gum more readily available on the NHS.  The group felt that the government could also do more to discourage smoking in public places and to make it less socially acceptable.  The group also felt that the government should be doing more to discourage the advertising of tobacco products.  The group felt that the government could also do more to discourage the sale of tobacco to young people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although the effects of tobacco are well documented and we should not encourage people to use tobacco, we think that individuals should have the right to make their own decisions about what they choose to consume.  The government should concentrate on educating people on the effects of tobacco, rather than banning it.  Perhaps, if the number of smokers drops as a result of education, there will be no need to produce tobacco.  If that is the case, then the decision on whether to continue production will be taken out of our hands.  This would mean that, in time, we would not have to worry about this issue.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, while we recognise the very real health issues associated with smoking, we do not think that a ban on the sale of tobacco is a good idea.  This is because a ban may force people to get their cigarettes from a black market, which puts people in a potentially dangerous situation.  A ban may also set a precedent for banning other substances which the government believes are unhealthy, such as red meat, which could ultimately lead to the government banning other things that we enjoy.  If we want to reduce the number of people smoking, we believe that more should be done to educate people on the dangers of smoking, rather than banning the sale of cigarettes altogether.   This example demonstrates how the discussion moved from being centred around the issue (banning tobacco) to a discussion of the rightness or wrongness of banning tobacco and what might happen if it were banned.  It also shows how the different participants considered different factors, such as personal health, the economy and individual freedom.  This example demonstrates how it can be difficult to reach a consensus on an issue that is highly complex and involves different values and ethical positions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of a ban on the production and sale of tobacco.  The group felt that this would be the best way to discourage people from using tobacco and to reduce the number of tobacco related deaths.  The group felt that education is not enough to discourage people from using tobacco, as the addictive nature of tobacco means that people will continue to use it even if they know that it is bad for their health.  The group also felt that a ban on tobacco would reduce the burden on the NHS, as there would be fewer tobacco related illnesses.  However, the group was aware that a ban on tobacco could lead to a black market in tobacco, which could lead to other problems such as an increase in crime.  The group felt that a ban on tobacco could also lead to a ban on other substances deemed harmful by the government, which could lead to a loss of freedom.  The group felt that a ban on tobacco could also lead to people procuring banned products using black-market avenues that put the customer at greater risk.  Therefore, the group felt that a ban on tobacco would be the best way to discourage its use, but that it is important to be aware of the possible negative consequences of
