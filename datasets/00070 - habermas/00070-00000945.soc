# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the government should be able to use CCTV footage to solve crimes. The use of CCTV is very widespread in society today and the public are aware that they are being captured on CCTV. Therefore, it is reasonable for the government to use this footage to solve crimes. The use of CCTV footage should be regulated, with only a limited number of people being able to access the footage. The footage should be kept secure so it does not reach public domain. The use of facial recognition technology should be restricted and there should be safeguards in place to protect privacy and anonymity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the government should be able to use CCTV footage to solve crimes. However, the footage should only be used for serious crimes and not minor crimes. There should be checks and balances in place to make sure the footage is not abused. The footage should only be used as a last resort when there is enough justification to need to use it. The footage should only be accessed by a restricted number of persons. The footage should only be used in public places where people choose to enter. The footage should be kept secure so it does not reach public domain.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the government should be able to use CCTV footage to solve crimes. This is because it can be a useful tool in solving crimes and in preventing crime. It can also be used to identify people who may have committed a crime. It is also important to remember that the public are aware that they are being filmed in public places. However, the footage should be kept secure and access to it should be limited to those who need it. The footage should also not be used for minor crimes. It should be used as a last resort when there is enough justification to need to use it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In principle, the government should be able to use CCTV footage to solve crimes. However, the use of the footage should be strictly regulated and only used when there is a strong justification for it. The use of the footage should also be limited to public spaces where people are aware that they are being filmed. The use of facial recognition technology should be avoided and the footage should be kept secure to protect the privacy of people captured on it.
