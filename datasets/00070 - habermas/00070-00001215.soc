# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People should not be forced to wear masks on buses.  If they have the virus then they should not be going on buses.  I think the person who caught it in America may have been on a bus with a passenger from another country who caught it there and passed it on.  So if you want to wear a mask then thats fine but dont pass the blame onto others who havent caught it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While it is important to protect people on buses from COVID, it is important to acknowledge that COVID is declining and people have to start getting back to normal and being able to travel safely. Therefore, the group feels that as long as people are practising social distancing and are not feeling ill, that they should be allowed to make the decision to wear or not wear masks on buses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People should not be forced to wear masks on buses. This is because wearing a mask is a personal choice, and people should be allowed to make their own decisions. However, if there is a large outbreak of a virus such as COVID, then people should be forced to wear masks on buses to prevent the spread of the virus.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, people should not be forced to wear masks on buses. If they want to wear one for their own safety, then that is their choice. If they choose not to, then that is also their choice. The bus is a very small space and it is very easy to catch a cold/virus from someone else. If any person on the bus catches the virus, it is very likely that they will spread it to other family members/colleagues and the best way to avoid this situation is by wearing a mask on a bus if you're feeling unwell. However, this should not be forced.
