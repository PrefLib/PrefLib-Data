# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Generally foreign investment in domestic industries has been positive, but that assumes that no domestic investment would have come forward to take its place.  What it certainly means is that the rewards that flow from the investment also flow overseas, and this is clearly detrimental to the country.  Where foreign investment has been positive is where it has created an extra competitor, which propels continuous investment and lower end prices, but too often foreign investors have been allowed to take meaningful stakes in quasi-monopolies such as the water industry and the national lottery.  Foreign investment is good but measures should be put in place to limit a negative effect.  It is important that these industries are protected and paid for within our country to support and enhance them.  I believe we should restrict foreign investment in domestic industries.  There is a risk that foreign companies may pursue objectives in contradiction with what is beneficial for the public and sometimes they are also instructed by foreign governments.  Critical domestic industries should be shielded from foreign interference.” (please see the individual answers for sources of evidence)
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Foreign investment in domestic industries has generally been positive. However, this assumes that no domestic investment would have come forward to take its place. What it certainly means is that the rewards that flow from the investment also flow overseas, and this is clearly detrimental to the country. Where foreign investment has been positive is where it has created an extra competitor, which propels continuous investment and lower end prices, but too often foreign investors have been allowed to take meaningful stakes in quasi-monopolies such as the water industry and the national lottery. I believe we should restrict foreign investment in domestic industries. It is important that these industries are protected and paid for within our country to support and enhance them. Whilst foreign investment is fine in theory, the importance of the country isn't considered when it's an external investor; only money. There is a risk that foreign companies may pursue objectives in contradiction with what is beneficial for the public and sometimes they are also instructed by foreign governments. Critical domestic industries should be shielded from foreign interference.
