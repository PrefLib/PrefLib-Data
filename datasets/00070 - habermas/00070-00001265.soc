# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We think employers should not be forced to give their employees one day off each week. However, it is very important that workers are given time to rest and recuperate after any stress or anxiety at work. This will also give workers a chance to spend time with their families and loved ones and to get out of the house and have a change of scenery. It is important that employees are allowed to have this time off, even if it is not necessarily every week. Employers should recognise the importance of their workers having a break from the stresses of their working life and so it should not be a requirement that they must give employees one day off each week.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although it is important that employees get time off work to recover and relax, employers should not be forced to provide their employees with at least one day off from work each week. It is important to allow employees to have a certain amount of time off each year, however, there are many employers that provide staff with the time off they need without the need for a legal requirement. Furthermore, businesses need to be profitable and having a day off each week for all employees may not be a viable option.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that employers should be forced to provide their employees with at least one day off from work each week. This is because it has been proven to improve workers mental health and also improve their positivity and morale when in work. This will result in them working better and to a higher standard. It is also important for their physical health as it allows them to recover from any stresses that occur at work and also allows them to spend time with their families. This will result in them being happier and more motivated when they are in work. This will also reduce the amount of sick days taken as employees will be less likely to be stressed and overworked.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Employers should be forced to provide their employees with at least one day off from work each week. This will help with the mental health of employees as they will be able to rest and relax. It will also help with their physical health as they will be able to recover from any stresses that occur at work. This will also benefit the safety of employees as there will be less accidents.
