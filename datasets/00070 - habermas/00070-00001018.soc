# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the increased use of genetically modified crops in the UK. The group felt that, in general, the crops were safe to eat and that they could be more resistant to weather changes. However, they did express concerns over the long term effects of genetically modified crops on the soil and the health of the people eating them. They also expressed concerns that the introduction of these crops could lead to increased profits for large companies and a loss of profits for small farmers. They also expressed concern that the introduction of these crops into rich countries could mean that poorer countries are unable to afford these products, putting them at a disadvantage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the increased use of genetically modified crops in the UK. The group felt that, in general, the crops were safe to eat and that they could be more resistant to weather changes. However, they did express concerns over the long term effects of genetically modified crops on the soil and the health of the people eating them. They also expressed concerns that the introduction of these crops could lead to increased profits for large companies and a loss of profits for small farmers. In the end, the group decided that we should be in favour of increasing the usage of genetically modified crops, but with careful monitoring of the effects on the soil and the health of the people eating them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the increased use of genetically modified crops in the UK. The group felt that, in general, the crops were safe to eat and that they could be more resistant to weather changes. However, they did express concerns over the long term effects of genetically modified crops on the soil and the health of the people eating them. They also expressed concerns that the introduction of these crops could lead to increased profits for large companies and a loss of profits for small farmers. They felt that the increase in profit for large companies could lead to the disappearance of small farms and an increase in unemployment in the farming industry. They also felt that these companies could start to monopolise the market, leading to unfair competition and possibly less choice for consumers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the increased use of genetically modified crops in the UK. The group felt that, in general, the crops were safe to eat and that they could be more resistant to weather changes. However, they did express concerns over the long term effects of genetically modified crops on the soil and the health of the people eating them. They also expressed concerns that the introduction of these crops could lead to increased profits for large companies and a loss of profits for small farmers. However, they felt that this loss of profits would not affect small farmers, as they could also buy the seeds and increase their own crop yield. They also agreed that in poorer countries, the introduction of genetically modified crops could present problems for poorer farmers, and the increased yields from genetically modified crops could lead to lower prices, putting small farmers out of business.
