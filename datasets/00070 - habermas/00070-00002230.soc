# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we should not have an unelected House of Lords. It is undemocratic to have unelected members of parliament. It is also unfair that unelected peers can vote on laws that affect us all. The unelected peers are appointed by the Prime Minister and therefore may not represent the views of the people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe the unelected House of Lords should be abolished. Unelected peers don't truly represent their local communities and this means that their voting is biased. It also makes the system seem unfair and undemocratic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No we should not. It is fundamentally undemocratic and outdated to have unelected members of the House of Lords. If they are to speak for us and have our best interests in mind, they should be elected into their position. In addition, there have been many recent instances of cronyism, where unelected members have been appointed to the House of Lords to represent the interests of a political party, rather than the people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we should not have an unelected House of Lords. This is because it is undemocratic to have unelected members of a political structure and it is also unfair to the public who do not have a say in who is representing them. The unelected House of Lords also has a history of being stuffed with cronies and donors that contribute nothing while being paid a lot of taxpayer money. The unelected second chamber also results in the House of Commons and therefore the Prime Minister holding far to much power, as the House of Lords is unelected, it is ultimately does not have a mandate to stop anything the largest party in the commons wants to get through. This causes our system to be lopsided and lacking in checks and balances required for a functioning democracy.
