# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: As a society, we need to ensure that we give people the opportunity to improve their lot and ensure we have a fairer society. We need to have some basic principles and systems in place to ensure we achieve this. In the past, the gap between rich and poor has grown. Taxation needs to be more progressive and targeted towards the rich.      We also need to recognise that the "rich" is a vague term. Rich to me may not be rich to someone else. Therefore, the term should be quantified. I think we need to also take into account how someone's wealth has been gained. Some people may have received a large inheritance or have built a successful business, and it would be unreasonable to tax them at the same rate as someone who has simply been lucky.      Whilst increasing taxation, we also need to ensure that the money raised is spent on good projects and that the people paying the taxes can see that their money is being put to good use. This will ensure the trust in our politicians and other decision makers is maintained. It also means that we will have a more productive and happy society.      I believe
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “I am not in favour of increasing taxes on the rich, but I think that the rich should be made to pay their fair share and not be able to avoid tax by using tax avoidance schemes.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group believes that taxation on the rich should be increased.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of increasing taxes on the rich. The group felt that the rich should be taxed more in order to reduce the gap between the rich and poor. The group felt that this would be fairer and would also help the economy by putting more money into the pockets of the poor, who would then spend it. The group felt that the rich should be taxed on their wealth as well as their income, as this would ensure that the tax system was fairer. The group felt that the rich should not be allowed to become too rich and that there should be a limit on the amount of wealth a person can have.
