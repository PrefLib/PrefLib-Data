# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a more concerted move to healthy eating (at realistic and appealing prices). It is, disappointingly, too easy and often too cheap to go for an unhealthy fast food option. The consumption and availability of fast, processed foods needs to be reduced so that we are all eating healthier. The food is ultra-processed, which is increasingly coming under scientific scrutiny in terms of the impact to our health. To be fair it would be more effective to reduce the cost of healthy food and make it more widely available. People still need to take personal accountability for their actions. Theres a lot of things to try but for sure, the proliferation of fast food restaurants isn't helping the health standards of the general population. The food produced by them is horrible for people's health. It lacks any sort of nutrition and is full of sugar, salt and other chemicals which are bad for peoples health. Cutting down on their quantity would be beneficial for the nation's health, which of course has benefits that bleed into other areas, like reduced stress on the NHS and a happier and more intelligent populace.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should cut down on the number of fast food restaurants. The proliferation of fast food restaurants has not helped the health standards of the general population, and the food is often unhealthy and lacks any sort of nutrition. We should be promoting a healthy lifestyle and providing people with healthy food options. We should reduce the number of fast food restaurants and make it more expensive for them to open. This will cut down on the number of people who are becoming obese and will also cut down on the amount of money that is spent on obesity related issues. We should also promote healthy eating in schools and teach children at a young age how to make healthy food choices.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should cut down on the number of fast food restaurants. Fast food restaurants promote unhealthy food that is cheaply available. The food appeals to children and teens, who lack awareness of what they are putting into their bodies. The food is ultra-processed, which is increasingly coming under scientific scrutiny in terms of the impact to our health. Fast food is also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The food is often not fresh, and is full of preservatives, salt and sugar. Fast food restaurants are also often located in poorer areas, where people may have no other option but to eat fast food. Fast food restaurants also increase the risk of obesity, which can lead to other health problems. Fast food restaurants should be cut down in number, and the government should be looking at ways to make healthy food more widely available and more affordable. The jobs provided by fast food restaurants should be replaced with healthier alternatives, and local governments should be looking at ways to encourage this.
