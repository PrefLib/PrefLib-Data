# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The effectiveness of a board is its ability to make sound and effective decisions. In order to achieve this, board members must work collaboratively to find the best way forward. A board with members of differing backgrounds, both in terms of demographics and in terms of their experience and expertise, will have a more well-rounded perspective when considering options and will therefore be more likely to reach a solution which is effective. In addition, it is important that a board of directors reflect the diversity of the company's workforce as a whole to show that it is inclusive of the range of values, preferences and opinions of the entire workforce and that the needs of all the individuals within the workforce are considered.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that having a diversity of demographics amongst a board of directors is important for the effective governance of a company. While it can help to have people who are similar to each other in board meetings, they must be able to consider views and concerns from all parties involved in the issue at hand and it is only in having a boardroom of diversity that this can be done. It is also important for people to be able to see others on the board as role models and feel as though their company values their contributions. A board which reflects the demographic make-up of the company's average workforce will encourage this. Exercise 2: A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft of a consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement by the participants, and the final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: A board of directors which is diverse in terms of the backgrounds and experience of its members will be more effective than a board which is comprised of individuals who are all the same.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: A company's board of directors is responsible for ensuring the effective governance of the company and therefore for formulating policies to guide the direction of the company and its employees. In order to do so, board members must work collaboratively to find the best way forward. A board with members of differing backgrounds, both in terms of demographics and in terms of their experience and expertise, will have a more well-rounded perspective when considering options and will therefore be more likely to reach a solution which is effective. In addition, it is important that a board of directors reflect the diversity of the company's workforce as a whole. This will ensure that the board is aware of the needs of the company as a whole and will be better able to consider the needs of all stakeholders when making decisions.
