# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country. The current system is very difficult to navigate and in some cases, the process can take years. This means that those who are in genuine need of asylum are often left in limbo, in fear of their lives, while their application is processed. The system needs to be streamlined to make it easier for those in genuine need to access asylum. It is also important that the UK government works with other countries to support them in providing safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to access the UK. We also recognise that asylum seekers can have an impact on local communities, and that this impact should be recognised by the government, and funding to support local communities should be available.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country. The current system is very difficult to navigate and in some cases, the process can take years. This means that those who are in genuine need of asylum are often left in limbo, in fear of their lives, while their application is processed. The system needs to be streamlined to make it easier for those in genuine need to access asylum. It is also important that the UK government works with other countries to support them in providing safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to access the UK. In addition, the UK government should provide support to local authorities and individuals who host asylum seekers to ensure that they can meet the needs of those seeking asylum.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country. The current system is very difficult to navigate and in some cases, the process can take years. This means that those who are in genuine need of asylum are often left in limbo, in fear of their lives, while their application is processed. The system needs to be streamlined to make it easier for those in genuine need to access asylum. It is also important that the UK government works with other countries to support them in providing safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to access the UK. The UK should be proud of its status as a world leader on asylum for Syrian, Afgan and Ukrainian refugees and should continue to support asylum seekers from these countries. However, it is also important to recognise the length of time that it takes to have asylum granted in the UK and to ensure that the process is as quick and efficient as possible. The UK should also ensure that local authorities, or local inhabitants have access to funding to support asylum seekers and their specific needs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country. The current system is very difficult to navigate and in some cases, the process can take years. This means that those who are in genuine need of asylum are often left in limbo, in fear of their lives, while their application is processed. The system needs to be streamlined to make it easier for those in genuine need to access asylum. It is also important that the UK government works with other countries to support them in providing safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to access the UK. A scheme should also be created to support families that take in asylum seekers, essentially an extension of the current system for Ukraine refugees, to assist with extra costs locally to support those helping those in need.
