# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Immigrants who have lived in the UK for a minimum of 5 years and have a legal right to remain in the UK should be allowed to vote in local and national elections. It was felt that this would be a good way of integrating immigrants into the local community and also to allow them to have a say in the way their local community is run.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing immigrants to vote in local and national elections. It was agreed that the immigrants should have lived in the UK for a minimum of 5 years and have a legal right to remain in the UK. This would allow them to have a good understanding of the local and national issues and also to have contributed to the local community. It was felt that this would be a good way of integrating immigrants into the local community and also to allow them to have a say in the way their local community is run. It was felt that this would also allow the immigrants to feel more included in the local community and that this would be of benefit to the community as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We generally agree with the draft consensus statement, however, given the complexities involved with the issue of allowing immigrants to vote and the potential for abuse of the system, we thought that that the following extra conditions should apply. An immigrant should have lived in the UK for at least five years and should have a legal right to remain in the country. The immigrant will need to have studied at a local school for the five years, and he or she must be living in the local community for at least nine months of the year.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing immigrants to vote in local and national elections. It was agreed that the immigrants should have lived in the UK for a minimum of 5 years and have a legal right to remain in the UK. This would allow them to have a good understanding of the local and national issues and also to have contributed to the local community. It was felt that this would be a good way of integrating immigrants into the local community and also to allow them to have a say in the way their local community is run. This would mean that they can help build a good quality of life for themselves as well as their families. In addition, it was felt that this would be an additional way of showing the value of these immigrants as members of the community. This would help them feel a sense of belonging and increase their confidence. This would make them feel happier and safer in the UK which would also improve their quality of life and that of their families.
