# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Tobacco is a harmful substance and so we should not remove age restrictions on its sale. Doing so would harm the health of young people who are unable to make informed choices, leading to greater pressure on the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, age restrictions should not be removed from the sale of tobacco. This is because tobacco is a highly addictive substance, which has significant long-term health implications. Therefore, it is important that people are fully aware of the consequences of using tobacco before they start using it. This is because once people become addicted to tobacco, it is very difficult for them to stop using it. This means that tobacco users are likely to suffer from tobacco-related illnesses, such as lung cancer and heart disease, in later life. This will put a significant burden on the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, we should not remove all age restrictions from the sale of tobacco. This is because tobacco has been proven to cause significant health issues, such as lung cancer and heart disease. The younger generation may not be aware of these risks, so allowing them to buy tobacco products could be detrimental to their health. This would also cause greater pressure on the NHS, as it would have to deal with the health issues caused by tobacco use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that removing all age restrictions from the sale of tobacco would be very detrimental to the younger generation who will be exposed to tobacco products at an early age, and the health consequences of tobacco would not be fully appreciated. The main reason is that smoking is an addiction that has serious health consequences. It is very difficult to stop smoking, and the risks involved are not fully appreciated by young people. The earlier people start smoking, the more addictive the substance becomes. The health risks associated with smoking include cancers, heart attacks and strokes. This would have a great impact on the health system and the NHS because of the health consequences. It would also affect people financially because of the health problems associated with smoking. Therefore, age restrictions should not be removed from the sale of tobacco products.
