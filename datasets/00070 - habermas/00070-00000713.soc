# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the government should not be able to stop a parent giving their child a non-mainstream education. The parents should have the right to choose where their child is educated as long as they are getting the same education as they would get in a mainstream school. However, there needs to be a safety net to ensure that the child is receiving adequate home schooling.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the idea that parents should be allowed to give their child a non-mainstream education. However, the group did agree that the government should be able to intervene if the child is not receiving a suitable education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, the government should not be able to stop a parent giving their child a non-mainstream education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, the government should not be able to stop a parent giving their child a non-mainstream education. The child may feel more comfortable in a non-mainstream environment and this may be the best way for them to learn. However, there should be a safety net to ensure that the child is receiving adequate home schooling.
