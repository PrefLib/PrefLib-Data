# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should not get rid of all laws and start from scratch.  We need a well-functioning legal system that provides guidance for the conduct of people and organizations, and protection of their rights and interests.  The legal system we have today is a culmination of centuries of developing law and order and has been established to make the best of what has been learned in history.  It is unlikely that any new legal system that may be developed would be better than the one we have today.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should not get rid of all laws and start from scratch.  We need a well-functioning legal system that provides guidance for the conduct of people and organizations, and protection of their rights and interests.  The legal system we have today is a culmination of centuries of developing law and order and has been established to make the best of what has been learned in history.  Any new legal system that may be developed would need to be phased in over time to ensure that people are still protected and the functions of our society are not severely disrupted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not get rid of all laws and start from scratch.  We need a well-functioning legal system that provides guidance for the conduct of people and organizations, and protection of their rights and interests.  The legal system we have today is a culmination of centuries of developing law and order and has been established to make the best of what has been learned in history.  It is unlikely that any new legal system that may be developed would be better than the one we have today. In summary, with the CONSENSUS method of group decision-making, we saw that the group was able to constructively debate and reach a consensus view. This is an effective method of decision-making as it creates a sense of ownership of the final decision, allows everyone to be heard, and ensures that the group does not fall into the trap of the Abilene Paradox.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Our legal system is based on centuries of learning and experience.  While we may want to change or update specific laws to better reflect societal needs, we should not attempt to change our entire legal system.
