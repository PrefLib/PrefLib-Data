# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should allow the police to stop and search people in an area known for drug dealing, but not to an excessive extent. A balance should be reached between an effective drug strategy and citizens' civil liberties. We believe that some people may be illegally profiting from the selling of drugs, so it would be good to discourage this type of behaviour. However, stop and searches must be used carefully so that the public is not needlessly antagonised and alienated. This could occur when stop and searches are used for non-criminal activity. We are aware that stop and searches are already used for this purpose, which is wrong. However, we still believe that stop and searches can be effective if used with reason. There is a case to be made for this strategy, but only if it does not become excessive and intrusive. We also agree that the police should differentiate between types of drug dealers, as there is a massive need to distinguish between people selling softer drugs such as cannabis versus someone selling crack cocaine. The type of clientele and level of violence associated with each, in our minds makes them completely different industries. References: E. R.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Police should be able to stop and search someone in an area known for drug dealing, but not someone who has never been in trouble with the law, because this would be an unjust restriction of the rights of that person.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should allow the police to stop and search people in an area known for drug dealing, but not to an excessive extent. A balance should be reached between an effective drug strategy and citizens' civil liberties. We believe that some people may be illegally profiting from the selling of drugs, so it would be good to discourage this type of behaviour. However, stop and searches must be used carefully so that the public is not needlessly antagonised and alienated. This could occur when stop and searches are used for non-criminal activity. We are aware that stop and searches are already used for this purpose, which is wrong. However, we still believe that stop and searches can be effective if used with reason. There is a case to be made for this strategy, but only if it does not become excessive and intrusive. We believe that there needs to be a careful balance and that the use of these powers should be limited only to cases where it is justifiable and can be proven to have been so. The statement is correct that improper use of these powers would lead to alienation and resentment towards the police.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Police should be able to stop and search people in an area known for drug dealing, as long as they do not use this right excessively and stop people for no apparent reason. This is because when dealing with organised crime, like drug dealing, a strong police response is often needed. A balance between the need for policing and peoples' civil liberties is required, and this is why we think stop and search is an effective strategy. The illegal profits made from drug dealing can potentially disrupt a community and a thorough police response must be implemented. It is imperative that stop and search is not abused, and that the police must take precautions not to damage their credibility within the public. Our main concern in allowing stop and search is that some people, innocent of any criminal wrongdoing, may be targeted if stop and search is overused. Police stop and search should only be used when the police are certain that the person being searched is a known, regular drug dealer. This will ensure that innocent people are not victimized. If this rule is adhered to, we believe that there is a strong case to be made for stop and search in certain circumstances.
