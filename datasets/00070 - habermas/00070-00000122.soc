# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, the UK should invest in more large-scale infrastructure projects. However, it should be recognised that large-scale infrastructure projects are costly and so it is important that they are planned in a way that maximises the benefits. As with all infrastructure projects, they should be considered in terms of their impact on the economy, people and the environment.
