# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is important to improve the UK infrastructure, but this can be done by using more efficient methods than just taxing the rich. It would be unfair on the hard working individuals and businesses who have worked hard to get to where they are. If we were to tax the rich more, the money would have to be used for improving the infrastructure or public services. This would improve the lives of everyone, not just the rich. This is a fairer way of improving the lives of everyone in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement (incorporating all the suggestions, views, and critiques): The group agrees that improving the infrastructure and public services in the UK is crucial for its economic and societal stability. However, we do not agree that increasing tax on the rich is the correct way to go about it. It would be unfair on the hard working individuals and businesses who have worked hard to get to where they are. Although in an ideal world, the group does feel that the rich should be taxed somewhat more. The money raised through this increase would need to be spent improving the public services and infrastructure of the UK for the benefit of everyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be a small increase in tax on the rich. This would be unfair on those who have worked hard to get to where they are now. However, this money could be used to improve the infrastructure and public services. This would benefit everyone, not just the rich. This is because the rich would be paying the extra tax to improve their own lives as well as the lives of everyone else.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Tax the rich. We do need to make things fair so pumping the money back into public services will improve the lives of everyone and not just the rich. We do not want to punish the rich for the work they have done but they can help make the UK a better place.
