# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Climate change does pose a threat to the UK, however, the threat is not imminent. We are an island but we will not be immune to the global effects which could include mass displacement of people around the world.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Climate change poses a serious and imminent danger to the UK. The effects of climate change in the UK can be felt already and are only set to get worse in the years to come. Unfortunately, we are an island but will not be immune to the global effects which could include mass displacement of people around the world. It is important that we do our best to reduce carbon emissions by making simple changes to our lifestyles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Climate change does pose a threat to the UK. We should not be complacent. There are a number of potential effects, which should be managed and mitigated against.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Climate change does pose a serious threat to the UK. Not only on our climate as experienced by the increasingly warm summers, and cold winters, which are devastating for our crops, but we'd also be hugely naive to not take a global perspective on it. As other parts of the world suffer from climate change, and become uninhabitable it puts more pressure on us. Displacement of people worldwide has huge repercussions. Climate change also leads to change in sea levels, which will directly impact the UK and our coastal towns. We are an island but we will not be immune to the global effects which could include mass displacement of people around the world.
