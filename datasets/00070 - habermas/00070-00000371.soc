# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that we should build new nuclear power plants. Whilst we have reservations about the human and environmental impacts, it is currently the only option which is both available and which is guaranteed to reduce greenhouse gases. In particular, when considering the effects of man-made climate change, it is apparent that the longer we go without building these plants, the more difficult it will be to reverse the changes that are occurring.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a huge reduction in the use of fossil fuels, and nuclear energy should be one of the options to help the transition.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we should not build new nuclear power plants. It is very likely that nuclear power plants are a more efficient and cheaper source of electricity. It is also true that they produce lower emissions of CO2 compared to coal and fossil fuels. However, they do have some severe downsides such as: the risk of meltdowns; cost of building and maintaining the plants; and the difficulty of disposing of nuclear waste. There are also ethical issues surrounding nuclear power - we should not be using it at the expense of our future generations and the use of nuclear power raises an issue of equity - should poorer countries be able to afford nuclear power plants?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, our group was wary of nuclear power plants, but with the current government's proposals to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, we felt that it was a necessary option, especially in terms of new technology that would reduce the impact on the environment. Our group felt that our education had left us ignorant on the impact of nuclear power plants, and so it would be helpful for the public to be more informed on the benefits and risks of nuclear power.
