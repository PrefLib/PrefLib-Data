# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that it is not ethical to cut down ancient forests in order to grow food for humans.  The ancient forests have been around for thousands of years and are a part of our history.  The ancient forests are also home to many different species of animals and plants and if we were to cut them down, many of these species would become extinct.  The ancient forests also help to keep our air clean and if we were to cut them down, the air quality would become worse and this would have a negative impact on our health.  There are many other places that we could grow food, and therefore we should not cut down the ancient forests.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is not ethical to cut down ancient forests in order to grow food for humans. It is very important that we conserve our natural resources so that future generations have the opportunity to enjoy them and for us to be able to continue to enjoy them. There are other places where humans can grow food and we should look at alternatives for growing food so that ancient forests do not have to be destroyed.  It is important that we explore other means of food production so that the natural balance is maintained.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is not ethical to cut down ancient forests. The ancient trees are there for future generations and as well as us, to enjoy and explore. Ancient forests are often beautiful and if cut down would look terrible. Humans need food but it is not worth it to cut down forests for that. The human race will survive without having to cut down forests and therefore it is best to leave them alone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to cutting down ancient forests to grow food for humans. The group felt that humans had other options and that cutting down ancient forests was an extremely violent act towards the environment. The group also felt that alternatives to ensure that ancient forests weren't cut down should be explored.
