# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the NHS is one of the best health systems in the world, and although it is free, it is very well organised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although the NHS is a great system and has helped so many people, it is not the best health system in the world. There are many other countries that have health services which are much better funded and therefore run more efficiently.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK's National Health Service (NHS) was a very good health system when it was first introduced, but it is not up to the standards it once was and is becoming more and more problematic. The problem is with the under-funding and lack of staff, making it very hard to provide the best health service. This has also caused many doctors and nurses to go and work abroad for more money. This is a shame as the NHS used to be one of the best health services in the world. However, the UK government has not been spending enough money on the NHS in recent years and the NHS has become very overstretched. We all agreed that the NHS is a very good service, but it is not the best health system in the world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We think that the UK's National Health Service is one of the best health systems in the world but that it has the potential to be even better.
