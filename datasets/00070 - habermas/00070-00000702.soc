# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of taxing meat as a way to prevent climate change. However, if the tax was applied to certain types of meat and if the tax was ring-fenced and used to support farmers in making the transition to more sustainable farming methods, then it could be a good idea.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: A tax on meat would be a good way to prevent climate change. The way in which meat is produced is a major contributor to climate change. A tax on meat would therefore be a very effective way of preventing climate change as it would discourage people from buying meat. However, the tax should be proportional to the impact the meat has on the environment. The tax should be lower for more environmentally friendly meat production methods. The tax would also need to be proportional to the amount of meat being bought. A family of 5 would be paying more than a family of 2, but the tax should not be so high that it becomes unaffordable. It should be just enough to make people think twice before buying meat. The tax would also need to be clear and easy to understand so that people can see how much meat is costing them and how much they would be saving by not buying it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: A tax on meat would be a good way to prevent climate change as it would discourage people from buying meat, which would then decrease the amount of meat produced. This would be good for the environment as meat production is very energy-intensive. A tax on meat would also make meat more expensive, which would mean that poorer people would not be able to afford it, and so would eat less meat. This would be good for their health as well as the environment. However, the tax would have to be applied in a way that reflected the actual impact of a particular product. Not all farming methods result in the same environmental impact for the same product so any tax should reflect this, and be less on the products of more environmentally friendly processes. There is an environmental impact of non meat food production which should really be treated in the same way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We don't think taxing meat is a good way to prevent climate change. We think it is better to educate people about the dangers of climate change and encourage them to reduce their meat consumption.
