# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The spread of mobile technology has improved the quality of people's social lives because it allows you to stay connected to friends and family in a quick, easy way. It also allows you to stay connected to people who have the same interests and hobbies as you which can help expand your social life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the spread of mobile technology has had a positive impact on the quality of people's social lives. It has improved quality of life because it gives a person a view of all the people of the world, and connects people with the same interests who might not live close and otherwise wouldn't be able to interact. However, mobile technology has allowed the world to become more social and contact anyone anywhere at any time but it has some damaging effects for people trying to be "Popular" or keep up a large online presence. Also allowing people to be so connected has made bullying much worse and allowing criminals to communicate easier. No discussion of technology in society is complete without a discussion of ethics. Ethics is concerned with what we should or should not do, what is right and what is wrong. Below are presented a series of ethical dilemmas, some of which may be familiar to you. Each dilemma is presented with a question about the dilemma.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We have come to the conclusion that the spread of mobile technology has both good and bad effects on people's social lives. On the good side, people are now able to contact others from all around the world at any time. On the bad side, social media has led to a rise in cyber bullying and it has allowed people to become too involved in their online presence rather than their real life presence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The spread of mobile technology has improved the quality of people's social lives by allowing people to easily connect and organise social events and activities. However, this new ability to organise social activities and events has also made it easier for people to become less social by allowing them to stay in their home and talk to people through their phones.
