# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should allow for the commercial sale of cannabis as this would take the revenue away from organised crime, reduce the sale of fake/bad quality products and generate tax revenues which can be used to provide a greater variety of treatment options for the NHS, to invest in prison reform, to provide drug education and training to those at risk of addiction.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, for the reasons already mentioned. The arguments against are people’s personal distaste for the drug, however there are many more arguments in favour. The potential benefits to the NHS in terms of new treatments and the benefits of the revenue for the government are enough to counter these arguments. The issue of taxation was something the group did not touch on but it would have been something to include in the debate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The sale of cannabis should be allowed in the UK.  The sale of cannabis will reduce crime, and the sale of cannabis will create an extra revenue stream for the government.  The sale of cannabis would help to create an open dialogue about the health effects of drugs, and the sale of cannabis would also allow for the regulation of the cannabis market.  The sale of cannabis will help to alleviate some of the pain associated with certain illnesses, and the sale of cannabis will help to reduce the illicit market.  The sale of cannabis will allow people to use cannabis in a safe and controlled environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should legalise the sale of cannabis, for recreational purposes, because: 1)      It can be done successfully and already has been done in a number of states in the USA. 2)      The recreational use of cannabis is not harmful and the drug itself has medicinal properties that can be used to help treat a number of conditions. 3)      The illegal sale of cannabis currently means that the market is controlled by gangs and criminal elements, legalisation would remove this and also remove a source of revenue for these gangs. 4)      The legalisation of the drug would be likely to reduce its use in the longer term. 5)      Currently the UK has very high rates of cannabis use and is likely to increase, as use in other countries has increased with legalisation. It makes sense to legalise it in the UK as a result.
