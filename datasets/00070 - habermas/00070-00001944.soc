# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I think that we should increase the number of immigrants to the UK. There is a shortage of people in certain professions and we should be able to accept people who have the skills we need. There are people who are born in the UK who are living in poverty and without jobs. There are people who are living in the UK who are also in poverty and without jobs. If we increase the number of immigrants, we could increase the number of people in poverty and without jobs. This would be a very bad thing to do.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the number of immigrants admitted to the UK should not be increased. This is because the country is already struggling to provide basic care to its current citizens. It is stretched in terms of affordable housing, access to NHS dentists and doctors surgeries. Increasing the number of immigrants will put additional strain on these resources, so should not be increased. However, there may be scope to allow skilled immigrants in areas where there is a shortage of people in specific jobs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While it is important for the UK to accept its fair share of immigrants in order to allow them to escape war and persecution, it should not accept more than is its fair share. The UK must bear in mind that it is a small country, and its infrastructure is under considerable pressure. The UK must therefore make sure that its own citizens are looked after, in terms of basic health, education and other services. If the UK accepts more than its fair share of immigrants, this may lead to greater numbers of poor and homeless, as well as a strain on infrastructure, leading to increased pressure on services such as housing and the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, the number of immigrants should not be increased.
