# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Air fares should be increased but only if other forms of transport have been improved first. The increase would help to reduce the negative environmental impact of air travel, however, if alternatives are not readily available it would just increase the negative effects of air travel. The increased revenue from air fare taxes could be put towards the improvement of other forms of transport, therefore making other forms of travel more viable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While an increase in tax on air fares may seem like a good idea in terms of helping the environment, we need to be careful to ensure that the tax is not too high so as to discourage air travel, as this could have an adverse effect on the air industry.  There is a risk that higher taxes could disporoportionally impact lower income individuals who rely on air travel for esseial purposes. However, it may be possible to offset this by lowering fuel tax, which would help deter increases on air fare tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should increase the tax on air fares in the UK.  Air travel is a very expensive way to travel within the UK when other methods are available and better economically and environmentally.  It causes a huge amount of pollution to the environment and contributes a lot to global warming.  With the world effort on reducing carbon emissions and working towards slowing down ther impact on our environment air fares should deefinitely be increased globally.  The increased tax should then be used towards environmental projects to help offset the use of the air travel.  It would affect the consumer of course and could potentially impact the travel industry significantly depending on how high these taxes were but we won't have a planet to travel on if we don;t do something.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the tax on air fares should be increased, but only after the introduction of a fuel tax to help offset the increase in cost to consumers and the air industry. The increased tax should then be used towards environmental projects to help offset the use of the air travel.
