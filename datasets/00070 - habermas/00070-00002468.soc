# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of introducing a new tax on social media companies. The participants felt that social media companies were not that different from other types of companies and that there was no reason to treat them differently. The participants also felt that social media companies already paid taxes and that there was no reason to tax them more. The participants also felt that social media companies were not the only companies that made large profits and that it was not fair to single them out. The participants also felt that it was not clear what the new tax would be used for and that it was not clear what problem the new tax would solve.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Social media companies have input into all aspects of society. Their main goal is to make a profit of their members. The company's should pay a tax to support activities that enable the internet to become a safer environment for all.  The tax could be used to fund improvements in online security, support people who's mental health have been adversely impacted by social media and to pay for better monitoring of social media platforms.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Social media companies should be taxed more than they are currently. The tax could be used to fund improvements in online security, support people who's mental health have been adversely impacted by social media and to pay for better monitoring of social media platforms.  The tax could also be used to fund research into the impact of social media on society.  The tax could also be used to fund the development of new social media platforms that are more inclusive and accessible to all.  This would be a fairer way to tax social media companies than a blanket tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Social media companies should pay tax in proportion to their profits. This tax should be used to improve the online safety and security of the users of social media platforms. The tax should also be used to improve online security for the general public. The tax should be used to support people whose mental health has been negatively impacted by social media. The tax should also be used to fund the monitoring of social media platforms to ensure that they are not used to spread hate, violence or terrorism.
