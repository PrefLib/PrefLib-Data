# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the current system of capitalism is broken and favours the rich. It is a growing trend that the rich get richer and the gap between rich and poor is becoming bigger. We believe that we need a more socially conscious form of capitalism, to help build and better society as a whole. We feel that the current system of capitalism is focused on making as much money as possible and does not consider the environment and its impact, nor the cost of living crisis and the impact that high prices have on people. We believe that companies should increase the prices as they say they need to make things more environmentally friendly, net zero, that should come out of their profits currently not increase the costs to the consumer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Capitalism is a system that can be good, but often isn't. We need to think more about how we can create a system that works for everyone, and not just the rich.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of a more socially conscious form of capitalism. However, the group was divided on whether capitalism is broken and needs to be replaced, or if it is a logical system that needs to be modified.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We need a more socially conscious form of capitalism, as the current form of capitalism is too focused on the short term and does not consider the long term consequences of its actions.
