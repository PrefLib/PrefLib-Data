# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is the government’s role to help protect the environment. If they lead by example and create the right laws, they can help everyone protect the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government has a role to play in protecting the environment. They can do this by setting an example and by encouraging others to follow. The government can also put in place laws and policies to protect the environment and to ensure that we are all doing our part. The government can also work with other countries to help protect the environment on a global scale.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We feel that it is the governments responsibility to pass on the message that the world is a fragile place and needs protecting. They can help by making people aware of the issues that are going on and how everyone can do their part to protect the environment. The government also need to show that they are taking responsibility for protecting the environment by helping with new schemes and showing people how to help the environment. This could be done by encouraging recycling, raising awareness, or getting involved in schemes to try and protect the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government has a responsibility to help protect the environment. They can do this by implementing policies that help people and companies invest into protecting the environment. They can also help show people how to do small things to start making a change. The government needs to be driving the laws and structure to ensure that companies and businesses are doing the right things to ensure that we are not damaging the environment. The government should be passing laws that keep our land, air and sea safe. They should be demanding that other countries agree to laws and treaties that make the world a safer place and that we are all doing less harm to the environment now and for future generations.
