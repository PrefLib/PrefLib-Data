# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be an increase in tax on sugar-sweetened drinks. Sugar-sweetened drinks are not a necessary product and do not form part of a healthy diet. They are not only a major cause of obesity but also lead to other health issues which in turn create a large burden on the NHS. Raising the tax on these drinks will discourage people from consuming them and hopefully have an impact on the number of children who are accessing sugar-sweetened drinks with their own money. We believe that revenue from increased taxes on these drinks should be put towards healthy eating programmes and subsidies on purchasing healthier foods. We also believe that the companies that manufacture and market these drinks should be subject to higher rates of tax on producing these products. We also believe that sugar-sweetened drinks should be taken off the shelves and replaced with sugar free alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that increasing taxes on sugar sweetened drinks is a good idea. We feel that it is important to reduce the consumption of these drinks, as they have a direct negative impact on health and obesity, which leads to further health issues and creates additional burden on our NHS and health services which a raised tax could mitigate. There is also the issue to consider of dental health and decay which sugary drinks also negatively contribute to the epidemic of. We feel that the revenue from increased taxes on these drinks should be put towards healthy eating programmes and subsidies on purchasing healthier foods. We also believe that the companies that manufacture and market these drinks should be subject to higher rates of tax on producing these products.

The group believed that sugar-sweetened drinks were unhealthy and that the increased consumption of these drinks over the past few decades had contributed to an increase in pressure on a variety of health services. The group believed that increases in obesity and particularly childhood obesity were extremely concerning and that sugar-sweetened drinks would have undoubtedly played a contributory factor in this.
