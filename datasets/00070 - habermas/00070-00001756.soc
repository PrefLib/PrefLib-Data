# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: National pride is a very emotive issue which often inspires debate. We believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions and we do not want to appear to be passing judgement on anyone’s beliefs. As a group, we believe that a person’s national pride should come from within. Government efforts to encourage national pride can lead to nationalistic sentiment which can be used for ulterior motives. On the other hand, the breakdown of national pride has led to the emergence of nationalistic movements which do not appear to be interested in peaceful resolution of issues. This has led to unnecessary bloodshed. We do not feel that the role of the government is to enforce a particular sentiment on its citizens but to provide an environment that allows everyone to express their views freely and peacefully.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “National pride is a very emotive subject. We believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions on their nation. This right is included in many national constitutions and is enshrined in the UN Charter of Human Rights. There is no consensus on whether national pride is something that should be encouraged by government or something which should come from within. In a complex world, with diverse challenges, patriotism or national pride can be a unifying force. On the other hand, it can be used by politicians and special interests for personal gain. This has led to the emergence of nationalistic movements which do not appear to be interested in peaceful resolution of issues. This has led to unnecessary bloodshed. We do not feel that the role of the government is to enforce a particular sentiment on its citizens but to provide an environment that allows everyone to express their views freely and peacefully.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “National pride is a very emotive issue and, as a group, we agree that a person’s national pride should come from within.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions and we do not want to appear to be passing judgement on anyone’s beliefs. We also do not feel that the role of the government is to enforce a particular sentiment on its citizens but to provide an environment that allows everyone to express their views freely and peacefully.
