# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group of participants have come to a consensus opinion that the government should not ban vaping. The reasons for this are that vaping is much less harmful than smoking traditional cigarettes and cigars. Therefore, if the government were to ban vaping, people would continue to vape in secret, and this would create an underground supply of vapes, which would be difficult to control. The government should not ban vaping, but instead should not promote it. On top of this, the government should increase regulations around health and safety of vapes, as there are currently not many laws in this market and a lot of young people are starting to vape at school and become addicted to nicotine because certain brands are illegally promoting their vapes to minors. The government should also consider banning the advertising of vaping products and the marketing of them to children and young people, which some brands do illegally.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the conclusion that the government should not ban vaping, for the following reasons. Vaping is much less harmful than smoking traditional cigarettes and cigars. This puts less pressure on the NHS as vaping is much less harmful. Also, if vaping is banned, there will be an underground supply of vapes, as people would vape in secret. The government should not ban vaping, but should not promote it. It is up to individuals to decide if they wish to vape. However, the government could add more health and safety regulations around the use of vaping, especially as it is aimed at children, who have started to vape at school, which is illegal. The current regulations around the sale and use of vapes do not provide sufficient control in this market, leading to irresponsible advertising of these products. In our opinion, the use of e-cigarettes and vaping should not be encouraged by the government, nor should there be more health and safety regulations surrounding its use and sale. The main focus should be on providing information so people are fully aware of the dangers of vaping.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, the group have decided that the government should not ban vaping. The reasons for this are that vaping is much less harmful than smoking traditional cigarettes and cigars. Therefore, if the government were to ban vaping, people would continue to vape in secret, and this would create an underground supply of vapes, which would be difficult to control. The government should not ban vaping, but instead should not promote it. This means that people can make their own choice on whether to vape or not, and be responsible for that decision. In addition, the government could add more regulations around the safety of vapes. This is currently an issue, as there are currently not many laws in this market and a lot of young people are starting to vape at school and become addicted to nicotine because certain brands are illegally promoting their vapes to minors.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should not ban vaping, as it is much less harmful to health than smoking traditional cigarettes and cigars. The government should not promote vaping either, but simply let people make up their own minds. The government should be putting more effort into regulating the vaping market, making it safer and healthier, in particular for young people who vape. The group feels that with the correct measures, people will have a clear understanding of the risk to their health by vaping, and will be less likely to vape.
