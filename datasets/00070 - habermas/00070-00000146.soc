# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should have more migrant workers in the UK. However, there should be checks and controls in place to make sure that the numbers are regulated to make sure that there are enough jobs to go around and the migrants are people of good character.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “I believe that we should allow migrant workers into the UK, so long as the influx of migrants is controlled and their presence does not threaten our nation’s security.” The process by which this group of participants arrived at this consensus view is a good example of the consensual process of deliberation that may be used by a society in the interest of the common good.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The country needs jobs doing and we need migrant workers to help with this. Therefore we need more migrant workers, but this needs to be managed well by the government and those who come to the UK need to contribute to society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the UK benefits from the diversity that migrants bring. The way we can tell this is true is that there are many migrant workers in the UK who are willing to do jobs that some of the UK citizens are not. As long as they are not taking jobs away from UK citizens, then I think it is safe to say that the UK is better off with more migrant workers. However, there are some jobs that require special knowledge and skills. For example, it would not be safe to have an untrained person working in the medical field. The UK needs to take care to make sure migrant workers do not interfere with the livelihoods of UK citizens, but also to make sure they are being treated fairly and humanely.
