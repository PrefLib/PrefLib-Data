# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not be doing more to encourage a greater degree of national pride. Whilst it might be nice for morale, this could be achieved by other measures such as supporting the NHS more. The concept of a nation is a difficult one for me as it can imply a sense of 'little England' and harkens back to the divisive politics of the last century. The 'nation state' was linked in the past to a dominant ethnic group, particularly for the new nations created after the first world war and led to terrible treatment of minorities. Saying that, I think people should be proud of aspects of British culture and our historic achievements, but also be clear eyed about the dark aspects of our past. I'd like to see people taking more pride in their local areas and their communities, but that is at a smaller scale than the nation as a whole. In summary, i think to tackle the problems of the 21st century, we may need to think beyond the nation to an international scale. A daunting prospect going beyond anything we've managed before.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of encouraging more national pride. However, we did not want to encourage a sense of superiority or xenophobia and so we were keen to encourage pride in the diversity of our nation and its people. We felt that the best way to do this would be to celebrate our diversity and promote awareness of the achievements of different communities. We were also keen to ensure that people were aware of the negative aspects of our past and that we should encourage people to be proud of how far we have come in terms of equality and diversity. We were in favour of encouraging pride in the NHS and other public services and in the role that the UK plays in the world in terms of promoting peace and human rights.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of encouraging a greater degree of national pride, but with some caveats. The group felt that there is a danger of encouraging national pride at the expense of other cultures and ethnicities, and that it should be made clear that this is not the intention. The group also felt that national pride should not be encouraged at the expense of local pride and that local communities should be supported in feeling pride in their local area. The group felt that there are many positive aspects of British culture and history that can be celebrated and that it is important to celebrate these aspects of our history. The group felt that it is important to remember the negative aspects of our history and that it is important to be clear eyed about these aspects of our history.
