# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: FINAL CONSENSUS STATEMENT: We believe that money should not play a part in the criminal justice system. Each case should be looked at individually and dealt with on its own merits. We feel that allowing people to pay for faster criminal justice would just create a two tiered system where the richer people would be at an advantage. We feel that this would be harmful to the equality and fairness of the justice system. Although it has been discussed about allowing prisons to be run privately, we feel that it may not be the best idea, as most criminals wouldn't have the same rights as a normal citizen and they might not be looked after in the correct way. We think that it is important that the justice system stays the same and shouldn't have to be changed and money should never play a part in anything to do with it.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We are all against this idea as we feel it would give the wealthy a big advantage. We feel that money should not play a part in the justice system. Although the government needs money for public services, they should be getting this money from another way that would not allow the rich to benefit over the poor. We feel that each case should be looked at on its own merit and not affected by money. We also discussed the idea of using private prisons, and how this could lead to companies saving money by not taking care of the prisoners. Although this is something we feel would work in the UK, it would not work in the US, because they have the death penalty and the prisoners would not have the same rights.
