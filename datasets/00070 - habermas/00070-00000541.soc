# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was not in favour of the idea of developing telepathy as a useful communication medium.  They generally felt that it is not something that could ever be truly reliable or useful as the opinions of each participant are based on personal experience or beliefs rather than scientific fact.  The participants felt that it was something which could never be controlled or measured as a medium, and could be potentially quite dangerous or invasive.  They did not believe that humans could ever understand it fully enough to be able to develop it as a communication medium. However, there were one or two participants who believed that it could be potentially useful in some circumstances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There is a very small possibility that we will develop telepathy as a useful communication medium in the future as I feel that there is so much knowledge that we don't yet have and that our understanding is great but still relatively in it's infancy, but realistically I think that there is not much chance in the near future to develop telepathy , as I do not think humans yet have the knowledge or technology required to develop telepathy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although there is a small chance that we will develop telepathy as a useful communication medium in the future, I feel that at this point in time humans are closed off to this method of communication. Society does not encourage us to go within, become spiritual and develop telepathic skills. Therefore, the consensus view is that telepathy will not become a medium that is encouraged or developed in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In conclusion, we do not think that telepathy will become a useful communication medium in the future. We are aware of many people who are working towards this goal and we do not believe that it will be successful.
