# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People should be allowed to vote at 16, however they should be educated on the voting process and the importance of voting. This will help them to make the right decision when they vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “We have debated the topic for a long time and come to the conclusion that it would be a bad idea for people to vote at 16. We have made this decision as we feel that 16 year olds would not be able to vote with their own minds and would be influenced by their parents and their teachers. We feel that 16 year olds would not be mature enough to vote and that their opinions would not be as strong as those of people older than them. We have also made this decision as 16 year olds have to be in full time education and are therefore unlikely to be working, which may lead to them being unable to understand the full effects of the economy. For example, we feel that the higher rates of tuition fees will have little impact on the 16 year olds who are unlikely to have experienced working for long enough to fully appreciate the effects of tuition fees.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People should be allowed to vote at 16 as they are becoming young adults and will be affected by the decisions that are made. However, they should be made to sit a test on their knowledge of the political world and their level of maturity to ensure they are not influenced by others and that they are able to make their own decisions.
