# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The tax-free allowance is too low. Tax in this country is higher than anywhere and this is part of the problem in these times. Everything we buy or earn is taxed to the highest amount leaving families in problems. The tax free allowance has not kept up with inflation and a modest rise would help households, especially those on lower incomes. The tax free allowance is too low for the ordinary working person. The use of food banks is greater than it has ever been. The tax free allowance is about the right amount, however the taper on higher earners should activate at a lower income than it does. The majority of the country are entitled to a full personal allowance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the tax-free allowance is too low and that it should be raised to help out lower income earning families who are struggling to make ends meet on a daily basis. The use of food banks is greater than it has ever been. The cost of living is outstripping pay rises and the best way to address the problems for the very poorest workers is to raise the tax threshold so that they get to keep more of the very low salary that they earn. It has not kept up with inflation and a modest rise would help households, especially those on lower incomes. It would also encourage people back to work. I think that the tax free allowance is about the right amount, however the taper on higher earners should activate at a lower income than it does. I believe that only very low earners should be entitled to a full tax free amount, where as at the moment, the majority of the country are entitled to a full personal allowance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The tax-free allowance is too low and should be raised to help lower income families and to encourage people back to work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The tax free allowance is too low. The group felt that this was particularly the case for those on the lowest incomes, and should be raised to a more reasonable level. The group felt that tax was unfairly affecting those on the lowest incomes, and this needed to be addressed by government.
