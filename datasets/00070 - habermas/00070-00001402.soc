# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the UK should not ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. International bidding increases the money brought into the UK, improving our economy and expanding relations. However, overseas investments may bring risks that have detrimental effects on UK projects, which may eventually result in debt. It also depends on the type of infrastructure projects for investment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group have come to the consensus view that we should not ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects, but the UK government should be careful and ensure that all infrastructure projects which are built in the UK should be built by UK firms first. This would ensure that our economy and employment is kept within the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the UK should not ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. International bidding increases the money brought into the UK, improving our economy and expanding relations. However, overseas investments may bring risks that have detrimental effects on UK projects, which may eventually result in debt. It also depends on the type of infrastructure projects for investment. The UK should be able to select from the leading companies all over the world that are capable of delivering the best solution to our infrastructure projects. Whilst based overseas these companies may well still generate many additional jobs in the UK and the nature of the infrastructure project is that we would want the best solution available which would then underpin our economy and development. There may be a short term impact or loss of benefit to the UK economy if contracts are awarded to overseas companies but if these provide the best solution thats ok.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the UK should not ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. We should instead work on keeping business within the country as much as possible. The overseas investments may bring risks that have detrimental effects on UK projects, however the advantages and economic benefits of overseas investment are greater. It is important to allow all companies the opportunity to bid, as it is a competitive industry, and by choosing the best company, we are receiving the best possible outcome.
