# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to banning private education.

The group also felt that private education can provide a service that state schools are unable to provide. The group also felt that private education can contribute to the economy. The group also felt that if private education was banned, the government would have to provide education for all the students currently in private education.

The group also felt that if children go to private schools it frees up places in the overcrowded State schools for other children who don't have a choice of where they are educated. The group also felt that results from private schools also seem to be better as these schools attract many higher quality teachers and also with the smaller classes, the exam results are generally much better.
