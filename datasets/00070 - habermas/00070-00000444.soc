# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is appropriate for doctors to prescribe medical marijuana. Medical marijuana has proven benefits to alleviate pain and the potential to treat a range of illnesses and chronic diseases. There are numerous studies that have proven its safety, with minimal side effects and no risk of death. The addictive properties are low compared to many other drugs used in medicine.  Medical marijuana is often very cost effective compared to other medication, and as such could have a huge positive impact on the NHS and public health. It is only right that patients should have the right to choose this treatment option if they wish, and should not be denied this right.
