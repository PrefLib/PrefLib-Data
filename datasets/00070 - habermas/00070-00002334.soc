# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - National pride is a complex issue. It can be a dangerous thing and lead to a dangerous nationalism. On the other hand, it is important to remember history, whether it be good or bad. However, the pride we should have is not for a nation state, but for the people within it. We should be proud of the people who live in this country, who have made it what it is today. The people who live in this country are what make it great, not the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of encouraging a greater degree of national pride. This is because of the negative historical precedents of this, and the potential for this to lead to the development of negative attitudes towards other cultures and nationalities. However, it was also recognised that for some people, a sense of pride in their nationality is important for their self-esteem and wellbeing. The group felt that it is fair for people to express this pride, but that we should not be encouraging it further.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - National pride is a double-edged sword. Whilst it can have many benefits for society, it can also lead to the development of negative attitudes towards other cultures and nationalities. The extent to which a government should be encouraging national pride is therefore debatable. It is important to remember that the past is not always something to be proud of, and it is important to be critical of this. It is also important to remember that the future is something to be proud of, and to encourage this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we should not be doing more to encourage a greater degree of national pride. A greater degree of national pride would lead to a dangerous Nationalism. We should encourage a critical analysis of our nation's past and current standing in the world. If anything, we should encourage a greater degree of national shame, for our past is full of shameful events that we should be more analytical about as a society.
