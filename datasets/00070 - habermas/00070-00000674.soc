# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - A universal basic income is needed in order to provide a safety net for people who may be unemployed in the future due to the rise of AI.  The current welfare system is not fit for purpose and is often very punitive and disempowering.  A universal basic income would provide a safety net for people in times of need and also remove the need to constantly monitor the income and employment status of people on benefits.  A universal basic income would also provide a basic income for people in work, but who are living in poverty.  A universal basic income would also provide a basic income for people with health conditions who are unable to work.  A universal basic income would provide a basic income for people who are unable to work due to caring for family members.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In principle, the idea of a universal basic income is very attractive, as it could provide an income to those who are currently locked out of the benefits system and would provide stability and security to those who are struggling to make ends meet. However, it is important to consider how it could be implemented and the costs involved. The consensus view of the group is that there should be a wide-scale trial of the concept to see how it could be implemented in practice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should move to a universal basic income as it would be a more effective way to combat poverty, it would support people whose jobs are at risk of the rise of AI, especially in the service industry. It would also support those with health conditions who cannot work, and it would level the playing field of how class impacts people's lives currently. It would also be a more effective way to support people in low paid work, especially in the service industry.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of a universal basic income.  It was felt that the current system is overly bureaucratic, inefficient and discriminatory.  It was also felt that the current system does not provide enough to live on and is too restrictive.  It was felt that a universal basic income would be a more efficient and fairer way of providing support for people who need it.  However, it was also felt that a universal basic income could lead to a reduction in the incentive to work.  This could be overcome by gradually reducing the basic income as people start to earn more.  This would provide an incentive to work.  The universal basic income would need to be funded by increased taxation, especially for the higher paid.  This would help to reduce inequality.
