# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “After a debate that was made interesting by several participants, we all agree that those making over £1 million a year should be taxed at a higher rate. In order to help reduce the massive gap between rich and poor people. People on low incomes should pay less taxes and people on high incomes should pay more taxes. In order to reduce the large budget deficit, we all agree that we must start somewhere, and that is taxing the people who have a large amount of wealth and can easily afford to pay more taxes. Although, we do agree that the taxes should be used to reduce the disparity between rich and poor, and that the government should raise peoples salaries instead to ensure those that live in poverty have a salary that they can comfortable survive from.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “In the United Kingdom, there is a wide gap between rich and poor people. We believe that one way to reduce this gap would be to raise taxes on high earners and use this to provide greater support to those living in poverty. Taxing the rich would also help to reduce the large budget deficit. This deficit is hurting the UK economy, making it harder for those living in poverty to climb the economic ladder. The rich can afford to pay more and would suffer little inconvenience as a result. A government that invests in the poor would not only be helping the most vulnerable members of society but would also be making the country a better place for everyone to live.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “After a very interesting debate in which many people made their opinions known, we all agree that those making over £1 million a year should be taxed at a higher rate in order to reduce the massive gap between rich and poor people. In particular, the richest people in the country should contribute more money, through higher taxes, so that government spending can be targetted at the poorest people in the country, helping to ensure they have enough to live on.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK is a country that has an extremely high rate of income inequality. People on low incomes should pay less tax and people on high incomes should pay more tax. In addition to this, more government spending on people on low incomes could help them to have a more equal chance at a decent standard of living. People who make over £1 million a year should be taxed at a higher rate to help fund such spending. In addition, people who make over £1 million a year could more easily afford such an increase in tax than people on low incomes who struggle to make ends meet already. Raising the tax on high earners would reduce the gap between rich and poor and give the poorest in society a better chance at a decent life.
