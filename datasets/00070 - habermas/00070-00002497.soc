# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the use of animals in scientific research is abhorrent.  The use of animals in cosmetic testing and in other areas of scientific research that do not have the potential to save human life should be banned.  The use of animals in scientific research that has the potential to save human life is more difficult to justify, but in some circumstances the use of animals may be the only way to make progress in the fight against disease.  In these circumstances, the use of animals should be minimised as much as possible and should only be used as a last resort.  The animals should be treated humanely and with respect.  Computer models should be used as an alternative to the use of animals wherever possible, and skin grafts and cells should be used as an alternative to the use of animals in medical research wherever possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the use of animals in scientific research is abhorrent.  We believe that we should try to use alternatives whenever possible.  Some animals, such as mice, are similar enough to humans to make them useful for studying human diseases and physiology.  We believe that we should use these animals only when we have no other options and that we should use the minimum number of animals necessary to get the information we need.  We also believe that we should treat the animals as humanely as possible and that we should not use endangered species in our research.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, animals should not be used in scientific research.  We believe that animals should be respected and given the opportunity to live a high quality life of their own without interference by mankind.  Animals should be used in scientific research only as a last resort.  If it is possible to use them humanely, that would be ideal but seems unlikely.  We believe that enough scientific progress has been made to be able to research without killing other animals.  Skin grafts and cells can be used to experiment.  Computer models can help.  It is cruel and inhumane to kill animals for our own benefits.

In addition, only animals that are going to be killed for other reasons (e.g. because they are sick or injured) should be used in scientific research.
