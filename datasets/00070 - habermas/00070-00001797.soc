# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government needs to do more to help young people who are struggling to buy a house. It is very difficult for young people to save enough money for the hefty deposit on a house, let alone be able to afford a mortgage. The government could help young people by building more houses and making it easier to get a mortgage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Government should do more to help young people get on the housing ladder, such as providing more homes, and more help to save for a deposit and access a mortgage. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government needs to do more to help young people who are struggling to buy a house. Young people are being priced out of the housing market and house prices are rising far higher than salaries. Therefore, young people will never be able to afford a house unless they have help from their parents or are very lucky. The government needs to build more affordable housing and implement schemes to help people get onto the property ladder. This could include the government gifting money towards the deposit of first time buyers and even paying the interest on their mortgages for a few years, allowing them to build up enough equity in the property to get their own mortgage or loan. The government could also make some changes to stamp duty, such as having a higher threshold and a lower tax rate to save people money. However, a house building scheme would be much more effective and help a lot more people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “The government needs to be doing more to help young people who are struggling to buy a house. House prices have gone through the roof whilst wages have gone stagnant. It takes years and years for young people to save enough for a deposit, and even then we often don't have a large enough salary to get a mortgage for the rest of the house. We end up being stuck paying astronomical prices for rent and not being able to even begin saving for a home of our own. The government needs to be building more houses, and fast. They also need to be doing more to help young people get onto the property ladder. This could be done through schemes such as help to buy ISAs and lifetime ISAs, which are available to young people to help them save for a deposit on a house. It could also be done through lowering stamp duty for young people, or by helping young people to get onto the property ladder through schemes such as shared ownership.”
