# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We as a society are not doing enough to fight climate change. Individuals need to take greater responsibility for their own environmental impact. Governments need to put environmental sustainability ahead of short-term economic gains. Industry needs to innovate and develop genuinely sustainable business models that do not impact the environment in a negative way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - As a society we are not doing enough to fight climate change. If we are to live in a world where the environment can support all species and human life in the future we need to address climate change and change the way we live our lives. This requires changes in policy and regulation and new methods of production. As consumers, we can also do our bit by making more sustainable choices in terms of what we buy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, our society is not doing enough to fight climate change. However, it is important to recognise that society is a very broad term and many different people are fighting climate change in different ways. Some individuals are working towards becoming carbon neutral and implementing sustainable practices in their everyday lives, while others are taking to the streets to protest in support of change. In a broader sense, many organisations such as charities are fighting climate change by advocating for change. For example, the WWF and 350.org. Despite this, however, not enough is being done to fight climate change. If we are to slow the effects of climate change, we need more people to become aware of the issue and support a move towards sustainable practices, including the government and industries, as they have a major role to play in fighting climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we as a society are not doing enough to fight climate change. There is too much vested interest and inertia from governments and large corporations. This has led to a collective inaction to properly address the problem, as well as underinvestment in renewables. While there are many things that individuals can do to help combat climate change, the problem needs a large collective effort from governments and corporations to truly have an impact. Governments need to support companies in investing in clean technologies and subsidies for renewable energy, to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and develop clean energy alternatives.
