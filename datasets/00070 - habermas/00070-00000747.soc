# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should ban the use of plastic in disposable containers. The group of participants felt that the environmental cost of using plastic was too great and that the cost of alternative materials would be offset by the reduction in environmental damage caused by plastic. The group of participants felt that there were enough viable alternatives to plastic that the cost to consumers would be minimal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a ban on the use of plastic in disposable containers. This is good for the environment as plastic takes a very long time to degrade and has limited recyclability. However the difficulty arises in that plastic containers are cheap to manufacture and deliver. If they are to be banned then companies will need to use more expensive environmentally friendly options such as foil or paper. This cost ultimately is likely to be passed onto the end user/consumer and this may therefore disproportionately impact the poorest in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a ban on the use of plastic in disposable containers. This is due to the damage that plastic causes to the environment. However, alternatives to plastic need to be carefully considered to make sure they are not more harmful to the environment. The cost of alternatives also needs to be carefully considered, as it may be passed onto the consumer and this may impact the poorest in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should ban the use of plastic in disposable containers. However, it is important to note that there is a cost implication of using alternative materials and this will impact on the poorest in society. The government should subsidise the use of alternative materials to make them more affordable for all.
