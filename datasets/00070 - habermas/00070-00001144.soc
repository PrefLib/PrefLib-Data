# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should introduce a wealth tax. A wealth tax is necessary to ensure a more equal society can flourish. As the richest continue to increase their wealth passively, the poorest can continue to be trapped in a poverty cycle that isn't of their own making; a wealth tax would be a way to redistribute wealth from the very rich to the poorest and most vulnerable. The money from a wealth tax in the UK could be used to assist underfunded public sectors such as the NHS. It is abysmal that the UK is one of the highest places in the world in terms of wealth inequality. A wealth tax set at a sensible rate would barely make a difference to the lives of the incredibly rich people that would be effected by it, but make a huge difference to the rest of society as it could fund programs to benefit the poorest and most vulnerable. There are no real downsides.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should introduce a wealth tax. A wealth tax is necessary to ensure a more equal society can flourish. As the richest continue to increase their wealth passively, the poorest can continue to be trapped in a poverty cycle that isn't of their own making; A wealth tax set at a sensible rate would barely make a difference to the lives of the incredibly rich people that would be effected by it, but make a huge difference to the rest of society as it could fund programs to benefit the poorest and most vulnerable. There are no real downsides.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final consensus statement: The UK should introduce a wealth tax. As the richest continue to increase their wealth passively, the poorest can continue to be trapped in a poverty cycle that isn't of their own making. A wealth tax could be used to institute a universal basic income, likely to be needed in future as employment changes through new technologies such as AI. However, a wealth tax set at a sensible rate would barely make a difference to the lives of the incredibly rich people that would be effected by it, but make a huge difference to the rest of society as it could fund programs to benefit the poorest and most vulnerable. There are no real downsides. The decision to introduce wealth tax involves careful consideration of its potential impact on the economy, social equity, and administrative feasibility. Policy makers must engage in thorough analysis consult experts and consider various perspectives before implementing such measures.
