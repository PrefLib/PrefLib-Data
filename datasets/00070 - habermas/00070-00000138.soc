# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, gambling on sporting events should not be banned, since this violates the freedom of the individual to engage in non-harmful, consensual activities. It is also not in the interests of the government to do so, since this would require funding extra support services for problem gamblers. However, it is important that the government is able to monitor this and take steps to ensure that individuals are not gambling beyond their means.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Gambling should not be banned on sporting events. However, the government should monitor gambling on sporting events to ensure that people do not gamble beyond their means.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Gambling on sporting events should not be banned. However, gambling operators should have the responsibility to ensure that individuals are not gambling beyond their means.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should not ban gambling on sporting events as it is not inherently harmful, however we should encourage gambling operators to put measures in place to ensure that individuals are not gambling beyond their means.
