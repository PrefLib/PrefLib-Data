# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of imposing limits on political donations, but felt that it was a complex issue. The group felt that the best way to tackle the issue was to provide public funding for political parties and candidates, and to ban private donations. The group felt that it was important to note that there are some potential drawbacks to this approach, and that it was important to find the right balance between public and private funding.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a limit on political donations. We feel that this is an important issue because some people can use their money to influence politicians. This can cause corruption and a lack of trust in the political system. We think that some sort of limit should be set because it would help to ensure that politicians are making decisions that benefit the public rather than a small group of people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a limit on how much political donations an individual can make. This is because large donations can lead to politicians becoming beholden to certain individuals or corporations. This is bad for democracy as it can lead to decisions being made that benefit the interests of a few, rather than the many. The issue of how to set this limit is more difficult. Some countries have strict limits on donations, whereas others allow for large donations. The ideal system would be one that allows for a level playing field for all candidates, without favouring those with large amounts of money.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a limit on how much political donations an individual can make. This is because donations can be used in both negative and positive ways so it can be hard to say one way or the other as taking away such donations could remove funding from something that is desperately needed. On the other hand, these donations influence political decisions that lean towards the best interest of the donator, which may have negative consequences for the citizens.
