# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of a ban on smoking in public places. This is because smoking is a personal choice which affects the health and comfort of others. Being smoked on in a public place is like being vomited on by a stranger, if that vomit was carcinogenic. The group did, however, recognise that smoking is an addiction and that it is very difficult to quit. Therefore, the group was in favour of designated smoking areas in public places, so that smokers can still enjoy a cigarette without negatively impacting on the health of others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Consensus View: We agree that smoking in public places should be banned. Smoking is a personal choice but when you are smoking in a public place you are inflicting this on others. Smoking in public places is the passive equivalent of being shot at with bullets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “Yes, smoking in public places should be banned. Smoking is a personal choice, but as such can affect others. Some are allergic to smoke or have breathing problems and should not be forced to endure it because of the actions of another. It is also shown that the effects of second hand smoke can be harmful, and therefore it should not be allowed to happen in public places where people do not have the ability to get away from the smoke. We believe that banning smoking in public places would also lead to a decrease in the amount of people who smoke, which would then in turn have a positive impact on the general health of the population.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People have the right to smoke and vape, however not in public places where it can affect others. This is an example of how a group of people with different views can come to a consensus opinion on a question. The question was not whether smoking was a good or bad thing, but whether it should be allowed in public places.
