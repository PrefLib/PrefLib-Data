# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The world will never reach a point of zero inequality. As a result of capitalism, some people will always have more money than others. The gap between the rich and poor will never be closed. In addition, some people will always be more privileged than others, as a result of things such as the family they were born into, their gender, their race and their body size. Some people will always be more privileged than others and some people will always be more selfish than others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We don't believe the world will ever reach a point of zero inequality. We believe this because there are too many differing views and lifestyles to be able to reach a consensus. Also, people in different countries have different religions and beliefs, therefore, they will not want to change the inequality. There are also different languages and cultures around the world, so people will not understand each other's views. People are also born into different situations and have different opportunities. Some people are born into money, so will always have a better chance in life than those who are born into poverty. Some people are born into the royal family and will always have a better chance in life than those who are born into poverty. I have attached the Google Doc with the individual participant's opinions and the consensus statement for your reference.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is unlikely that the world will ever reach a point of zero inequality, in all regards of the world. While it may be possible to reduce gender and racial inequality through cultural shifts, financial inequality is highly likely to remain. Some would argue that it is a by-product of capitalism, but, as a more general view, financial inequality is required in a healthy economic system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Inequality is a very complex subject and we don't believe that it will ever reach a point of zero inequality. The varying factors of religion, race, gender and sexuality will always be a factor. We think that some inequality is needed to create a healthy economy and to create an environment of healthy competition. However, the world should strive to create a more equal world where all people are treated equally and have equal opportunities.
