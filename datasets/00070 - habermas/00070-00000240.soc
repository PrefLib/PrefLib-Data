# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although the group had mixed opinions, we decided that it was not the government's place to restrict the amount of calories in sugary drinks. Education about the harms of sugar, and taxing sugary drinks to increase their price would be more effective. The group also agreed that the government has bigger issues to tackle, such as climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to government intervention in this area. However, if people in the UK continue to drink large amounts of sugary drinks, then the government should use tax to encourage people to reduce the amount they drink. Tax is better than banning sugary drinks because it gives people a choice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should not limit the number of calories in a sugary drink. We need to take a more holistic approach to the obesity epidemic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, the government should not restrict the number of calories in sugary drinks. The issue of calories in sugary drinks is one that is easily avoided with a small amount of education. The government should focus more on things like increasing the price of sugary drinks to promote a move to healthier alternatives.
