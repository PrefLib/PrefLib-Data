# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the BBC should not be funded by the tax-payer.  The BBC is a very large organisation, and has many different functions.  Some of these functions, such as providing a news service, should be funded by the tax-payer, as it is important for democracy that there is a neutral news service that can report on political issues.

However, this does not mean that the BBC should be funded by the tax-payer for all of its services.  The BBC provides a wide range of services, including news, entertainment, and educational programmes.  We think that the BBC should be funded by the tax-payer for its news service, but not for its entertainment or educational programmes.
