# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool that has the potential to be extremely beneficial to humanity. It can help us in a vast range of areas such as health, economics, space science and so on. But it can also be a dangerous tool if used without regulation and care. It is still in relative infancy so as a society do we yet know all the permutations and consequences of AI?  How will it be managed and by whom?  I have to say I feel uneasy about it and I don't think it should be used to make important decisions.  That should be left to humans debating and considering all the consequences of their actions and decisions. The same group of participants was also asked to address the following question: Is it okay to use artificial intelligence to make important decisions?

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Final consensus statement: Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool that has the potential to be extremely beneficial to humanity. It can help us in a vast range of areas such as health, economics, space science and so on. However, it is still in relative infancy. Therefore, as a society, we do not yet know all the permutations and consequences of AI.  This puts us in a position where we must move with caution, considering the ethical, moral, sociological and legal implications of AI. Ultimately, we need to be considerate of the positive ways in which AI can benefit humans, whilst also ensuring we do not put humanity in a potentially dangerous position.  This means that although important decisions should always be made by humans debating and considering the consequences of their actions and decisions, we need to use AI to assist in the way humans make these decisions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have seen that there is much potential for artificial intelligence to become an important part of our everyday lives. But this should only take place if the public, policymakers and all the key players are involved with the design. Here are some key points we have come up with:
