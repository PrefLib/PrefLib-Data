# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the UK's departure from the EU is not a good thing for the country. The UK has put itself in a worse off position than what it was before in all ways, it's essentially going back in time. We have restricted free movement for ourselves as well as those in the remainder of Europe, we have made travel more difficult, made importing/exporting riskier and more expensive. Overall is has started a downfall to the UK's economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, the UK's departure from the EU is not a good thing for the country. The UK has put itself in a worse off position than what it was before in all ways, it's essentially going back in time. We have restricted free movement for ourselves as well as those in the remainder of Europe, we have made travel more difficult, made importing/exporting riskier and more expensive. Overall is has started a downfall to the UK's economy. This has led to a loss of jobs and industry moving elsewhere in order to avoid tax rates importing into Europe and other issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, the UK's departure from the EU is not a good thing for the country. The UK has put itself in a worse off position than what it was before in all ways, it's essentially going back in time. We have restricted free movement for ourselves as well as those in the remainder of Europe, we have made travel more difficult, made importing/exporting riskier and more expensive. Overall is has started a downfall to the UK's economy. The UK's economy has been in a worse state since leaving the EU, the inflation has risen and the unemployment has risen. The travel industry has suffered, the transport industry has suffered and the importing/exporting industry has suffered. The UK is going back in time, it is not moving forward and it is not a good thing for the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, the UK's departure from the EU is not a good thing for the country. The UK has put itself in a worse off position than what it was before in all ways, it's essentially going back in time. We have restricted free movement for ourselves as well as those in the remainder of Europe, we have made travel more difficult, made importing/exporting riskier and more expensive. Overall is has started a downfall to the UK's economy. The inflation is getting out of hands currently and it doesn't seem like there will be and end to it any time soon in fact it seems that it will just worsen year by year. I think the UK thought they can be much more independent then what they're actually capable of.
