# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the government should support cultural organisations as they are important for society and for people to explore the arts. They allow visitors to regions to see local arts which in turn will bring money into the economy, therefore the government should support this. However, this needs to be balanced with the current economic climate of the country and money used to support cultural organisations should not be prioritised over more pressing concerns such as cost of living and rising fuel costs. This opinion is supported by all of the participants.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final consensus statement: In general, the government should support cultural organisations. The government should support them for three reasons. First, they are important for society and for people to explore the arts. Second, they allow visitors to regions to see local arts which in turn will bring money into the economy. Finally, they provide opportunities for people to come together in groups which is important in order to strengthen communities. This needs to be balanced with the current economic climate of the country and money used to support cultural organisations should not be prioritised over more pressing concerns such as cost of living and rising fuel costs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Cultural organisations are important for society and for people to explore the arts. They allow visitors to regions to see local arts which in turn will bring money into the economy, therefore the government should support this. However, this needs to be balanced with the current economic climate of the country and money used to support cultural organisations should not be prioritised over more pressing concerns such as cost of living and rising fuel costs. The benefits to local people and education were also emphasised as part of the consensus.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Cultural organisations are important for society and for people to explore the arts. They allow visitors to regions to see local arts which in turn will bring money into the economy, therefore the government should support this. However, this needs to be balanced with the current economic climate of the country and money used to support cultural organisations should not be prioritised over more pressing concerns such as cost of living and rising fuel costs. The intangible benefits that cultural organisations can bring to a community should also not be forgotten.
