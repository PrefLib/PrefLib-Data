# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - A carbon tax would help to reduce pollution, but the question is, what would be taxed, who would be taxed and how would this be determined. If a tax is to be imposed, it would need to be on individuals as well as businesses. However, it would need to be implemented in a carefully managed way. Whilst individuals and businesses could be taxed for actions which have an effect on the level of carbon in the atmosphere, there is also a need to ensure that the tax does not result in an undue financial burden on low income earners and the middle class, who need the most support at the moment, or on small businesses whose viability depends on profit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A carbon tax would help to reduce pollution but the question is, what would be taxed, who would be taxed and how would this be determined? If a tax is to be imposed, it would need to be on individuals as well as businesses but this would need to be done in a way that does not adversely affect the pockets of hard working people, as they would be the ones to really end up paying for it. If the burden of a tax is put on individuals, it could be detrimental to low income earners and even the middle classes, who will find it hard to absorb an extra tax. If the tax is imposed on businesses, it will be the end user who is going to feel the pinch, as they will have to pay higher prices for products.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - A carbon tax would help to reduce pollution, but the question is, what would be taxed, who would be taxed and how would this be determined. If a tax is to be imposed, it would need to be on individuals as well as businesses. If the burden of a tax is put on individuals, it could be detrimental to low income earners and even the middle classes, who will find it hard to absorb an extra tax. If the tax is imposed on businesses, it will be the end user who is going to feel the pinch, as they will have to pay higher prices for products. We do not feel that a carbon tax would be a popular move. A carbon tax should not be viewed as the sole answer to pollution. We feel that the government should impose a carbon tax on businesses who produce the most carbon emissions, but that they should also offer tax relief and other incentives to those businesses that are taking steps to cut their carbon emissions. In addition, the government should also educate and encourage individuals to use public transport and to consider other ways of reducing their carbon emissions, such as home insulation and using energy efficient light bulbs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - A carbon tax would help to reduce pollution, but the question is, what would be taxed, who would be taxed and how would this be determined. If a tax is to be imposed, it would need to be on individuals as well as businesses. If the burden of a tax is put on individuals, it could be detrimental to low income earners and even the middle classes, who will find it hard to absorb an extra tax. If the tax is imposed on businesses, it will be the end user who is going to feel the pinch, as they will have to pay higher prices for products. However, if the tax is imposed on industries, it should be targeted at the ones that produce the most carbon, such as motor racing and flying, as these are the highest carbon producers.
