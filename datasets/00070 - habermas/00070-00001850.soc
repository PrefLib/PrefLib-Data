# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We should use public funds to develop artificial intelligence (AI). However, this should be done with care. There needs to be a limit to how much money the government puts into AI, as otherwise it may end up a waste of resources. The government should have some control over where the money for AI goes, so that AI isn’t just used for the private sector. We cannot have AI just being in the hands of private companies. The UK needs to make sure it is not left behind other countries in the AI field, as otherwise we will struggle to develop. The government also needs to ensure that the public sector, as well as the private sector, benefits from AI, so that everyone benefits from its use.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “Yes, we should use public funds to develop artificial intelligence. However, this should be done with care. The government should have a tight control over the direction AI takes, and should not allow it to be purely in private hands. The government should also be cautious and not spend too much money on AI, as it may be a waste of resources. The government should also not spend too little money on AI, as it may leave the UK behind other countries. The government should also ensure that AI is used to help the public sector, and not just the private sector. This will ensure that the public benefits from AI, and not just the private sector. Additionally, it will increase quality of life for people in the UK. This will also allow us to compete with other countries, and ensure that we do not lag behind.” Participants were then asked to reflect on the process of how the final consensus statement was reached. Some of the reflections were: “It was difficult to reach a final consensus view, as people have very different opinions. However, in the end we were able to reach a final consensus, as we all listened to each other and were willing to compromise. This shows that in the end everyone can agree on something.” “

Others may reach a different consensus. We welcome all viewpoints and value people who disagree with us, as this will help us to improve our position on this question, and give us ideas for new questions to debate. What Are Our Policies? Currently the questions we have debated on are: “Should we use public funds to develop artificial intelligence?”: Yes. “Do we believe that any domestic taxes should be devolved?”: Yes. “Do we feel any gender imbal

However, the government should not restrict private companies too much, as they will be able to use AI to make money and may use that to invest in research that will benefit the public sector as well.”
