# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the idea that the government should provide free life-saving treatment to any child who needs it. The group felt that this is an important issue and that it is the government’s duty to provide this treatment. The group felt that the government should provide this treatment as it is a basic human right. The group also felt that the government should provide this treatment as it would be beneficial for the economy in the long run. The group felt that the government should provide this treatment as it would be the morally right thing to do.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should provide free life-saving treatment to any child who needs it. We believe that every child has the right to life and that this should be upheld regardless of their nationality or financial situation. This is a universal right that is applicable to all human beings. The NHS is a fantastic institution that has been at the core of this country for many years. It would be a shame to see it fail due to lack of funding. The NHS is a fantastic example of a universal healthcare system that should be used as an example to other countries. We believe that providing life-saving treatment to children will help to create a fairer society that will benefit from a societal and economic perspective.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of the government providing free life-saving treatment to any child who needs it. The group was in favour of this for a number of reasons. Firstly, they felt that children are the future of the country and that the government has a duty to ensure that they are kept alive and healthy. Secondly, they felt that children are unable to make the decision for themselves and therefore the government should be responsible for ensuring that they receive the treatment that they need. Thirdly, they felt that the government should be responsible for ensuring that children have the best start in life possible and that this can be achieved by ensuring that they receive the treatment that they need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should provide free life-saving treatment to any child who needs it. The government has a responsibility to provide healthcare to all people, regardless of their financial situation. This is because all people have the right to life, and it is the duty of the government to protect this right. In addition, the government has a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable in society, and this includes children. It is not acceptable for children to die because their parents cannot afford the treatment. It is also not acceptable for children to die because they are not citizens of the country.
