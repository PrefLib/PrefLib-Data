# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The state has a responsibility to monitor the food that is produced and sold within its jurisdiction.  Food suppliers shouldn't be allowed free reign to sell anything they like without any form of regulation.   It is important to acknowledge that there are arguments for and against the state being allowed to make laws banning the sale of products based on their nutritional content. On the one hand, the state is responsible for the health and wellbeing of its citizens. If a product is seen as being so harmful to the general health of the population, then surely the state has a responsibility to protect its citizens and, if necessary, enact legislation to ban it. On the other hand, the state should be encouraging people to make their own choices, educating the population on the dangers of certain products. If the state makes a law banning a product, then surely it is depriving people of the choice to make their own decision. It is also important to note that what is healthy for one person is not necessarily healthy for another. For example, diabetics are encouraged to eat low carb high fat diets, yet these diets are generally seen as unhealthy for most people.

Although there were differing opinions within the group, through careful discussion and deliberation, participants were able to come to a consensus opinion and explain their view.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The state has a responsibility to monitor the food that is produced and sold within its jurisdiction.  Food suppliers shouldn't be allowed free reign to sell anything they like without any form of regulation.  Nutritional content is a tricky subject and whilst the population should be able to decide for themselves what they eat, some products could be viewed as being nothing but harmful to consumers and can't be viewed as even part of a balanced diet.  The state has a responsibility to provide healthcare for its citizens and part of that should incorporate a strategy to promote and encourage healthy eating and therefore this strategy may include a small level of restricting sale of a limited number of products which can only be seen as harmful to health.  This is something that should be done very carefully and only in extreme circumstances when the products in question are truly harmful to the health of the citizens.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There are pros and cons for allowing the state to make laws banning the sale of products based on their nutritional content. In the face of extreme health problems due to products, the state may have a duty to protect its citizens and should intervene. The state should also have the role of educating the population on the hazards of certain foods, leading by example with laws and providing options of healthy foods for those unable to buy it. If such legislation is passed, care should be taken to ensure that the state is not simply appeasing big businesses, rather than passing such laws based on science, which has not always been the most reliable of fields. However, we must be aware that legislation should not remove the need for good education. There is a duty to teach people to make their own good choices. While the state can intervene, this should be based on scientific reasoning and not solely based on public opinion.
