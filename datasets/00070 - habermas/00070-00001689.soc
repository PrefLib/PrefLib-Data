# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the introduction of driverless cars will result in a decrease in the number of road accidents. The reason for this is that the human factor will be removed from the equation. This is because humans are prone to making mistakes, which can result in road accidents. This is not to say that driverless cars will not make any mistakes, but the fact that they will not be subject to human error, will result in a decrease in the number of road accidents.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There is potential for driverless cars to result in more accidents, but as the technology develops it should become more reliable.  There will always be the risk of computer error, and there is no human oversight in driverless cars.  Pedestrians and other drivers may also be more at risk, due to the fact that the car is silent and does not behave like a car with a human driver.  But in time, when driverless cars are more common, it is likely that pedestrians will become more aware of them and that they will be programmed to be more obvious to pedestrians.  It is also likely that other drivers will become more accustomed to their behavior.  This may all lead to a decrease in the number of accidents.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the introduction of driverless cars will lead to an increase in the number of road accidents. This is because the technology is still in its early stages of development, and is therefore prone to failure. Also, driverless cars will not be able to react to sudden and unexpected situations, which are often the cause of many accidents. However, the introduction of driverless cars will lead to a reduction in the number of accidents caused by human error, such as falling asleep at the wheel, or driving under the influence of alcohol.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Driverless cars will cause an increase in road accidents.
