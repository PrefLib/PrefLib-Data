# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children should not be allowed to buy a bicycle because they are not old enough to ride one on the road, and their parents should be responsible for buying them a bike. This is a classic example of the majority view being right, and shows the power of group discussion to bring people round to the right view.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, there should not be a legal minimum age limit for buying a bicycle. We do not think it is an area that the government should legislate about. Children are routinely bought a bicycle by their parents and carers at the correct time. Bicycles are a fast, reliable and cheap alternative to cars or public transport and it would be a shame to deprive younger people of that benefit. Riding a bicycle is also generally good for your health and as a mode of transport will most likely become more prevalent as the world goes greener.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I think there should be a legal minimum age limit for buying a bicycle.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that there should be no legal minimum age limit for buying a bicycle.  However we would like to see local cycling clubs providing bicycle lessons for younger children to ensure that they are cycling safely. We would also like to see bicycle manufacturers working with local authorities to provide advice on how to fit bicycles and cycling accessories to cyclists to ensure maximum safety.
