# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should not rejoin the European Union. There are many reasons for this, the most important being that it would completely undermine democracy. The people have spoken and it is our duty to respect their decision. There are also other reasons, such as the fact that the UK is not known for being in conflict with any countries, and the security of the UK is not at risk. The UK is also not in a financial crisis, and the cost of living is not a major issue. The UK is also not in a multicultural crisis, and the UK has weathered much worse storms than this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the UK rejoining the EU. The reasons for this were that the UK is a sovereign nation and should be able to make its own decisions. Also, the idea of a superstate was seen as a threat to the UK's national identity. However, there was some recognition that the EU does have some benefits, such as the free movement of people, goods, services and capital, but that these could be achieved through other means, such as bilateral agreements.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the UK rejoining the EU. The reasons for this included the fact that the UK has already left the EU, and the fact that it would be undemocratic to go against the decision of the people in the referendum. However, there was some debate about whether the referendum was a fair process, and whether the people were informed enough to make a decision. The group felt that it was important to have a diverse and multicultural society, and that the UK would benefit from staying in the EU for this reason. The group also felt that it would be beneficial to have a bigger union in order to resolve matters, and that the UK would be stronger as part of a bigger unit. However, the group felt that it would be difficult to rejoin the EU, and that it would be better to focus on making the most of the current situation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should not rejoin the EU. The people have spoken and it is the democratic right of the people to have their say. The referendum was the biggest democratic exercise the UK has ever seen and the result must be respected. There are many reasons to stay out of the EU, not least the cost to the UK economy. The EU has been a disaster for many countries, Greece being a prime example. It is not in the interests of the UK to rejoin the EU.
