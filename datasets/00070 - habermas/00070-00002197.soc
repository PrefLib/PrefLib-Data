# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, people should not be allowed to own and keep guns in their homes. We live in a society where we have laws and rules and if we break them there are consequences. If people are allowed to own guns in their homes, this will lead to more deaths, more school shootings and more terrorist attacks. The only people that should be allowed to own guns are the police and the army. If people are living in dangerous situations a gun might offer them protection and make them feel safer. There should be other ways for protection though, not guns.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, people should not be allowed to own and keep guns in their homes. We live in a society where we have laws and rules which have consequences if broken and keep us safe. If people are allowed to own guns within the home this will lead to more deaths and an increase in incidents like school shootings/mass attacks. Police are even limited to who carry a fire weapon and have to undergo extensive training to do so, general on beat officers carry other weapons instead of guns to minimise the fatality guns can bring. There are plenty of other ways to protect your home and person other than guns. Teenagers taking their parents guns to uphold social status, jealous ex partners, mentally unstable individuals and so on will always be there but a gun is a quick fire way to kill someone and the consequences often fatal. There should be other ways for protection though, not guns.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, people should not be allowed to own and keep guns in their homes. We live in a society where we have laws and rules which have consequences if broken and keep us safe. If people are allowed to own guns within the home this will lead to more deaths and an increase in incidents like school shootings/mass attacks. Police are even limited to who carry a fire weapon and have to undergo extensive training to do so, general on beat officers carry other weapons instead of guns to minimise the fatality guns can bring. There are plenty of other ways to protect your home and person other than guns. The risk of teenagers getting hands on them from the home is scarily high, and revenge shootings also. The only people that should be allowed to own guns are the police and the army. If people are living in dangerous situations a gun might offer them protection and make them feel safer. There should be other ways for protection though, not guns.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, people should not be allowed to own and keep guns in their homes. In America, this has led to innocent people being shot if the home owner thought they were entering their home illegally or posed a threat when they didn't. The guns can also be taken from their homes and used in school shootings ect. However, we understand that if people are living in dangerous situations a gun might offer them protection and make them feel safer. There should be other ways for protection though, not guns.
