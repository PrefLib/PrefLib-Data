# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Nuclear energy is clean and green when compared to energy sources such as fossil fuels. A nuclear power station needs less land and resource than many green equivalents. Although not a perfect answer, nuclear energy is a good interim solution until we have a sufficient green energy strategy. This will prevent us from being dependent on foreign energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Nuclear power is by far the cleanest of all the current non-renewable energy sources. It emits less than half the amount of carbon dioxide as coal, the most polluting energy source. We also have the opportunity to harness a huge amount of energy. With the vast amount of nuclear power stations that we have, we could supply the entire nation for 300 years. There is, however, a downfall to nuclear energy and that is the radiation that comes from the waste and potential leakages in the power stations. These can be hazardous to both human health and the environment. We must use the advantages of nuclear power, however. We must also look into alternatives to power stations. Renewable energy is good, but cannot match the huge output of energy that is required to power our country. For now, we must use nuclear power to our advantage.

We must also be vigilant in monitoring the safety of the power stations and finding alternatives to them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Nuclear energy remains one of our best options for generating electricity. With the vast amount of nuclear power stations, we can supply the nation for 300 years. Other sources of energy are being explored but we are not as close to achieving these alternatives as we are with nuclear power. Unfortunately there are potential risks of radiation from waste and leakages of the power stations. However, technology is developing rapidly and power stations will continue to increase safety. The UK should look to develop research to ensure we are at the forefront of these technological developments. We cannot ignore the drawbacks of nuclear energy, however for now it is the best option. Task 5: Self-Reflection of NSSD Process First, each person was asked to make a pledge of how the NSSD process had affected their decision making process and their understanding of energy issues. Pledge from Participant 1: By using this process I have been able to examine the opinions of others on this issue, something I often do not do in making a decision. It has therefore expanded my world view and made me appreciate that there are often many ways of looking at an issue. I have also enjoyed being part of a group and making a decision together. Pledge from Participant 2:
2: 3,2,4,1
2: 3,2,1,4
1: 2,3,1,4
