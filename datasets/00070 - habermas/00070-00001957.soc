# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the possession of guns should be heavily regulated and not permitted for personal protection. In some countries where it is legal to do so, there should be strict protocols in place to ensure that guns are only in the possession of responsible and mentally competent individuals. There should be strict procedures an individual has to go through to be able to qualify for a firearm purchase, to make it as safe and responsible as possible. Guns are incredibly dangerous and therefore should only be in the possession of those who have had gun safety training, are responsible gun licence holders and are mentally competent. It is a large responsibility to own a gun and should be treated with a great deal of respect and dignity. In certain countries where it is easy to obtain a gun, there are hundreds of shootings every year, many of which constitute as mass shootings or end in mortalities. You have a right to protect yourself, which may include use of a gun, but it should not be easy to obtain a gun if you are not qualified or responsible enough to have one.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of people being able to keep their own guns for their own protection. The risk of guns in the home is too high and we need to reduce the number of guns in circulation. We were in favour of the idea of guns being kept at secure locations, such as sports clubs, for use in the appropriate sporting context. We felt that in some countries where guns are legal, such as the USA, the level of gun ownership is too high and this is an issue that needs to be addressed. The group also felt that the ease of gun access is an issue that needs to be addressed, with the introduction of tougher regulations and more thorough vetting of individuals. The group felt that it was important to reduce the number of guns in circulation and that the use of guns should be limited to the appropriate sporting context.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People should not be able to keep guns for their own protection. If they feel they are in danger, they can report to the police who will deal with the situation. Keeping a gun in your house is likely to increase the chance of an accident. In countries where guns are easily accessible there are hundreds of shootings every year, many of which constitute as mass shootings or end in mortalities. Gun violence is a real issue, and people should not be allowed to keep guns in their houses as this is likely to increase the number of shootings. There is also little justification for the need to keep guns in houses. People should not be allowed to keep guns in their houses because it increases the risk of accidents.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People should not be able to keep guns for their own protection. If they feel unsafe in their own homes, then they can report this to the police and request police assistance in making their home more secure. It is dangerous to allow people to keep guns for their own protection, especially if these people are not trained in the use of firearms. Guns are a lethal weapon and it is irresponsible to give them to people who do not have training in their use and their safe storage. In many countries where guns are widely available, there are mass shootings, with untrained gun owners using their weapons to harm others. People should not be allowed to keep guns in their homes, as there is a risk of gun related accidents or incidents. Guns are a dangerous weapon and should only be in the hands of trained professionals.
