# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Horse meat is not a sustainable option in the UK. The health benefits of horse meat are not enough to justify eating it, and there are many other meats that are readily available and can be eaten without the need for slaughtering horses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Horse meat is a sustainable and healthy source of protein, and horses have been eaten in other countries for many years, so there is no reason why we shouldn't allow it to be eaten here. It would also increase horse welfare as many horses are currently malnourished and in a poor state.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Horse meat is a very good source of protein and can be a sustainable source of food.  However, we do not believe that it should be legalised in the UK as the majority of people do not eat horse meat and would not be happy with it being legalised.  This would cause unnecessary upset and distress.  We also feel that there is enough suffering in the UK meat industry and we do not need to add another animal to the mix.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that eating horse meat should not be legal in the UK. Although it has a higher nutritional value than beef and is a great source of protein, there are already plenty of other great sources of protein in the UK. Eating horse meat will only increase the pollution of the environment. It is currently legal in many other countries, however we believe that there are plenty of other animals to be eaten. In the current climate of eating meat, there are more than enough animals to be eaten already and horse meat would only be a further burden on the environment.
