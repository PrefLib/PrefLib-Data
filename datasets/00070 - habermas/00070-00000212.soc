# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, gender-based words should not be removed from our language
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, they should not be removed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although history has often oppressed females, gender-based language remains a part of our history, culture and language. Language shifts are made organically and subtly, and this may be the case in the future that we don't have gender-based words, but a sudden change is not necessary and will help nobody.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is no need to change our language as it has been in place for so long and has not really caused any issues in the past.
