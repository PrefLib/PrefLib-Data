# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the protection of privacy.  It was felt that there are sufficient measures in place to protect the privacy of citizens in most areas.  However, it was felt that there is a need for more education for citizens on the use of the internet and the dangers of leaving a digital footprint.  The group felt that the government needs to take a more active role in this and to ensure that the legislation is updated to reflect the changes in technology.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There are enough measures in place to protect the privacy of citizens. We have the Data Protection Act and the right to privacy under the Human Rights Act 1998. However, the Data Protection Act is sometimes ignored by companies, who often take advantage of people’s ignorance of the law and how to protect themselves. Also, the laws themselves do not keep up with technological advances. As technology advances, new threats to privacy emerge. Social media is a good example of this. The internet allows us to easily connect with people across the world. But this same technology allows people to access and share our personal data with those across the world. It also allows people to invade our privacy and find out information about us that they may not otherwise have been able to access. Another good example is the recent news that the FBI can spy on people using the cameras on their laptops, tablets and phones. This is a new technology that has caused concern among privacy advocates. Although there are many laws that protect citizens, people need to be educated about these laws and how to keep themselves safe. More needs to be done to teach people about their rights to privacy and how they can protect themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There are enough measures in place to protect the privacy of citizens, however, there is room for improvement. The government needs to find a way to protect and take part in the prevention so that everyone could be safe and feel protected all the time.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There are not enough measures in place to protect the privacy of citizens. This is due to the rate of technological advances, which makes privacy in this area difficult to keep up with.
