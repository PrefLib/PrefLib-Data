# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Voting should not be compulsory. Everybody has the right to abstain from voting and do not need to provide a reason.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to compulsory voting.  Some of the arguments included the view that if a society is democratic then voting should be voluntary.  In addition, some felt that some people abstain because they do not feel that their vote matters or they are apathetic.  Others felt that it should be a free choice.  Some felt that a democracy should include the choice of not voting. One participant felt that it would make the election process more representative and that people would be more likely to engage in politics.  This might also mean that people are more likely to make their voice heard through the proper channels, such as political parties, instead of other means such as protest. However, the majority of participants did not feel that compulsory voting was the way forward and that a free choice was important in a democracy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although voting should be a democratic right and choice, it should be compulsory to vote to allow for more people to voice their opinion. This was a difficult topic for me to answer, so I was quite relieved when the group decided on a consensus view.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Voting should not be compulsory. Although it is true that many people do not vote, it should be their democratic right to choose not to. There should be no punishment for not voting. Therefore, voting should not be compulsory.
