# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, the group have decided that we should not ban the sale of alcohol and cigarettes in public places. We believe that it is an individual's choice to engage in these activities and that if they are of legal age then it is their right to do so. We also believe that if the sale of alcohol and cigarettes is banned in public places then this will lead to an increase in criminal activity as it will drive the sale of these products underground. We believe that the sale of alcohol and cigarettes should be more tightly controlled, with the sale of alcohol only being sold in licensed premises and cigarettes only being sold in licensed premises or newsagents. This will also help to reduce the number of people who are able to purchase alcohol and cigarettes who are underage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group of participants in this discussion have come to the consensus opinion that we should not ban the sale of alcohol and cigarettes in public places. We believe that it is an individual's choice to engage in these activities and that if they are of legal age then it is their right to do so. We also believe that if the sale of alcohol and cigarettes is banned in public places then this will lead to an increase in criminal activity as it will drive the sale of these products underground.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Final consensus statement: In conclusion, the group have decided that we should not ban the sale of alcohol and cigarettes in public places.

We also believe that if the sale of alcohol and cigarettes is banned in public places then this will lead to an increase in criminal activity as it will drive the sale of these products underground.

We believe that this will help to prevent underage drinking and smoking, as those operating a licensed premises will ensure that ID is retrieved before any alcohol or cigarettes are sold.
