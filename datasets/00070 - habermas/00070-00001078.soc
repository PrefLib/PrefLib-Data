# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of giving children computers at the age of 6.  The general feeling was that it would be a waste of money, and that children should be outside playing and being active.  However, the group did concede that there are some families that cannot afford a computer, and that this is something that needs to be addressed.  The group felt that there are more important things that the government needs to address before handing out free computers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children should be taught how to use computers from the age of 6, but they should not be given one for free. The reason for this is that it will probably be government funded, and there are much more important things to address before handing out free computers to everybody.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should be taught how to use computers from the age of 6, but they should not be given one for free.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While the proposition of giving free computers to all children seems like a great idea, there are some factors that may affect its success. One of the major factors is that if a computer is provided, children may be more likely to use it for recreational use rather than for educational use, since computers are very versatile and have a wide variety of uses. It is also important to remember that some children will not have a computer or a computer of their own, and will be provided with one by the government. It is possible that these children will grow up to sell their computers or let them fall into disrepair. The money to purchase the computers may also be put to better use in other areas such as the NHS.
