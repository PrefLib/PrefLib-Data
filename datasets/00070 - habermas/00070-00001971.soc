# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of people being able to keep their own guns for their own protection. The risk of guns in the home is too high and we need to reduce the number of guns in circulation. In particular, the use of guns in a domestic context has the risk of children having access to guns as well as the risk of a shooting during a domestic dispute that escalates. We were in favour of the idea of guns being kept at secure locations, such as sports clubs, for use in the appropriate sporting context. We felt that in some countries where guns are legal, such as the USA, the level of gun ownership is too high and this is an issue that needs to be addressed. The group also felt that the ease of gun access is an issue that needs to be addressed, with the introduction of tougher regulations and more thorough vetting of individuals, especially in the USA. The group felt that it was important to reduce the number of guns in circulation and that the use of guns should be limited to the appropriate sporting context.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be strict controls on gun ownership and gun licensing. We feel that there is a need for more robust and thorough vetting of individuals who wish to own guns. There should be strict regulations on gun storage to ensure that guns are kept away from children and others who may not have had gun safety training. There is a need to reduce the number of guns in circulation and to limit gun ownership to only those who are qualified to do so.
