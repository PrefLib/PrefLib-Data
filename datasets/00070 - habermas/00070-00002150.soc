# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In the current climate, it is not possible for the UK to avoid an increase in its national debt. The government is spending money in all the wrong places and needs to be smarter with its finances. The government is also spending money on things that are not a priority and could be better spent on things that are more important. The UK needs to fix its own problems first before spending money on things that do not matter. The UK is in the midst of a cost of living crisis and money needs to be spent to help the most vulnerable people in the UK. The UK needs to prioritise where its finances go. For example, spending millions on a Covid app was such a waste of money which definitely shouldn't have costed that much.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: In the current climate, it is not possible for the UK to avoid an increase in its national debt. The government is spending money in all the wrong places and needs to be smarter with its finances. The government is also spending money on things that are not a priority. This would have less of an impact on the national debt, while putting the money into more important and more deserving places. It is proven to help the UK and more importantly the working-class families in need.
