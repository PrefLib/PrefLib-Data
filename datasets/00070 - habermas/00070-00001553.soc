# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, private companies should not be allowed to install CCTV in public places. This is because the public have a right to their own privacy and installing CCTV in public places infringes on this. However, if the private company is providing a service to the public then this is acceptable. For example, a shop installing CCTV in their shop is acceptable as they are providing a service to the public. The shop is also responsible for the safety of their customers and staff and installing CCTV is a way of protecting them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We don't think it is right for private companies to install CCTV in public places. The only exception would be if they are protecting their own property.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Private companies are not permitted to install CCTV in public places
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While the CCTV industry is an extremely important one for the protection of businesses, personal privacy should be of the upmost importance to everyone. However, we believe that if a private company can provide a valid reason for installing CCTV on a public place then it should be allowed, however it should be monitored and have restrictions to ensure it is not infringing on the privacy of the public.
