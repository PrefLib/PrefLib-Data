# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children’s views about their education are important. They should be able to express their views and opinions about what they are learning, and why they are learning it. This will help them to understand the importance of their education and to feel engaged with the process. It is also important to take into account the views of children with special educational needs, and to ensure that they are receiving the support that they need to thrive. However, children’s views should not be the only thing that is taken into account when planning their education. It is also important to consider the views of teachers, parents and other experts in the field of education, in order to ensure that children are receiving the best education possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children should have the opportunity to voice their opinions about their education, and where possible they should be allowed to shape their education, but this should not come at the cost of their long term educational success.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should have the opportunity to voice their opinions and have them taken into consideration when planning their education. The age of the child should be taken into account when considering the degree to which they should be able to influence their education. It is important to ensure every child has a well-rounded education that stands them in good stead for their future life, so they should not have the option to drop out before they have reached a level of qualification that will stand them in good stead for their future life. Young people may not have the perspective to understand the importance of this for their futures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children’s views about their education are important. Children should be able to have a say in what they learn and how they learn. However, it is also important that they are given a well-rounded education. This means they should not be able to drop out before they have reached a level of qualification that will stand them in good stead for their future life. Young people may not have the perspective to understand the importance of this for their futures.
