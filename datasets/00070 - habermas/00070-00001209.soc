# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of union representation, with one person being slightly against the idea. The general feeling was that representation was important because it allowed for the impact of any decisions made on the employees to be considered. People felt that this would prevent any industrial action that might occur if employees felt they were being unfairly treated.  The presence of a union representative also made people feel more confident to speak up, knowing that they would be heard by all.  There was a feeling that management needed to take employees' rights seriously and that the presence of a union representative would ensure this.  The group felt that union representation was important at a higher level of the organisation as well as at ground level, and the presence of a union representative would help to foster communication between the unions and companies, hopefully making unions more effective and constructive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be union representation on management and boards. The presence of a union representative will allow for more effective and efficient communication between employees and management. It also fosters collaboration and cooperation, leading to more effective problem-solving and employee satisfaction.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be representation from unions on management and boards. The presence of a union rep will make management consider employee rights more carefully than they would otherwise, as they will be cautious about not taking advantage of employees when there is a rep there. It will also foster better communication between unions and companies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Union representation is important on management boards, in both the interests of the employer and the employees. Having their representation ensure employees needs and wants are listened to at a high level. It also allows for better collaboration and communication between the business and the union, hopefully avoiding issues leading to industrial action. It is also important that the impact of any decisions made are impacted against employees.  Also union representatives can give good advice on a range of issues.   Having them present mitigates the risk of industrial action down the line.
