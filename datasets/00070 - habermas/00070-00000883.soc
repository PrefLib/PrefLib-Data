# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - A dog should have the same right to live that a human has. This is because all living things have the right to live, and a dog is a living thing. A dog can feel pain, and therefore has the right to live. A dog can feel happiness, and therefore has the right to live. A dog can feel fear, and therefore has the right to live. A dog can feel love, and therefore has the right to live. A dog is a living being, and therefore has the right to live.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A dog should have the same right to live that a human has, however it is the responsibility of the owner to ensure that their dog is kept in a safe and secure environment.  A dog should not be allowed to roam the streets as this can lead to the dog being a danger to itself and others.  A dog should not be allowed to attack other people or animals and if it does so then the owner should be responsible for the dog's actions.  The owner should ensure that their dog is properly cared for and fed.  The owner should ensure that their dog is trained properly and does not cause a nuisance to others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the statement that a dog should have the same right to live that a human has.  This is because a dog is a living creature and therefore should have the right to live.  However, the group also felt that there are some cases where a human life should be chosen over a dog's life.  For example, if a human and a dog were in a fire and there was only one way out, the human should be saved first.  This is because the human is able to make a greater contribution to society.  The group also felt that some people treat their dogs as if they are humans and this is not right.  For example, some people dress their dogs in clothes and take them everywhere with them.  This is not right as dogs are not humans and should not be treated as such.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Dogs should have the same rights as humans as they are living beings just like us. This is because dogs are animals just like humans who are classified as higher animals. Dog's possess life just like human and therefore they deserve to have the right to live. The rights of dog to live should not be based on human perception of their intelligence or worth but by the fact that they possess life and breath just like humans.
