# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is absolutely right and fair that companies that sell the software that tracks your online browsing to advertisers be required to disclose the technology they use to identify users. If we allow our online browsing to be tracked for advertisers, they should be compelled by law to provide this information to us. Anything less is simply unacceptable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Companies that sell the software that tracks your online browsing to advertisers should be required to disclose the technology they use to identify users. This is because we have a right to know how our data is being used, and to whom it is being sold.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group felt very strongly that companies should be required to disclose the technology they use to identify users, and not doing so should be heavily punished by law. The whole issue was seen as being about transparency and informed consent. By disclosing the technology they use, it allows us to make an informed choice about whether to use the software and what information to divulge to them. It also puts us in a better position to understand how we can be traced by online advertisers and what our rights are with regards to how our information is used.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Companies that sell the software that tracks your online browsing to advertisers should be required to disclose the technology they use to identify users. This is because we should be aware of what is going on with our personal data, and if we are not then we should be able to opt out of it. We also feel that it is only fair that we are made aware of the tracking software used so that we can make informed choices about what data is being tracked and sold. This will also make the advertisers more accountable for their practices and minimise the chance of them being caught up in legal or PR issues that could arise from unethical data tracking.
