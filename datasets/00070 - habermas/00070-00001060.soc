# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a tax on air fares, but it should be applied in a more targeted way. The tax should only be applied to flights that are considered to be a luxury, such as private jets. The tax should also be used to fund research into more sustainable methods of transport.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of increasing the tax on air fares. Most people in the group felt that the tax on air fares was already too high. However, it was agreed that there should be some form of tax on air fares, but that it should be applied in a more targeted way. It was suggested that the tax should only be applied to flights that are considered to be a luxury, such as private jets and sports teams flying by air to games. The group also agreed that the tax should be used to fund research into more sustainable methods of transport.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of increasing the tax on air fares. Most people in the group felt that the tax on air fares was already too high. However, it was agreed that there should be some form of tax on air fares, but that it should be applied in a more targeted way. It was suggested that the tax should only be applied to flights that are considered to be a luxury, such as private jets and sports teams flying by air to games. The group also agreed that the tax should be used to fund research into more sustainable methods of transport and that this research should be undertaken in an independent, evidence-based fashion so as not to be subject to biases.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of increasing the tax on air fares. Most people in the group felt that the tax on air fares was already too high. However, it was agreed that there should be some form of tax on air fares, but that it should be applied in a more targeted way. It was suggested that the tax should only be applied to flights that are considered to be a luxury, such as private jets. The group also agreed that the tax should be used to fund research into more sustainable methods of transport. This is important as flights are very bad for the environment, and by increasing the tax on flights, it is hoped that more people will be discouraged from taking flights. However, the money raised from this tax should be used to research more sustainable methods of transport.
