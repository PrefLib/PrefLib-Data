# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should continue to subsidise the arts. Art is a way for people to express themselves and to share their experiences with others. Art is also a way for people to connect with each other and to form communities. The UK is a very multicultural country, and art is a way for people to communicate and to share their different experiences and cultures. The UK has a very rich history and culture, and the arts are a way for this to be expressed and to be shared with others.
