# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: MPs should not be able to claim expenses for a second home. This is an unnecessary expense that the country can do without. In the current climate where there are so many people homeless or in need of housing, it is wrong to think that a second home for an MP is more important than those people. There is a big debate about MPs pay and their pay has been recently increased, therefore the expense for a second home is also not necessary. MPs are generally people who are well off and have their own money, therefore if they want a second home they should be in a position to pay for it themselves. If they can not afford a second home, then they can not afford the other luxuries that come with it and therefore are not in a position to own one. The tax payers money should not be spent on unnecessary luxuries, especially when there are so many people in need of money and resources.

The money could be better spent on helping to improve the economy and helping those in need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: MPs should not be able to claim for a second home. If they cannot afford to buy a second home, then they should not own it. MPs salaries are generally higher and with so many people on lower incomes, it is wrong to spend tax payers money on additional homes for the MPs. Also, the number of homeless people is significantly high and therefore it is wrong to use tax payers money to subsidise the lives of people who have a home and their own personal wealth. If you want a second home, you should be able to afford it yourself and we don’t want tax payers money going to subsidise that. If you can’t afford it, why should other people pay for a personal luxury. I think this is a luxury that can be done without. More importantly, the money could be used to help alleviate the current cost of living crisis.
