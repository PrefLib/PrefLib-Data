# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco to 21. However, it was also felt that this should be accompanied by a greater focus on educating young people on the dangers of tobacco use. It was felt that this would be a more effective way of preventing young people from starting to use tobacco products, rather than just making it more difficult for them to buy tobacco. It was also felt that the dangers of new technologies like e-cigarettes and vapes should be more widely advertised, particularly to young people, as these can also have serious health side affects. Legislation in these areas is particularly important when teenagers are one of the biggest users of vapes/e-cigarettes by age group.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Poll showing final result of consensus discussion
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a greater focus on educating young people on the dangers of tobacco use. This will be more effective in preventing young people from starting to use tobacco products than just making it more difficult for them to buy tobacco. However, the minimum age to purchase tobacco should also be raised to 21, in order to make it more difficult for young people to buy tobacco.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco to 21. However, it was also felt that this should be accompanied by a greater focus on educating young people on the dangers of tobacco use. It was felt that this would be a more effective way of preventing young people from starting to use tobacco products, rather than just making it more difficult for them to buy tobacco. This is particularly important in the light of recent technological developments that have made new, highly addictive and potentially damaging substances like vapes and e-cigarettes easily and readily available to teenagers and others.
