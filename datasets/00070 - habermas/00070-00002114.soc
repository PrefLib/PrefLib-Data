# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that school should not start at 9am and end at 5pm. This is because we feel that it is a very long day for children to be at school and they will not have enough free time to do other activities. It may also hinder their learning as they will not have enough time to do their homework and revise for exams. We do understand that it would be helpful for parents as it would tie in with their working hours, but we feel that it is more important for children to have a good work/life balance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the decision that school should not start at 9am and finish at 5pm. The main reasons for this are: 1. School is an important part of a child's life, but it is also important to balance the amount of time a child spends in school. A child will not be able to make the most of their education if they are overwhelmed and stressed by the amount of time they have to spend in school. This will make it harder for them to learn and therefore the whole point of school will be undermined. 2. The school day should not interfere with a child's social life. A child should be able to spend time with their friends and have free time to do recreational activities. 3. Parents should not have to choose between work and the well-being of their child. If a parent has to work 9-5 they should not be forced to leave their child to attend school for the majority of their day.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although the school day would be longer than the current school day, we think the school day should be 9am to 5pm. The main reasons for this is that parents working a 9-5 job would find it easier to pick their children up from school and it would tie in with their work hours. Also, the school day would then be the same as a working day, which would help prepare children for working life. This would also allow parents to save money on after-school clubs and after school childcare.

I spend half my day teaching, and half my day planning and writing lessons, or completing any other tasks that are required. Describe a typical day in the life of your organisation.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, because the children would be overwhelmed and would not have a good work/life balance. The children would also not have enough time to do their homework after school.
