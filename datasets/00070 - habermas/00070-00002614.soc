# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think we should invest more in science and research. Education and funding growth through learning will enrich our lives and our future. I think investing more in science and research may also help reduce the need for social services too. I truly value social services and think they're incredibly important so I only just sway towards science.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Its hard to say I think we should invest more in Science and Research, this is because science and research could find cures for diseases or even cancer. Some money should also be invested in social services to help people/families in need especially now with the cost of living crisis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should invest more in social services to help the most needy in our society
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: absolutely invest in science and research, as this is the future for humanity, if we invest now we're securing our future for the human race, research in scientific breakthroughs could help cure diseases, solve problems such as climate change and help with advances in AI.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: This is a very difficult question as both are important however I believe social services helps people right now, in the moment and so is more important to invest in than research that may or may not help people in the future. I do think that it is important to invest in science and research as this can discover cures for diseases etc etc, however to help people in the moment I believe that the benefits of investing in social services would be felt more widely.
