# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe the government should be allowed to buy land and give it to the poor. However, we do not agree with buying land from wealthy people and giving it to the poor, as this is unfair. Land should be bought by the government from areas that have no purpose or land that is going to waste. The government should provide more affordable housing for the poorer people and this could be built on this land. In the current system of property ownership the government can have to power to put restrictions on land and property in order to prevent wealthy people from privitizing areas of beauty, to prevent land from going to waste and to prevent land being hoarded. The aim of the government should be to create a balance in society and allow all to enjoy the land in a fair way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The government should be allowed to buy land and give it to the poor. This will help reduce social inequalities and provide a basic demand for human beings. The whole process should be transparent and accountable. Also, the government should only be allowed to buy land that is suitable and not green belt land. It should be land that has no other purpose or is going to waste of being hoarded. There needs to be more affordable housing for poorer people and this could be built on this land. The government would also have to pay towards this.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should be allowed to buy land and give it to the poor. The government should buy land that is suitable and not green belt land. The government should buy land that is going to waste or is being hoarded. The government should pay towards this. The government should be transparent and accountable. The government should provide safety for poors by way of purchasing lands and building safe houses. The aim is to balance amongst the community.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should be allowed to buy land and give it to the poor. This will allow for housing for poorer people, which in turn will help social equality.
