# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Absolutely. Certain breeds are just not meant to be domesticated animals. There have been a spate of dog attacks in the news recently about XL bully dogs and several deaths due to the powerful nature of these dogs. These dogs have massive jaws and can do so much damage. They really need to be banned.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: This is a complex and highly emotional topic. Recently in the UK, there has been a uptrend in owning bigger XL Bully type dogs which seem to be in the news regularly, resulting in life changing situations when these dogs attack humans. In recent months I have also seen several deaths of people trying to fend of big breed dogs. In my opinion, this tragic loss of life could be avoided if there were some restrictions on certain breed types which are known to be aggresive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think that all dog owners should be required to have a license and to be held fully accountable for their pet. There are however some breeds of dogs that I do not think are suitable to have as a pet. They can be unpredictable in their behaviour, no matter how good their relationship is with their owner, and this can sometimes have horrific consequences.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes, some breeds of dogs are inheriantly dangerous and bred for that reason. For example the XL bully is bred for it's agression, it's temperment ensures it will be violent and is too big with that mix to be safely around human 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: There is clear evidence that certain breeds of dogs are very dangerous - see the current issues happening in the UK with the American Bully XLs. Clearly these dogs are very dangerous. As these issues continue to happen and it is always the same breed, they should be banned.
