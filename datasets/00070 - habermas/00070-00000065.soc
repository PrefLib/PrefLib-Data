# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Politicians should not accept gifts of any kind. They should turn down any offer of a gift. They are already on a generous salary and should not need to accept gifts to get by. Also, accepting a gift could influence their vote or the way they approach a topic. The people elected to parliament should have the best interests of the country and its citizens at heart, not the company or person who has made them the gift.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No politician should be allowed to accept gifts and instead should turn it down or else donate it immediately to a charitable cause. This is not right and could result in corruption in the Government. The politicians have enough money and they should be banned from accepting any gifts and should also be named and shamed and kicked out if they do something like this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is the opinion of the group that it should be illegal for politicians to accept gifts from donors. This is because, by accepting gifts, it creates the potential for politicians to be bribed. This can result in politicians no longer acting in the people’s best interest and instead doing what they can to benefit the donor, even if it is to the detriment of others. This can cause corruption in politics and remove transparency from the political process, resulting in a society that is unfair and favours the few rather than the many.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the giving of gifts to politicians by the public is not a major issue. However, where gifts are being given to politicians by companies or lobby groups in order to sway them in some way, this is an issue. As politicians are in a position of power, they should not be accepting gifts as it could compromise their judgment and decision making. In this way, it is acceptable for the law to prevent them from receiving gifts. Gifts in the form of money are a more complicated issue. Politicians are generally very well paid, and as such, there is no real need for them to accept money gifts. However, money can be easily given in order to make politicians favor one decision over another, and as such it should not be accepted by them. This can cause problems for a politician if their friend is a business owner and gives them a gift. In this case, the politician would need to be able to show that the money was not given to them with any strings attached and that the friendship was genuine. In a sense, politicians are the same as any other citizen, and they have the right to receive gifts and to keep their own money. However, they also have the responsibility to be fair and just in
