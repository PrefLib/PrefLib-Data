# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the benefits of the generation of electricity in the short term outweigh the risks in the long term.  This is because, as one participant pointed out, our short term needs outweigh our long term needs.  As another participant pointed out, people in the past have felt this way about cigarettes and many other things that have later turned out to be bad for us.  However, at the moment we are not aware of the long term risks.  For example, it is still uncertain as to the long term effects of the disaster in Japan.  There are still many things that we don't know about the effects of radioactivity.  Therefore, as a participant pointed out, it is important that, while we continue to reap the short term benefits, we need to do research into the long term risks.  One participant pointed out that, even if the risks outweigh the benefits, the nuclear energy industry is such a big part of our society now, and we need to be aware of the risks but try to mitigate them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The long term risks from radioactivity from nuclear power plants are greater than the short term benefits from the generation of electricity.  While climate change is progressing and its effects are becoming more obvious, it is important to look to alternative major sources of energy, such as nuclear power, and ways of managing long term risks involved with them as other solutions are also sought.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although nuclear energy is a reliable form of renewable energy, it is extremely dangerous. This is because nuclear energy is not able to be controlled easily and the effects of nuclear energy cannot be fully predicted. The short term benefits of nuclear energy do not outweigh the long term risks and so nuclear energy should be avoided.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The long term risks from radioactivity from nuclear power plants are not greater than the short term benefits from the generation of electricity. Nuclear energy provides a reliable and clean source of electricity to communities around the world, however there is a risk of contamination if a nuclear reactor is damaged. By having security systems and monitoring the damage, the benefits of having electricity outweighs the risk. There are multiple cases of when a nuclear reactor has been damaged and nuclear energy has been able to provide the electricity needed. A positive example of this is Chernobyl, where despite the reactor exploding and causing an evacuation of the city of Pripyat, the plant is still being used and provides the electricity needed. While there are risks of nuclear energy, the benefits of nuclear energy outweigh the risk and therefore should be used.
