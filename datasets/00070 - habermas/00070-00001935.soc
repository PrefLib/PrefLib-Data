# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the use of animals in medical research is morally right. However, it is important to ensure that the animals are treated ethically and with respect. The animals should not be harmed or mistreated in any way and should be cared for in a humane manner. The use of animals in medical research is important to ensure that new drugs and treatments are safe for humans. The use of animals in medical research should be tightly regulated and there should be strict rules in place to ensure that the animals are not harmed or mistreated. The animals should be specifically bred for medical testing and not taken from the wild. The animals should be given appropriate respect and commemoration from the scientific community.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We generally agree with the draft consensus statement, however, we feel it is important to note that this is very much the first draft. We feel that it will be necessary to conduct more research in the future before this view can be properly justified and put into effect. Final consensus statement: _________________________________________________________________
