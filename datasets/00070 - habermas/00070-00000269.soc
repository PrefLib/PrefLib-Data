# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People with good reason, such as being persecuted in their country, or because they have skills that are in short supply should be able to immigrate to the UK. The UK is not big enough to allow everyone who wants to immigrate to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should be able to give anyone the opportunity to migrate to the UK, but they should not be allowed to stay if they are of a bad character, i.e. if they have a criminal record. This is to protect the safety of the people of the UK. If a person wants to come to the UK, they should be able to as long as they have a valid reason to be here, i.e. they have a skill that is in short supply, or they are unable to live safely in their current country. We are not a big country, so we should not be able to allow all people to come to the UK and stay for an unlimited amount of time. It is possible to become a citizen of the UK, which would allow someone to stay here and work for an unlimited amount of time.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of legal immigration, but with conditions. We felt that people should be able to immigrate if they have skills that are in short supply in the UK, or if they are unable to live safely in their current country. We felt that immigration should be limited to people who are able to contribute to the country, such as those with skills, and we didn't feel that unskilled workers should be allowed to immigrate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People should be able to legally immigrate to the UK, but only after certain requirements are met. They should not have any criminal record, and should be able to demonstrate that they can contribute to the UK by working. There should be no cap on immigration, but the Government should ensure that there are enough jobs, housing, medical services etc for people who do immigrate.
