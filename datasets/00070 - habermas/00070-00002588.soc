# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - This is not an area of expertise I have surrounding arts. But I believe that government funding could go on more pressing issues like NHS waiting lists and times, cancer treatment etc, more funding for schools and giving our children the best possible start in life. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, why would the government do so? There is plenty of other policies that need funding and arts should be last. A much as I appreciate the arts and the creativity of people, there are plenty of policies that need funding. The repeal of the Vagrancy Act is a important move for the UK but the Police/ authorities should still have the necessary funding to take action where drug use or violence is used. Funding should be used to help this cause. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, art is beautiful and allows people to be themselves - expressive, happy, entertaining and perform with freedom. We have so many immensely talented musicians, actors, performing artists, dancers etc. we should support their skill and give the platform to perform and succeed in their lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No i believe theres much more important things to be worrying about in the uks current situation and see absolutely no benifit of increasing the funding for arts 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I believe more funds should be made available for the arts but it doesn't have to be excessive. We see a lot of great art that comes about from modern technology, and so it might be a good option to make access to the technology easier.
