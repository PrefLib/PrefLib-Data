This is because, age or sex does not determine a customer's ability to pay for a product, and age or sex seems like completely arbitrary reasons to charge somebody for a product. This may also be open to abuse, for example if someone selling a product is sexist they may charge women more for products. Products should be charged at the same cost to everybody, regardless of age or gender.
