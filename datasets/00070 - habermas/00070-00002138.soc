# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, eating meat is not immoral. Humans are omnivores, and as such, it is part of our evolution to eat meat. There are many health benefits to eating meat, and it is a good source of protein. However, the way in which the meat is sourced is important. The participants agreed that it is important that the animals are treated well and are killed in a humane way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group was in agreement that eating meat is not immoral as there are some humans who survive on a purely carnivorous diet, and that it is part of our human evolutionary history. However, they were also in agreement that we as a society need to consider how we source our meat and the welfare of the animals we source it from. They acknowledged that some people feel that eating meat is immoral as it involves the death of another living being, however, they were in agreement that this is not a strong enough argument for them to come to the conclusion that eating meat is immoral.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, eating meat is not immoral. Humans have been eating meat for thousands of years and it is a large part of our evolution. There is also evidence that a carnivorous diet can be highly preventative towards certain conditions such as diabetes. However, it is important to treat the animals with respect and ensure that they are slaughtered in a humane way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Some people believe eating meat is wrong, others do not.
