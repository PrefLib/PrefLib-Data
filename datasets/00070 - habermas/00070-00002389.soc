# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the internal combustion engine is a very useful technology. It is very cheap to produce and maintain, and is a very reliable method of powering vehicles. However, they do cause a great deal of pollution, which is a major problem for the environment. It is for this reason that we believe that the sale of new internal combustion engines should be ended, and that the sale of used ones should be ended in the near future. We also believe that this should be done in conjunction with the creation of a more extensive public transport network, so that those who cannot afford electric vehicles can still travel around.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of ending the sale of new internal combustion engines. However, it was noted that the technology is useful and does provide several advantages over their electric counterparts. It was also noted that the internal combustion engine being used in the billions around the world every day is contributing to the enormous amounts of carbon in the air which is driving climate change. It was agreed that electrically powered vehicles do not produce these emissions and can be charged from renewable energy sources. It was also noted that it would be wrong to remove them completely as this would remove the choice of a petrol/gasoline car from users who may prefer this vehicle, it would also be bad for the oil economy and with the rising costs of electricity, people may not be able to afford to charge electric vehicles. It was agreed that combustion engines should be phased out as soon as possible and replaced with electric vehicles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While we recognise that combustion engines are not good for the environment, and that they should be replaced with electric vehicles, we also believe that the decision to ban them should not be taken lightly, and that the government should not act in haste. The move to electric vehicles is a major change for the world, and there are many factors that must be considered before making the change. The move would be very expensive, and would require major changes to infrastructure. We also believe that there should be more education on the subject, and that people should be made aware of the dangers of combustion engines.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: While the technology is incredibly useful and does provide several advantages over their electric counterparts, the internal combustion engine being used in the billions around the world every day is contributing to the enormous amounts of carbon in the air which is driving climate change. Electrically powered vehicles do not produce these emissions and can be charged from renewable energy sources. We believe that the sale of new internal combustion engines should be ended as soon as possible, however this should not be done in a way which removes the choice of a petrol/gasoline car from users who may prefer this vehicle, or which would be bad for the oil economy.
