# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK's electoral system is fair. However, there are improvements that can be made.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the UK's electoral system is fair. However, it is important to note that there are aspects of the system that could be improved. The first-past-the-post system ensures that constituents have a direct link with their representatives. However, it can lead to a lack of proportionality and potential biases in favour of larger parties. It is also important to note that there is a power imbalance between the two major parties, the Conservative and Labour parties, and the other parties. This can lead to a lack of choice for voters and can discourage people from voting for other parties.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK's electoral system is fair. However, it can be improved by implementing proportional representation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: While we all agree that our electoral system is essentially fair, there are some small ways in which it can be improved. The biggest way to improve the system is to allow immigrants/permanent settlers to vote on a national level. This would not only be fair but would also allow them to feel more involved and have a voice in the country they have chosen to call home. Another way to improve the electoral system is to allow young people to vote at 16. Many young people would like to vote as they feel they can engage with the electoral process and take a role in their country’s future.
