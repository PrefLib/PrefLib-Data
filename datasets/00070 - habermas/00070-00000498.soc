# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a tax on plastic bags but it is not a very effective method of dealing with the problem. A tax should be in place as it will raise money for charity but a complete ban on plastic bags should also be in place. This will discourage the use of plastic bags, and hopefully a culture change can occur. Plastic bags are also not an issue that we should be concentrating on, when there are other more polluting issues such as plastic bottles, single use packaging, and the amount of plastic we consume on a daily basis.  A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft of a consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement by the participants, and the final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Plastic bags are a huge problem in the world today, and we must try to reduce our reliance on them. The current solution of placing a 5p charge on single-use plastic bags in England has proven ineffective. The problem is still a huge one, and the plastic bags can still be bought. We believe that the best solution is a complete ban on single-use plastic bags, coupled with the encouragement of companies to use alternative methods of packaging. This would create a market for companies to produce recyclable materials, which would be more environmentally friendly. We believe that this would be the best solution.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Plastic bags should be banned in supermarkets and replaced by paper bags. The bags should also be free as they can be reused and are easily recycled. A tax on plastic bags should also be scrapped and replaced with an incentive for the consumer to use bags for life and the retailer to make all of their products out of recyclable materials. The tax is a fee for something which is damaging the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We feel that the tax on plastic bags is an inneffective way of solving the problem. Instead, plastic bags should be banned completely and tax on them should be scrapped. Plastic bags are still easily available and are still polluting the environment. We feel that a tax is ineffective as people can still buy the bags and will not want to use a bag for life. Companies such as Morrisons who use paper bags should be encouraged and there should be a drive for customers to bring their own bags for life.
