# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: There is no evidence to suggest that the world will end within the next 50 years. The world has been here for thousands of years and will continue to be here for thousands more. It is true that the world is in a fragile state at the moment due to climate change and other factors, but we believe that humans will take the necessary steps to protect the world. The world may become a worse place to live in but we don't think it will end.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We don't think the world will end in the next 50 years. The world has been here for millions of years and will continue to be here for millions more. The world may become a worse place to live in but we don't think it will end.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We don't think the world will end in the next 50 years. The world has been here for millions of years and will continue to be here for millions more. It is true that the world is in a fragile state at the moment due to climate change and other factors, but we believe that humans will take the necessary steps to protect the world. The world may become a worse place to live in but we don't think it will end. This is because the world has been here for millions of years and will continue to be here for millions more.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We don't think the world will end in the next 50 years. The world has been here for millions of years and will continue to be here for millions more. It is true that the world is in a fragile state at the moment due to climate change and other factors, but we believe that humans will take the necessary steps to protect the world. The world may become a worse place to live in but we don't think it will end. We are also aware that things could go in an unexpected direction that may cause the world to end but we don't think that this is likely.
