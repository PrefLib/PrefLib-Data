# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “In general, the group was in favour of free childcare. The group felt that the childcare should be free from a few months old as it is important for the child to bond with the parents at the beginning. The group felt that the childcare should be free to allow parents to get back to work and also create jobs for those whom look after the children. The group felt that it is important for the economy for parents to get back to work after having a child. The group felt that it would get parents back to work and also create jobs for those whom look after the children. The group felt that child costs are extortionate and the UK is one of the most expensive childcare systems in the world. The group felt that not only does getting a parent back to work help them emotionally, it is also a good example for a child to see this daily routine. However, the group also felt that it is important for the child to be able to bond with the parents at the beginning and that the government should subsidise childcare for all.”
