# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - National pride is something that can be both a good and a bad thing.  It is good in the sense that it can be an expression of love and loyalty to the place where we live.  It can be bad in the sense that it can be a force for division and conflict, and can lead to people feeling that their way of life is superior to others.  The challenge for us is to find ways to celebrate what is good about the UK, without making people feel that their way of life is inferior to others.  This means celebrating diversity, and the richness of different cultures and traditions.  It also means recognising that the UK is part of a wider world, and that we have a duty to work together with other nations to make the world a better place.  A key part of this is to recognise that we have a responsibility to protect the environment, and that this requires us to reduce our consumption of resources, and to develop alternative ways of living that are less damaging to the planet.

A key part of this is to recognise that we have a responsibility to protect the environment, and that this requires us to reduce our consumption of resources, and to develop alternative ways of living that are less damaging to the planet. The question for us to ask is, how can the principles and processes of a consensus process be used to help us achieve more national pride in a way that is not divisive?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should be doing more to encourage a greater degree of national pride.  However, the concept of national pride is a complex one.  It is good in the sense that it can be an expression of love and loyalty to the place where we live.  However, it can also be a force for division and conflict, and can lead to people feeling that their way of life is superior to others.

A key part of this is to recognise that we have a responsibility to protect the environment, and that this requires us to reduce our consumption of resources, and to develop alternative ways of living that are less damaging to the planet.  National pride should be something that everyone feels they can take part in, by helping to make their community a better place.
