# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We don't think that people should be encouraged to buy a home in London because the pricing of renting is extortionate and the availability of rented accommodation is getting smaller. The problem is the level of housing available for buyers. Also the large deposit can be difficult to save for if you are paying a high rent.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, people should not be encouraged to buy a home in London. This is because of the high prices of property and the fact that renting is very expensive in London as well. Therefore, it is better to buy in the country or in the suburbs of London where the prices are lower.
