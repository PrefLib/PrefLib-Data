# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050 and make every effort possible to meet this goal. If the target is not set or reached, I believe this would be as bad as criminal; refusing to act in the best interests of not just our own country, but the globe and all our children. The future is already looking very grim for the environmental future of the earth, it will be so much worse if we delay further. We already see the devastating effects of climate change at home and around the world, and the amount of carbon we pump into our atmosphere is a direct cause of that. While it is difficult to change how we power our country and the industrial processes we use, with enough effort we should have enough time to do it by 2050. The Government should be imposing even stricter rules and environmental taxes on the corporate environment, as it has been proven they are the biggest polluters. Absolutely, our current rate of emissions is unsustainable, and condemning future generations to suffer.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, the UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050. The future of our planet is at stake and we need to act now to stop climate change. The UK has a moral obligation to lead the way in the fight against climate change, and to set an example to other countries. We have the technology and the know-how to make this happen, and we should be doing everything in our power to make this happen. If we don’t, we will be condemning future generations to a life of misery.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Yes, the UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050 and be well on its way by 2030. The current rate of emissions is unsustainable, and condemning future generations to suffer. The Government should be imposing even stricter rules and environmental taxes on the corporate environment, as it has been proven they are the biggest polluters. We already see the devastating effects of climate change at home and around the world, and the amount of carbon we pump into our atmosphere is a direct cause of that. While it is difficult to change how we power our country and the industrial processes we use, with enough effort we should have enough time to do it by 2050. The UK and others should be aiming to hit this target as quickly as possible. The future is already looking very grim for the environmental future of the earth, it will be so much worse if we delay further.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050. We believe this is a realistic target that is achievable with the current technology and knowledge. This will require a huge effort from everyone in the country and a big change in the way we live our lives. It is of the utmost importance that we do this, as the future of the earth is at stake. If we do not act now, we will be condemning future generations to a life of suffering and struggle. We should be aiming to reach this goal as quickly as possible, as the longer we wait, the worse the situation will get.
