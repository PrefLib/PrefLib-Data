# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children should be given a free computer at the age of 6. This is because the world is becoming more and more digital and in order to keep up with the pace of the world, it is important for children to be exposed to computers and the internet from a young age. However, there are some concerns that the children may be exposed to adult content and become addicted to the computer. Therefore, the computer should be provided with some parental controls to ensure that the children are not exposed to adult content. In addition, children should be taught how to use the computer in a healthy way, so that they are not addicted to the computer. Discussion

In addition, children should be taught how to use the computer in a healthy way, so that they are not addicted to the computer. Parents should find a balance with their children between using a computer and being outside and socialising with peers. Children need read books and go outside as well  not only spend time on computer. The usage of the computers is paid attention under the control of the parents. It is crucial for children to not be exposed to adverse contents on internet. They do not know how to use in a healthy way, that is why the control of parents reveals the healthy way for children. Children should be allowed to access to computers with control.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - All children should be provided with a free computer at the age of 6. This is because the world is becoming more and more digital, and to keep up with the pace, it is important for children to be exposed to computers and the internet from a young age. This is also important as it enables children from all economic backgrounds to have access to the information and knowledge the internet can provide, therefore having all children on equal footing. However there are some concerns that the children may be exposed to adverse content on the internet, especially if they do not have parental supervision. Therefore, these computers should come with a program that automatically blocks the child from viewing any inappropriate websites. To be on the safe side, these computers should also be supplied with appropriate computer-based learning programs. In addition, children should be taught how to use the computer in a healthy way, so that they are not addicted to the computer.

However, there are some concerns that the children may be exposed to adult content and become addicted to the computer. Therefore, the computer should be provided with some parental controls to ensure that the children are not exposed to adult content. In addition, children should be taught how to use the computer in a healthy way, so that they are not addicted to the computer. Parents should also ensure that their children are spending enough time outside and socialising with their peers, and not spending all of their time on the computer.
