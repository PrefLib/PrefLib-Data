# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should give equal access to financial support for the self-employed and for those who work for employers, as they all pay into the system. The self-employed have the benefit of flexibility and potentially higher income, but they also have periods of low income when they are not working. Those who work for employers have more guaranteed income, and more protection in terms of hours and pay, but they have less flexibility in their work. The government should support all workers equally, whether they are self-employed or work for employers, as they all pay income tax and National Insurance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should support all workers equally, whether they are self-employed or work for employers, as they all pay income tax and National Insurance. The self-employed have the flexibility to earn more, but also have periods of financial hardship. Those who work for employers have more protections in terms of pay and hours, but have less flexibility. In general, the government should support all workers equally, whether they are self-employed or work for employers, as they all pay income tax and National Insurance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that financial support should be available equally to the self-employed and those who work for employers. Both the self-employed and the employed are equally responsible for paying income tax and National Insurance. The self-employed have advantages in flexibility and are able to set their own rates and hours, but may go for long periods without work. Those who work for employers have more protections and benefits such as pensions, sick pay, and minimum wage, but may not have the same flexibility as the self-employed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be equal financial support for the self-employed and those who work for employers. Both the self-employed and those who work for employers pay income tax and National Insurance, and so the government should support all workers equally. The self-employed have more flexibility with hours and pay, but also may go for long periods without work, and so periods of financial hardship should be supported by the government. Those who work for employers have more protection in terms of hours and pay, but may not have the same flexibility as the self-employed. In general, the government should support all workers equally, whether they are self-employed or work for employers, as they all pay income tax and National Insurance.
