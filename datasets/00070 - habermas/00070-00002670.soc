# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The internet has been a net positive for humanity. The internet has allowed for the free flow of information across the world. This has allowed for the sharing of knowledge and skills, as well as the sharing of news and entertainment. This has allowed for a more connected world. However, there are some negatives to the internet. The internet has allowed for the spread of misinformation, as well as allowing for the spread of hate speech. The internet has also allowed for the spread of dangerous ideologies. However, the positives of the internet outweigh the negatives. The internet has allowed for the sharing of knowledge and skills, as well as the sharing of news and entertainment. This has allowed for a more connected world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The internet has been a net positive for humanity. It has helped people keep in touch, make friends and communicate with people all over the world. It has educated people and with that has empowered and helped people who have learnt skills, further educated people who may not have had access to the internet. However for all positives there are negatives, which means vulnerable people can be taken advantage of and exploited. The internet has helped open up & connect the world in amazing ways, instant access to knowledge, communication, entertainment & work has meant it has all affected our lives in amazing ways.  We are using the internet right now as we do this survey!  GIving access to a wealth of information at the touch of a button, should be seen as a wonder of civilisation, I could go on my phone & search "Lincolnshire Cathedral" & find a wealth of information just on that subject. It doesn't mean it is without flaws, it can be a dangerous & violent thing also.  Glorifying past villains & honoring violent ideology.  But there are solutions to combatting these problems.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The internet has been a net positive for humanity. It has allowed people to discover new things from around the world. It has allowed people to be more educated on certain things. It allows people to interact with other people with similar interests around the world. However, the internet also leads to less security. People are able to spread misinformation disguised as facts. People also feel safer being mean over the internet so online bullying has increased. The internet has made the World, the workings of the World, it's people and resources more accessible to all. You can connect with people Globally and access information on anything at all. It is helping to reduce our Carbon footprint by reducing travelling as you can have virtual meetings from anywhere at all. It is not without it's disadvantgaes however. People's social skills may have been compromised and there is also the dark web which makes criminality easier and horrendous issues like people traffiking more accessible. I do feel that such crimes would still exist without the internet however and the advantages of the internet in controlling these crimes will balance it out. Overall I think it is positive.
