If they do not do so, the potential harm it can cause on children and their mental health is too large a risk to take. Parents need to know that when their children are on the internet, they may be exposed to pornography, even if unintentional. They also need to be able to talk to their children about pornography.

This is an important discussion for parents to have with their children, and it can be the difference between a life of sex addiction and a healthy relationship with sex.
