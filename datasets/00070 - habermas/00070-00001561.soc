# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of limiting the use of cars in central London. However, it was felt that a complete ban would not be practical and that there would need to be some exemptions. These exemptions would include emergency vehicles, taxis, and private vehicles for residents. The group felt that there would need to be a transition period to allow people to adjust to the new rules and that there would need to be a period of consultation with London residents and businesses to allow them to have their say on the matter.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While the pollution that is generated by cars is unhealthy for the environment, completely banning cars in central London is not the right solution to this problem. A ban on cars would be very disruptive for people's lives and in London where a large proportion of people live in apartments, it is not practical to store cars outside of the city. In addition to this, there are other forms of transport which contribute to pollution, such as trains, buses, and taxis, so cars should not be the only form of transport that is targeted for a ban. Instead, we feel that cars should be limited and encouraged to be kept to a minimum. This could be achieved through a tax on parking, stricter emission standards and further incentives for people to use alternative methods of transport such as walking, cycling or taking public transport.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not ban cars in central London. The use of all motor vehicles should be reduced as much as possible in all built up areas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a ban on cars in central London.
