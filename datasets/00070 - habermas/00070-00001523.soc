# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the decision that it is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. We believe that this would be discriminatory and therefore immoral. We believe that the price of a product should be calculated based on the cost of manufacturing the product, any overheads and costs, plus a profit margin. This cost does not increase dependent on age or sex, so the cost they pay should not increase. It is legally wrong to discriminate against someone on the grounds of gender or age and this is discrimination. We also believe that it is not acceptable to charge a lower price for those belonging to a minority, for simply being one.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, it is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. This would be discrimination and could be seen as morally wrong. It would be difficult to predict how much someone is able to spend on something simply based on age or sex, and it would be a highly discriminatory practice. A fixed price for everyone is more fair.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that charging different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex is not a morally acceptable practice. We see that charging differently is a discriminatory act and is a violation of human rights. The cost of a product should be based on the material cost, the overheads, and the profit margin. None of these will change with the age or sex of the customer, so the cost to the customer should not change.
