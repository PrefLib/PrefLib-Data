# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Vaccination is a key tool in preventing the spread of diseases and viruses and thus is of crucial importance to society. That said, the vaccines themselves need to be extensively tested and the potential risk and benefits assessed before vaccination is made mandatory. The spread of misinformation and fake news has also increased the public's concerns about the safety of vaccines. Hence, communication with the public about the safety of vaccines is also of crucial importance to gain public trust.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Most vaccinations have a higher benefit than risk. The side effects of vaccinations are usually only short term and the benefits of vaccinations are usually greater than the possible negative side effects.

For example, the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine has led to a 99% reduction in measles cases since the introduction of the MMR vaccine in 1988. Other positive things about vaccinations is that they are safe.  In most cases they have very few side effects.  There is no scientific evidence that vaccinations cause autism. Negatives:  Although most vaccinations are safe, there is a chance that they can cause side effects.  These can include swelling, a rash and a high temperature.   Vaccinations contain
