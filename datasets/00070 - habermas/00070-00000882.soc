# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of voting being compulsory in local elections. The argument put forward was that voting is an important part of a democracy and if people do not vote, they are not taking an active part in the democracy. If voting was made compulsory, this would lead to a higher voter turnout, and therefore a more representative democracy. However, there were arguments against this. The group felt that forcing people to vote was undemocratic, and that people should be able to choose whether they want to vote or not. The group felt that people who do not vote are not necessarily apathetic, and that they may have valid reasons for not voting.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of people being encouraged to vote, however we did not think that it should be compulsory as this could be seen as undemocratic. We felt that voting was an important part of a democracy, however if people do not wish to vote then they should not be forced to do so. We felt that local elections are important as they can be seen as a barometer for general elections and therefore people should be encouraged to vote. We also felt that people should be encouraged to vote as it is important for people to have their say and to make their voices heard.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that it should not be compulsory to vote in local elections. We believe that this is the case because it is not fair to force people to vote, especially when many people are apathetic towards politics and have no opinion on the matter. We believe that democracy is about freedom of choice and forcing people to vote goes against this idea. However, we believe that people should be encouraged to vote, and that there should be more information and education about politics to help people make more informed choices. We also believe that there should be more campaigning and advertising about local elections, as people are generally more aware of general elections.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of compulsory voting in local elections. The group felt that in a democracy, it is the right of every citizen to have their say and that this right is only given substance through voting. The group felt that if voting is not compulsory, then there is the possibility of a large proportion of the population not voting, thus making the election result less representative of the true will of the people. The group felt that it is the duty of every citizen to vote and that this duty should be enforced through law. The group felt that there is a balance to be struck between enforcing this duty and respecting the freedom of the individual. The group felt that the current situation where voting is not compulsory is a reasonable compromise between these two positions. The group felt that the current situation is acceptable, but that it should be a goal of the government to increase voter turnout in local elections and that the possibility of making voting compulsory should be considered.
