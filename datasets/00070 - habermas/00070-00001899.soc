# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of Doctors being allowed to prescribe cannabis for medicinal purposes. The group felt that there are some cases where it can provide relief to some people with some conditions and should be an option. The group also felt that Doctors need to be allowed to make this judgement for themselves and should not be hindered by the law if they feel it would benefit the patient. The group did discuss that there should be strict controls around the prescribing of cannabis and that patients should be monitored closely and that doctors should be restricted to only prescribing in certain situations.  The group felt that there should be other options available before cannabis is prescribed, but that it should be an option. The group felt that doctors would be the best people to be allowed to make this decision and that it should be their professional judgement as to whether cannabis would be beneficial to their patient.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of doctors being allowed to prescribe cannabis for medicinal purposes.  It was felt that cannabis could be of great benefit to people suffering from a variety of conditions, particularly those who have not responded to other treatments.  It was also felt that cannabis could be of great benefit to people suffering from mental health problems.  However, it was also felt that cannabis could be very dangerous if misused, and that it could lead to addiction.  It was also felt that there should be very strict guidelines in place to ensure that cannabis is only prescribed in the right circumstances and that it is not open to abuse.  It was felt that cannabis should only be prescribed as a last resort, when all other treatments have failed.  It was also felt that cannabis should only be prescribed by a specialist doctor, and that the patient should be closely monitored to ensure that they are using it properly and that it is having the desired effect.  It was also felt that cannabis should only be prescribed for a limited period of time, and that the patient should be weaned off it gradually.  It was also felt that cannabis should not be prescribed for recreational use, and that it should only be prescribed for medicinal purposes.
