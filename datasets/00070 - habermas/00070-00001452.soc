# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group unanimously agreed that in order to take a sabbatical, individuals must be able to prove that it will benefit their career and it should not be viewed as a holiday.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should be able to take a sabbatical from their job for 3 months to pursue another project. However, it is important to have a notice period of 3 months to allow the business to prepare for the absence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, we agree that the option to take a career sabbatical should be an easier process as the break should be viewed as an opportunity to develop an additional skillset or experience to a role.  It also can have positive benefits to an employees wellbeing which can also benefit the workplace. We feel that the positive impacts of this outweigh the negative, and the problems could be mitigated with notice periods, and help in finding cover, or the ability to use previously booked holiday to cover the period.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of making it easier for people to take a sabbatical from their job for three months to pursue another project. This is because it would allow people to pursue their passions and interests, which would in turn make them happier and more fulfilled. This is important because people are spending most of their lives in education and work, and they deserve to take some time to do things they love and learn more about themselves. This would also be good for society as a whole, as it would foster creativity and innovation. The group did, however, feel that there should be some sort of notice period for people taking a sabbatical, so that employers can make arrangements to cover for them. The group also felt that this would be more feasible for some sectors than others. For example, it would be more feasible for office workers than for medical staff or childcare workers, who would need to be in ratio.
