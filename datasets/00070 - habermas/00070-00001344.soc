# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No wild animal should be kept as a pet, even if bred in captivity. A wild animal, even if semi domesticated will still have the instincts of its natural behaviours which presents a danger to any human. It is also cruel to keep a wild animal as a pet. The animal is taken away from its natural habitat and is forced to live in a home where it is not suited to. The animal may also become aggressive and lash out at its owners or anyone who comes into contact with it. This could result in injury or death. The animal may also become depressed and stressed as it is not living in its natural habitat. This could also result in injury or death.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No wild animal should be kept as a pet, even if bred in captivity. This is because a wild animal, even if semi domesticated will still have the instincts of its natural behaviours which presents a danger to any human. It is also cruel to keep a wild animal as a pet. The animal is taken away from its natural habitat and is forced to live in a home where it is not suited to. The animal may also become aggressive and lash out at its owners or anyone who comes into contact with it. This could result in injury or death. The animal may also become depressed and stressed as it is not living in its natural habitat. This could also result in injury or death. Conclusion I believe that this experience of using a digital tool to achieve a consensus view on a given question was well worth the time put into it. I think that as a critical thinker this tool will help me in the future to break down complicated topics and come up with my own opinion on these topics. Before I came into the class I was of the opinion that this class would not be a good fit for me but now I am truly enjoying the challenges and debates that are happening in the class and have become a critical thinker.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No wild animal should be kept as a pet, even if bred in captivity. A wild animal, even if semi domesticated will still have the instincts of its natural behaviours which presents a danger to any human. It is also cruel to keep a wild animal as a pet. The animal is taken away from its natural habitat and is forced to live in a home where it is not suited to. The animal may also become aggressive and lash out at its owners or anyone who comes into contact with it. This could result in injury or death. The animal may also become depressed and stressed as it is not living in its natural habitat. This could also result in injury or death. Wild animals need to live in a wild environment, not a small home with a member of the human race who may also look after a dog or cat. They have many different instincts, needs and personalities and need to be with their own kind.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No wild animal should be kept as a pet, even if bred in captivity. A wild animal, even if semi domesticated will still have the instincts of its natural behaviours which presents a danger to any human. It is also cruel to keep a wild animal as a pet. The animal is taken away from its natural habitat and is forced to live in a home where it is not suited to. The animal may also become aggressive and lash out at its owners or anyone who comes into contact with it. This could result in injury or death. The animal may also become depressed and stressed as it is not living in its natural habitat. This could also result in injury or death. The animal would be better suited to being looked after in a sanctuary or a zoo away from close human interaction so they can keep their wild instincts and remain in a semi natural habitat.
