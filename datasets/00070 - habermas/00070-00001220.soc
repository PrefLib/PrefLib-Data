# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of a carbon tax being imposed. The group felt that a carbon tax would encourage businesses to look at their carbon footprint and would encourage them to be more energy efficient. It was felt that this would lead to a reduction in the amount of pollution and would encourage businesses to use more environmentally friendly alternatives. It was felt that the tax would be more beneficial to the environment than the government would be to the economy. However, the group felt that the tax would be more beneficial to the economy if the money raised was invested in developing more environmentally friendly alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group was in general agreement that any funds raised by a carbon tax should be put to good use. In order to be able to properly measure the impact of such a tax, the money raised from this tax should be ring fenced and only spent on the benefit of the environment, specifically on the development of green energy sources. In order for such a tax to be fair, it is important that the government also implements measures to increase funding to support those on low incomes as there is a risk that those who are already struggling financially will be adversely affected by any increase in their living costs. It was agreed that the money raised from this tax should be used to fund research into green energy sources as well as supporting businesses who are already working in this area.  It was felt that this would be the best way to encourage businesses to look at more environmentally friendly ways of working and would be of benefit to the environment in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although there are a number of factors to take into consideration, we feel that the government should implement a carbon tax to businesses that emit high levels of carbon emissions.  The tax should be imposed on companies that emit carbon into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels in order to produce goods, transport goods, or provide services.  We also feel that the tax should be implemented gradually over a 5 year period.  As well as this, we believe that the money raised through the tax should be invested in R&D to develop environmentally friendly ways of producing goods, transporting goods, and providing services that do not emit carbon emissions into the atmosphere.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of imposing a carbon tax. However, the group did agree that if a carbon tax was to be imposed, then the money raised should be used to fund 'green' initiatives that will be of benefit now and in the future and will encourage entrepreneurs to concentrate their efforts on projects that will make a real positive impact on the environment.
