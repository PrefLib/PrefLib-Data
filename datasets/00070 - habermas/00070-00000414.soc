# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The participants do not agree with the government banning all animal products, however we do think that it is correct for the government to regulate animal welfare. This should be done to protect the animals from suffering unnecessarily, whilst still allowing humans to consume products made from animals in a way that does not cause them undue suffering. This should be done to preserve the livelihood of millions of people across the country that rely on these products for income and to preserve the health of the general population. We are unsure how the government would be able to ban all animal products, and we believe it would be detrimental to the economy and the livelihoods of people. The participants believe that animal products are important and therefore should not be banned.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was surprised by how polarised views on this issue were and had trouble understanding where each person was coming from. However, it was agreed that the welfare of animals is extremely important and should be taken into consideration by governments and citizens alike. It was also agreed that animal products are a large part of the human diet and it would be detrimental to health if they were to be removed completely.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should not ban all animal products. Animal products are natural and have been eaten by human beings for thousands of years. There are ways of creating animal products that are humane, so there is no need for animals to suffer unnecessarily.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a ban on all animal products. However, this would be hard to implement and would have to be done in stages.
