# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should definitely restrict the right of individuals to own handguns. In the US there are less restrictions and more gun crime, which suggests that a lack of restrictions leads to an increase in gun crime. Tighter controls on gun ownership are required. We need to make sure that those who have guns have been subject to a mental health check and a background check. The mental health check should be regular and include drug testing. A gun is a weapon, and people should only have access to them when absolutely necessary. The weapons should be licensed and registered to the local authority and only stored in a gun safe when not in use. Only one gun should be owned and there should be no other gun ammo stored in the house.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the right of individuals to own handguns should be restricted. This is because the UK has seen a decrease in gun crime since the introduction of tighter gun laws and this is something we should be proud of. It is also something that we should not let slip. We have also seen that in countries with looser gun laws, such as the USA, gun crime is higher. This is because guns are easier to get hold of and so more people will use them to commit crimes. In the UK, the majority of people who own guns are hunters and farmers. This means that the guns are used for sport or work purposes and are not used to commit crimes. We believe that people who own guns should be subject to background checks and should be required to have a license. The license should be renewed every year and the person should be subject to a mental health check. This is to ensure that the person is fit to own a gun and is not a danger to themselves or others. We believe that this is a good system that works well in the UK. We do not believe that it should be changed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be strict rules governing the ownership of handguns. These rules should include extensive background checks on the person wishing to own a handgun and a mental health assessment. The person should also have to justify why they need to own a handgun.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that there should be a restriction on the right of individuals to own handguns. We believe that the law in this country is stricter than in other countries and that there are fewer incidents of gun crime here because of it. We also think that if there were more restrictions on who can own guns in other countries then there would be fewer incidents of gun crime there too. We feel that owning a gun should be a privilege and not a right and that a person's criminal record and mental health should be evaluated before they are allowed to own one and this should be regularly reviewed.
