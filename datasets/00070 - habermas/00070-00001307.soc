# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of reducing carbon emissions to a certain point. This is because complete decarbonisation is an ambitious and difficult goal to achieve. However, we must also consider that we are currently on a path of increasing carbon emissions. Therefore, the group also agreed that we should aim for a complete decarbonisation in the future, but we must also consider the cost of this to the global economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe the most feasible option would be to reduce carbon emissions to a certain point, because it would not be completely bad for the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While the science of climate change shows that a move to a carbon neutral economy is essential to avoid dangerous climate change, we recognise that this will not be an easy task. We believe that there are significant societal, political and economic challenges that must be addressed in order to reach this goal. We therefore believe that it is important to set a realistic but ambitious target for carbon emission reductions. This should be based on a scientifically robust model of climate change, and should be consistent with efforts to improve air quality, energy security and other important environmental goals. In order to achieve this ambitious target, an appropriate policy mix must be used to address the issues of fairness and sustainability. This could include carbon pricing, technology development and innovation, and effective adaptation measures for vulnerable groups and regions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In the long term, the goal must be to completely decarbonise. The way in which we get there is a difficult question, and there will be a number of compromises that will need to be made. It is likely that we will have to reduce carbon emissions to a certain point, and then reassess the situation from there. It is also important to consider the needs of developing countries, and how decarbonisation will affect them. It is likely that the burden of decarbonisation will fall most heavily on developed countries, and this will need to be considered in any agreement.
