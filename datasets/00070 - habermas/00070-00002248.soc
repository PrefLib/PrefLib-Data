# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of banning the sale of large fizzy drinks over the counter in UK stores. It was felt that this would not be an effective way to combat obesity and other health problems caused by the consumption of fizzy drinks. Instead, it was felt that a better way to combat this would be to educate people about the risks involved in consuming fizzy drinks, and to encourage people to make healthier choices.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It was agreed that the negative health effects caused by fizzy drinks are more significant than the benefits they provide. It was agreed that this is a huge issue as a lot of young people consume them regularly. However, we do not believe that banning them outright would be the most effective way of dealing with the problem. Instead, we believe that a more effective approach would be to introduce measures to raise awareness of the problems caused by fizzy drinks, including information on their calorific value. In addition, we believe that some steps could be taken to make them less accessible to young people. It was also agreed that other options should be considered, such as taxing the manufacturers or increasing the price.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to a ban on the sale of large fizzy drinks. The group felt that it was the responsibility of the individual to make an informed choice and that a ban on the sale of large fizzy drinks would not solve the problem of obesity. The group felt that the best way to tackle obesity was through education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe the government should regulate the amount of sugar in fizzy drinks. This will reduce the amount of sugar, which in turn reduces obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. It is also important to educate people on the dangers of excessive sugar consumption.
