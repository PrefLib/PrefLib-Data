# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “After a debate, we came to the consensus view that people earning more than £150,000 per year should be subjected to a higher band of income tax. With the current trend of job growth and new technology-led services, the gap between the rich and poor is widening. It is imperative that we incentivize people to work hard, but it is also equally important to help the needy. The rich are best suited to help the needy. Therefore, higher earners should be taxed at a higher rate, so the state can generate more funds to build better hospitals, schools and take care of the homeless. We should keep this at a fair rate though, which could be up to 50% of the additional income above £150,000. This means that someone earning £300,000 a year would pay an extra £50,000 of tax and would still have enough for a comfortable life.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that there should be higher rates of income tax for those earning more than £150,000 per year. The reason for this is that they would be able to contribute more for public services and common good in the shape of government projects and initiatives, while still have more than enough for a comfortable life. It feels unfair that the highest earners would be taxed the same as the lower earners. With taxing taxpayers proportionately with their earnings, the public services would receive a boost, while the higher taxpayers would not experience a noticeable drop in life quality.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that a higher rate of income tax should be imposed for those earning more than £150,000 per year. This is because they are already taxed a high amount and can afford to contribute more to the community.
