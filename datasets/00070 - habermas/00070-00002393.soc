# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK is not too small to remain an independent nation in a globalised world. The UK is a very small country in terms of geographical size and population, however it has a very strong economy and has accumulated vast amounts of material and non-material wealth throughout history. It is an important player in geopolitical power relations and has positioned itself as a leading nation. The UK has a lot to offer the world and is not at a loss if it gets help from other countries. It should value the help of other countries and appreciate how countries can all help each other instead of letting pride get in the way and saying we are an independent nation. We have a lot of offer to other countries and we should also be humble enough to realise the benefit from other countries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In a globalised world, the UK is not too small to remain an independent nation. The UK has a lot to offer the world in terms of culture, economy, and heritage.

It should not let pride get in the way and refuse help from other countries. The UK should not be afraid to ask for help from other countries. The UK should appreciate how countries can all help each other instead of letting pride get in the way and saying we are an independent nation. We have a lot of offer to other countries and we should also be humble enough to realise the benefit from other countries.
