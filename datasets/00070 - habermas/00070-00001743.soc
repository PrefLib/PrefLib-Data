# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While it is important for individuals of a certain age to be allowed to vote in our democracy, we do not feel it is right to lower the voting age to 16. This is because we feel that individuals should have a clear understanding of politics and understand the impact that the parties will have on them in order to make an informed decision. While we do believe that some individuals may be able to do this, it is more likely that most individuals will not be able to do this. The individuals may be politically literate, but the importance of the parties may not be as relevant as the issues of age such as money and housing. In regards to online voting, we feel that it should not be used as the main form of voting. This is because there are a number of security issues surrounding the online system, and we feel that there should be a physical process as well as this. In regards to the current voting system, we feel that it is fair and works in an effective manner. However, we do feel that there should be a review into the voting system, and that it should be changed to a system that will include all of the smaller parties, such as the second vote system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The current voting system is fair and works in an effective manner, however it could be enhanced by incorporating some new features, such as a website designed for voters that has all the relevant information on the parties and specific issues, and also information on parties and individuals, from newspapers and resources that offer unbiased information. Young adults should not be able to vote at 16, as it is unlikely that they will be mature enough and informed enough to do so. We do not support online voting, as we have reservations about the security of it and our fear is that it could become corruptible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We agree that the current voting system is fair and should not be changed. However, there should be a review into the voting system. We feel that it should be changed to a system that will include all of the smaller parties, such as the second vote system, and that more information should be made available for individuals when they are voting.
