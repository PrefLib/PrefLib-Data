# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: In general, the group was in favour of keeping the term sexual harassment. The group felt that the term sexual harassment is a more serious term and one that is widely recognised. Some people felt that unwanted sexual attention could be used as an umbrella term for a range of behaviours, with sexual harassment being one of the more serious behaviours.

The group felt that unwanted sexual attention could be used as an umbrella term for a range of behaviours, with sexual harassment being one of the more serious behaviours. Additionally, the group felt that because the term sexual harassment is already widely recognised it should be kept as it is. Participant critiques of different models: Sexual harassment as a form of intimate partner violence: Group members discussed how the term sexual harassment has previously been regarded as synonymous with intimate partner violence. This interpretation could have damaging consequences for both intimate partner violence and sexual harassment by blurring the lines between the two. Intimate partner violence and sexual harassment are both crimes, with different manifestations and would be best tackled as individual problems as opposed to one blended problem. Regulation, Sexual Harassment and power: The group discussed how one way sexual harassment has previously been conceptualised is as regulation of women.
