# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group have come to the consensus view that we should not be taxed when we inherit money as the government tax us when we earn it and again when we inherit it and that is not fair. It would be fairer to eliminate this tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of inheritance tax being removed. The main argument for this was that the tax had already been paid on the money when it was earned, so it should not be taxed again when it is passed on. The group felt that inheritance tax was unfair, as it penalised those who had worked hard and saved money. The group felt that it was wrong that the government should be able to take money from the family of someone who had died.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I believe the government should eliminate inheritance tax as it is not fair that the beneficiaries have to pay the tax on the inheritance they have received when it has already been taxed when it was earned. The inheritance is also not a burden to the tax payers of the country as the deceased has already paid his/her taxes throughout their life and the money is for the family who will have to go through the trauma of losing a loved one and I think they should be left to grieve without having to worry about taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of abolishing inheritance tax. This was because inheritance tax is a tax on money that has already been taxed and therefore it is unfair to tax it again. It was also felt that inheritance tax is a disincentive to people who want to save for their retirement and for their families. However, it was felt that there are some circumstances in which inheritance tax is a good idea. For example, if a person has made their money by illegal means then it is right that their family should not benefit from this money. The group also felt that inheritance tax should not be abolished completely but that the threshold should be raised to a higher level.
