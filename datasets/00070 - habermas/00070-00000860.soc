# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Businesses with more than 500 employees should be required to publish gender pay gaps. The participants agreed that this would help to address the issue of gender discrimination and would help to prevent it in the future. The participants also agreed that this would help to highlight businesses that are discriminating and would allow them to be named and shamed. The participants felt that this would help to ensure that businesses are being fair and transparent and would help to provide a level playing field for both men and women in the workplace.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Businesses with more than 500 employees should be required to publish gender pay gaps. The following reasons were cited to support this view. Firstly, it is important to know how businesses treat their employees, and the more employees a business has the more important it is to know how they treat them. Secondly, the more employees a business has the more likely it is that they are paying some employees more than others for the same work. Thirdly, the more employees a business has the more likely it is that they are paying some employees less than others for the same work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Companies with more than 500 employees should be required to publish gender pay gaps. This is because gender discrimination is still a huge problem in the UK and companies should be forced to publish gender pay gaps in order to reduce the discrimination. The problem is that companies are not forced to publish this information, and so the problem continues. If companies were forced to publish this information, it would be a step in the right direction towards reducing the discrimination. This would also mean that companies who discriminate would be named and shamed, and would hopefully reduce the discrimination.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Companies with more than 500 employees should be required to publish gender pay gaps. The way that the current economy is structured is unfair and unequal and gender pay gaps are one symptom of this. The issue of gender pay gaps is an issue of inequality. If men and women are doing the same job, they should be paid the same. There should be no excuse for a gender pay gap. We need to change the system so that it is more equal. We need to work towards a more equal society where gender pay gaps are a thing of the past.
