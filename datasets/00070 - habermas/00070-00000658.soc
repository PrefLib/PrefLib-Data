# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that it is okay to eat genetically modified foods. We think that the risks are minimal and that the benefits of genetically modified food are great. This is because GM foods are highly resistant to pests, they have a better shelf life, they are more appealing to eat, and they have a similar nutritional value to non-GMO foods. However, we believe that GM foods should be labelled as such, so that consumers can make an informed choice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the conclusion that it is okay to eat genetically modified foods. We think that the risks are minimal and that the benefits of genetically modified food are great. This is because GM foods are highly resistant to pests, they have a better shelf life, they are more appealing to eat, and they have a similar nutritional value to non-GMO foods. We think that this is a good thing because the food can be sold at a lower price and because it is resistant to pests it is less likely to be wasted. However, we think that it is important that the food is labelled as GMO so that people know what they are eating.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that it is okay to eat genetically modified foods. We think that the risks are minimal and that the benefits of genetically modified food are great. This is because GM foods are highly resistant to pests, they have a better shelf life, they are more appealing to eat, and they have a similar nutritional value to non-GMO foods.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that it is okay to eat genetically modified foods. We think that the risks are minimal and that the benefits of genetically modified food are great. This is because GM foods are highly resistant to pests, they have a better shelf life, they are more appealing to eat, and they have a similar nutritional value to non-GMO foods. We also believe that the foods should be labelled as GMO or not so that people are aware of what they are eating.
