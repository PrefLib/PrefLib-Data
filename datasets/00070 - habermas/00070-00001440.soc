The participants also felt that it would be difficult to monitor who is buying the food and therefore difficult to monitor who is paying the tax. The participants felt that the NHS should be funded by income tax, as this is a fairer way of raising money as those who earn more, pay more. The participants also felt that it would be easier to monitor who is paying the tax, as it is linked to an individuals income.
