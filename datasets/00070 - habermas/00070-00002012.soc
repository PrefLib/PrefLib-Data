# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although immigration should be controlled, it shouldn't be banned. If there is a surplus of housing, jobs, schools and healthcare facilities in the UK, then there shouldn't be a problem with immigration. Immigration should also be monitored to ensure it doesn't go out of control.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, immigration should be restricted. The world is facing a crisis in overpopulation and it is important that we do not exacerbate the problem. Immigration should be allowed for those who are able to contribute to the economy and who will not be a burden on the state. It is important to remember that immigration is a two-way street and we should not be afraid to restrict immigration from countries who do the same to us.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of immigration. However, we all agreed that there should be some restrictions. We all agreed that people should be allowed to immigrate if they can prove they want to and are capable of working and paying taxes. People should not be allowed to immigrate if they are planning on taking benefits of the country they are not citizens at. We also believe that Governments should regularly review job professions struggling to hire (fruit picking, hospitality, healthcare etc. ) and provide list of desired professions every few months. People who don't have experience but want to gain it should be allowed a 3 month period in a country to prove their willingness to work and learn.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While the UK economy is strong and unemployment is at record low, we believe that immigration should be restricted. Our view is that UK is reaching a point of 'over-saturation' and there are more people than jobs. If a country is over-saturated, it is the locals who lose out - more competition for jobs, and housing, increased strain on public services, increased crime rates. For this reason, immigration should be restricted. If the UK economy starts to decline, however, it would be a mistake to keep immigration restricted - there is a risk that if too many people leave the UK (immigrants, or otherwise), we will end up in an even worse situation. In this case, immigration should be opened to any person who is willing to work and be an asset to the country, without relying on the state for support. The UK is currently facing a difficult situation. There are more people than jobs. If this situation continues, it is the locals who will suffer. We believe it is our responsibility to protect our own people and protect their livelihoods. This means that immigration should be restricted until the situation changes. However, we believe that the Government should keep a close eye on the situation and
