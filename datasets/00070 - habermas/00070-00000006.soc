# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although Churchill was a divisive figure, he was instrumental in defeating the Nazi's in WW2 and also served as prime minister twice in the UK. Churchill was key in fighting against fascism and should be commended for his actions in this regard.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, Britain should not remove the statue of Winston Churchill from Parliament Square. Churchill was instrumental in ensuring that the Nazi's were defeated in world war 2 and he should therefore be given credit for that. However, he also made some bad errors when it came to the famine in Bhopal  which led to millions of people dying. Also, he allowed Kenyan people to be tortured. I therefore believe that he did some good and bad things and consequently do not have a strong opinion on whether he should be glorified or not. A statue is in any case not something I personally care much about.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Winston Churchill was a hero of the Second World War, and although we acknowledge that he has been responsible for racist views, removing his statue is not the right thing to do, because he is an important part of British history.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The citizen's jury accepts that Winston Churchill was instrumental in defeating Nazi Germany and is a hugely significant part of British history. We also accept that his actions during the Bengal famine were wrong and led to a huge loss of life. The citizen's jury is split on the idea of Churchill as a hero but accepts that the statue should remain in place to recognise Churchill's impact on British history.  We are happy to keep it but believe that the plaque attached to the statue should be changed to include information about Churchill's actions in Bengal.
