# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the decision that the NHS should be free for everyone. We think that the NHS is a basic human right and should be available for everyone. We think that it is important that everyone is treated equally and that people are not judged on their social class or how much money they have. We think that it is important that everyone has access to the NHS, even if they are not paying taxes, as they may not be able to afford to pay taxes. We think that the NHS is a basic human right and that everyone should have access to it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Everyone should have access to the national health service. The health of everyone is the most important and as the national health service is there for everyone it should not matter what you do or where you are from, it should be there for everyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Everyone should have access to the NHS. The group felt that this was a basic human right and that no one should be denied this service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Everyone should have access to the national health service. The health of everyone is the most important and as the NHS is paid for through the taxes of everyone who lives in the UK, everyone should have access. It would be unfair for anyone to be denied this, especially if they are unable to afford private health care. Of course, there should be limits. Some people might try to abuse the NHS for their own gain. However, everyone should be able to access it, because everyone should be able to afford it. The NHS was set up for the health and benefit of everyone, not just a select few. It was a good system when it was set up, but now it needs to be updated to allow for everyone to be treated.
