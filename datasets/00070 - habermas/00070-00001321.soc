# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Businesses should be required to allow workers to take more holidays.  This is because workers who are able to take more holidays will be happier and more productive.  Businesses that allow workers to take more holidays will also benefit from a more motivated workforce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Businesses should be required to allow workers to take more holidays. The current minimum number of holidays is simply not enough to accommodate the demands of modern life. Allowing workers the flexibility to take more holidays would make it easier to accommodate the demands of modern life. Families with working spouses would find this beneficial when it comes to childcare over holiday periods. For individuals without childcare commitments, it would enable them to make a trade-off between income and free time. A happier, healthier workforce actually results in a more productive workforce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Businesses should be required to allow workers to take more holidays. If employees are unhappy at work, the business will suffer in the long run. On top of that, we need to place more importance on our mental health and well-being, and one way of doing that is to allow people to take more time off work to spend with family and friends.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While it is important for individuals to have more free time to pursue their personal lives, we also need to recognise that businesses also have their own rights. Businesses should not be forced to allow workers to take more holidays if it would hurt their bottom line. It is also worth recognising that businesses that treat their workers well are more likely to receive better performance from their workers. However, workers who work in businesses that cannot afford to give them more holidays should not be punished. Workers in this situation should be given some sort of incentive such as the right to accrue more holidays so that they may enjoy a more relaxing lifestyle in the future.
