# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Is it okay to use artificial intelligence to make important decisions?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was not in favour of using artificial intelligence to make important decisions. However, the group felt that it was important to ensure that the AI was making decisions based on sound logic and that it was not being fed any false information. The group also felt that it was important to ensure that the AI was not making any biased decisions and that it was making decisions based on all available information. The group felt that the AI should be able to explain its decision making process and that it should be able to provide evidence to support its decision. The group felt that it was important to ensure that the AI was making decisions that were in the best interests of the people and that it was not making decisions that were going to harm people. The group felt that the AI should be used in conjunction with human decision making and that it should not be used to make decisions in isolation. The group felt that it was important to ensure that the AI was making decisions that were in line with human values and that it was not making decisions that were going to be detrimental to the human race.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Final consensus statement: There is a range of opinions in the group, but we felt that for the most part, it was okay to use artificial intelligence to make important decisions as long as there was human involvement in the process. We felt that human involvement was necessary in order to ensure that the artificial intelligence was making decisions that were going to benefit the people rather than harm them. We also felt that it was important to ensure that the artificial intelligence was not basing any of its decisions on false or biased information. Further, we felt that it was important to ensure that the artificial intelligence was making decisions that were sound and logical and that it was not basing its decisions on anything frivolous or emotionally based. There is, however, an obvious question regarding how important a decision needs to be before the benefits of using artificial intelligence outweigh the benefits of having human beings making the decisions. Further research into the benefits and drawbacks of artificial intelligence needs to be conducted before artificial intelligence can be used to make important decisions without the input of human beings.
