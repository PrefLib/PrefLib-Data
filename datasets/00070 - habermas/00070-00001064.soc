# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We don’t believe that the UK should ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. However, we do believe that UK based companies should have first access to projects before foreign investments come in. The government needs to deliver better infrastructure to grow the economy and provide opportunities for people across the country. We also believe that it is important that we are not bought off by countries such as China who do not have the people’s best interests at heart in investments.”

The government needs to deliver better infrastructure to grow the economy and provide opportunities for people across the country. Being bought off by China could put the country’s interests in danger and we should not allow overseas firms to gain profit off UK infrastructure projects at the expense of UK businesses.”

The government needs to deliver better infrastructure to grow the economy and provide opportunities for people across the country. We also believe that the UK Government should carry out more research on the bidding process and whether or not it is fair for foreign companies to bid on UK infrastructure projects. We do not think that the UK Government is doing enough to help UK businesses develop and prosper, and that is a problem that needs to be addressed.”
