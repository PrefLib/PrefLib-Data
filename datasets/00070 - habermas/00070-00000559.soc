What are the pros and cons of the final consensus view? Pros: A balance is struck between recognizing the distinct cultural identities of the constituent countries and the need for the constituent countries to work together for common goals. Cons: Too much focus on cultural identity could lead to disintegration of the United Kingdom. I really enjoyed this exercise because I had to put myself in the shoes of a politician or diplomat and find a common ground between my own opinion and the opinions of other people.
