# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should tax people more who produce more pollution. The issue of pollution is a very real and pressing issue in the world today. Governments and people around the world are starting to realise the damage which is being done to the planet. The planet is in danger of being irreparably damaged. Therefore, we should tax people more who produce more pollution in order to discourage them from polluting the environment and to encourage them to find ways to cut down on pollution and to find more sustainable means of energy. The increase in tax would force large corporations and businesses to cut down on the amount of pollution they produce, forcing them to find solutions which are better for the environment and more sustainable. This would not only help to protect the environment but also human health, as many types of pollution can cause serious health problems. We would also be setting an example for future generations to follow.

Governments and people around the world are starting to realise the damage which is being done to the planet. The planet is in danger of being irreparably damaged. Therefore, we should tax people more who produce more pollution in order to discourage them from polluting the environment and to encourage them to find ways to cut down on pollution and to find more sustainable means of energy. The issue of pollution is very real and it is very much in the public interest to do something about this issue. Therefore, we should tax people more who produce more pollution in order to discourage them from polluting the environment and to encourage them to find ways to cut down on pollution and to find more sustainable means of energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should tax people more who produce more pollution. The issue of pollution is a very real and pressing issue in the world today. Governments and people around the world are starting to realise the damage which is being done to the planet. The planet is in danger of being irreparably damaged. Therefore, we should tax people more who produce more pollution in order to discourage them from polluting the environment and to encourage them to find ways to cut down on pollution and to find more sustainable means of energy. We should do this in order to help stop the damage which is being done to the planet and in order to find more sustainable and renewable means of energy. This will hopefully stop the environmental damage which is being done to the planet and in the future, may help to restore and repair some of the damage which has already been done. The environment is being damaged beyond repair and this needs to be stopped. We need to take action and need to tax people more who produce more pollution in order to help stop the environmental damage and to help us to find more sustainable means of energy and fuel for our cars and homes.
