# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Selling organs is wrong for two main reasons. Firstly, there is the risk of disease. The people buying the organs are doing so to make themselves better and healthier. If the organs are bought from a donor who is sick, then the patient is going to suffer as a result. Secondly, if selling organs is allowed, then people will be taking advantage of those in poverty. If we allow it, then a system will be created whereby the rich can get better at the expense of the poor. It is exploitative and should not be allowed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Organ sales would devalue human life by allowing organs to be bought and sold like commodities. This may lead to many people in poorer countries being exploited by the rich and powerful.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is wrong to sell organs for transplant. It goes against all medical ethics. There are major health risks of passing on diseases. There is the potential for exploitation of people in desperate situations. Donating organs is a charitable act and should be maintained as such.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the selling of organs for transplant. There were some in the group that said that there were rare cases where it might be justified, but only where there was an adequate monitoring system in place. The consensus opinion of the group is that there is something special about the human body and it is not something that should be commercialised.
