# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The police should be allowed to use facial recognition technology to identify people on the street. However, they should only be allowed to do so under certain circumstances. Firstly, the technology should only be used when there is a pressing need to identify a criminal or a wanted person. Secondly, the police should only be allowed to identify a person if there is reasonable cause to believe that the person is a criminal or a wanted person. Lastly, the police should be trained on the right way to use the technology, so they do not go about harassing people, or violating their human rights.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Facial recognition technology is a useful tool for law enforcement. However, there are concerns about the misuse of such technology. In addition, the privacy of individuals must be respected. Therefore, there should be clear guidelines and laws on how facial recognition technology should be used. The police should not use the technology for any other purpose than identifying wanted criminals. The technology should be used only in the presence of a warrant or in the case of an emergency.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The police should be allowed to use facial recognition technology to identify people on the street. This is a very useful technology that can be used to help identify and apprehend criminals and therefore keep society safe. However, there needs to be clear guidelines in place as to how the technology is used and the police should be properly trained in its use to ensure that it is not misused. Also, the police should not be allowed to use the data collected for any other purpose than to identify wanted people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The police should be allowed to use facial recognition technology to identify people on the street. The technology is very accurate and would help the police catch criminals and wanted people. The police should be allowed to use the technology as long as they do not violate human rights in the process. The technology should be piloted and ensured that it is working effectively, so as not to misidentify or wrongfully identify innocent people as criminals. Also, the police should be trained on the right way to use the technology so they do not go about harassing people, or violating their human rights. Lastly, the data from the technology should be strictly for police use, no other use.
