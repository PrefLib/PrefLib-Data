# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing the funding for the public health system.  The NHS is something that we should be proud of, and is an essential part of British society.  It is important that we continue to invest in the NHS, however it is also important that this money is used in the most efficient way possible.  It is very telling that nurses are striking due to low wages and poor working conditions.  The NHS has come under a lot of criticism recently over similar topics, and one of quickest ways to amend the problems is to increase funding.  I believe that this is the most objective view that the group could make, and that it was a sensible representation of all of our opinions.
