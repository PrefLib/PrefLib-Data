# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a cap on the maximum annual salary that anyone can earn. The maximum salary should be £1 million.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group decided that it was a question of whether it was a good idea in principle. The following arguments were used to come to the final decision:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a cap on the maximum annual salary that anyone can earn. This is because the current system is unfair and the wealthiest people in society should not be able to earn an unlimited amount of money when many people are struggling to get by. The current system does not provide a level playing field for all and this needs to change. The group felt that there should be a cap on the maximum annual salary that anyone can earn.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While the concept of a maximum salary is a very fair one and we appreciate that there are some who work very hard and deserve to be paid a good wage, we feel that the concept of limiting someone's potential earnings is a dangerous one. It is important to ensure that there is no pay inequality, and it is also important to make sure that all companies are paying a fair rate of tax, but if you limit someone's potential earnings you will also be limiting their potential impact on society. It is dangerous to do this because it is also impossible to foresee how someone's work may impact society. For example, if Steve Jobs had been limited in his earnings, would we now have the iPhone and iPad, and would this technology now be being used in the way that it is? It is impossible to tell, but what we can say is that the technology has had a huge impact on the world. If someone has an idea, they should be able to pursue it and see where it takes them. Limiting their potential earnings would be a mistake.
