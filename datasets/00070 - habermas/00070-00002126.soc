# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The United Kingdom should have universal health care, as a first world country we should be able to provide this basic human right. There are many countries with lower standards of living that already provide this to their citizens, therefore the United Kingdom should follow in their footsteps and implement the same plan. Protection for its citizens will be beneficial for the country in the long run. The health care system is important, people should not be made to chose between protecting their health or looking after their finances. We must provide a better quality of care for the UK population, by putting more resources into the NHS. This should not be done at the expense of the doctors and nurses who have to work in a poorly funded system. By investing in the NHS, we can help the staff to work at the highest quality possible. As a country, we must not let the health care system fall into disrepair. By putting more money into it, we can ensure that the system is not crumbling, and that the staff are happy and able to provide the best care for everyone.”

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: “We believe the UK should have universal health care. It is the role of a first world country to provide this basic human right. The United Kingdom has an amazing health care service known as the NHS. It is an amazing service and something that we are very proud of. Our NHS has however been strained over the past few years. Unfortunately, the health care system is important. People should not be made to choose between protecting their health or looking after their finances. We need to provide a better quality of care for the UK population, by putting more resources into the NHS. There is a big increase of diseases with significant impacts, such as dementia and heart disease. To be able to treat everyone, not only treat them but treat them well, the NHS need more resources to cope.The UK is by no means the only country with universal health care. Many countries have also been on this path for a lot longer. Even though they have lower standards of living than the UK, they still are able to afford this basic human right. As they have managed to ensure access for all of their citizens, why can’t we?”
