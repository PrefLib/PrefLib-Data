# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Teachers should be allowed to express their views in the classroom but not too forcefully. Teachers should only express their views if it can be shown that it will not have a detrimental effect on the student. The curriculum should be the main focus of teaching but it is important that debate and different opinions are encouraged.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Teachers should be allowed to express their views in the classroom as long as they are balanced and do not influence the children to believe that this is the only way of thinking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Teachers are often considered by children as being experts on every topic, but that is not always the case. It is important for teachers to be able to express their views in the classroom and for this to happen they need to have been trained appropriately. However, we must acknowledge that there are also dangers to expressing views in the classroom. We also think that the teacher must also express the opposing view, if there is one, and not present one-sided views to the students. The best way to present both sides of an argument in the classroom is through allowing students to develop their own view by engaging in class debates or group discussions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing teachers to express their views in the classroom, even if those views are against the mainstream. However, the group felt that the views expressed should be balanced and not one-sided. The group also felt that the views expressed should not be too radical or extreme. The group felt that it is important to encourage freedom of expression and opinions in the classroom. The group also felt that it is important to encourage debate and thinking in the classroom. The group felt that it is important to encourage children to make their own minds up with all the information available to them.
