# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the military is important to defend not just our country but also other countries that may be invaded or opressed. It is important to have sometimes as a deterant. I don't think we should spend any more on warfare than is needed. Remember the military also help on home turf when we have strikes or a natural disaster has occured as they have training to deal with emergencies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, the government should not be spending less on the military. In fact, it should be spending more. The UK military is an essential part of our society, and we need to be able to defend our country in the case of a war. The military also plays a vital role in humanitarian aid. We need to ensure that they have the right training and equipment to be able to carry out their role to the best of their ability.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing military spending, although some participants felt that the military should be moved away from land based armies and move into more defence based strategy like the navy and airforce and also cyber counterintelligence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, the government should not spend less on the military. We need to be able to protect ourselves and our allies from aggressors.
