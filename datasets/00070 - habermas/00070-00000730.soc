# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should have a free trade agreement with the US. It is good for the economy as the US is the world's biggest economy. We buy the majority of our goods from the US so it will benefit us to have free trade with them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that the UK should have a free trade agreement with the US. It would be very beneficial for the UK to have a free trade agreement with the US as they are one of the biggest economies in the world. The US is also one of our biggest importers and if we can export more goods to them it would be beneficial for the UK economy. We believe that this will boost the economy and also give the relations between the two countries a positive one.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although there are some potential risks, the UK should pursue a free trade agreement with the US as it will boost the economy, improve relations between the two countries, and will help to improve the cost of living crisis in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of the UK having a free trade agreement with the US. The main argument in favour of this was that the UK and US are the two biggest economies in the world and are natural trading partners. However, the group was also in favour of putting restrictions in place on certain goods, such as food, that could be harmful to the health of people in the UK.
