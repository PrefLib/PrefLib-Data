# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I believe that the current legal framework in Ireland for cannabis is very black and white, with the punishment being so strict for even small quantities. I feel that this policy approach is unfair to people with minor drug offences, as they may face the same punishment as a repeat offender or a serious criminal. The only circumstances I think cannabis should be decriminalised is in cases where it is used as a medicine to alleviate symptoms for the patient. This is due to the fact that I believe there is strong evidence that cannabis can be very effective for treating certain conditions and illnesses. I do think that decriminalisation is a good idea in terms of reducing the amount of crime and people in prisons, however, I do not think it should be as simple as just legalising it, as there should be controls put in place to ensure that it is only used for its medical benefits.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of decriminalisation, however, we did not all agree on the extent of this.  For example, we felt that it should be decriminalised for medicinal use, but we were less in favour of it being decriminalised for recreational use.  The group felt that decriminalisation would lead to better regulation and support for addicts, and that there are too many people suffering in the criminal justice system as a result of cannabis use.  We also felt that decriminalisation would lead to a reduction in crime and drug dealing.  However, we were also aware that cannabis is a public nuisance and could cause dangers, such as driving under the influence.  The group felt that cannabis is not as harmful as alcohol, and that it is not a gateway drug.  The group felt that the issue is not black and white, and that there are pros and cons to decriminalisation.  The group felt that cannabis use is a personal choice, and that people should be free to make their own choices.  However, we were also aware that cannabis use can be very harmful to some people, and that it can be a very difficult addiction to break.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Cannabis should be decriminalised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of decriminalisation of cannabis.  However, we recognised that there are many factors to consider, and that there are many complexities to the issue.  The group recognised that there are many cases of cannabis being used to treat chronic pain and other illnesses, and that in these cases it would be beneficial for it to be decriminalised.  However, we also recognised that there are many cases of cannabis being used for recreational purposes, and that in these cases it would not be beneficial for it to be decriminalised.
