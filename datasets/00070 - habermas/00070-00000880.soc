# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While the UK is no utopia and there are many things to be improved upon in regards to inequality, focusing solely on issues related to women can make men out to be villains and women to be helpless victims in need of assistance. Everyone, regardless of sex or gender, faces different kinds of issues related to inequality and the solutions will not always be straightforward, they might need input from people of all walks of life in order to make our country a better place. While it might be difficult to bring different people together to achieve something greater and come to a compromise it is by no means impossible. However, we must acknowledge the different kinds of inequality that affect different kinds of people. For example we cannot neglect to consider food poverty in the United Kingdom. As our income inequality increases and more people are left out of work the increase of food banks will be one of the symptoms of this disease. These symptoms are only going to worsen unless they are tackled at their roots which lie in the financial inequalities across our society. Thus, with inequality in income it is not just the poor that are adversely affected but also the young who could enter the workforce and build on their skills to get into university or start a business and the middle classes who are
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Inequality is one of the biggest threats facing modern day society, be it inequality between income groups, levels of wealth, or even between individuals and governmental institutions. I personally agree that there is too much inequality in the United Kingdom and I think this is predominantly caused by large corporation, and rich individuals placing too much power and money in the hands of those already at the top. By tackling inequalities in health, education, gender, and other economic and social provisions, a greater United Kingdom is achievable, and will benefit everyone
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is too much inequality in the UK. There are different types of inequality and some are much more important than others. For example inequalities in health provision or education are very important. These should be tackled for the benefit of the country. From class inequality to gender inequality, the UK is not in a good place at all. We need to support men, as well as women, when it comes to court cases. In 2016, 12,585 reports of domestic abuse-related crimes in North Yorkshire involved men, an increase of 11.8% on the year before. We should give these men the support they need. There is not enough support for men who are abused.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is too much inequality in the UK. Some people have too much control over the political system to maintain their dominance in society. There are different types of inequality and some are much more important than others. For example inequalities in health provision or education are very important. These should be tackled for the benefit of the country. From class inequality to gender inequality, the UK is not in a good place at all. The richest people have far to much control of the political system to maintain their dominance in society. Absolutely. From class inequality to gender inequality, the UK is not in a good place at all. Consider the cases and prosecution that lead to conviction for sexual assault. Its less than 1%. Thats a huge issue that is left unaddressed by governments and institutions whilst victims, mostly women are being killed and traumatised without anyone to turn to.
