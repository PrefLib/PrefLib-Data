# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I feel neutral about this topic. I don't think I necessarily know what is in our current constitution; and, the UK as a whole doesn't necessarily have a constitution but rather a set of laws, rules and regulations which are constantly evolving anyway, so constantly being rewritten. If this is proposing a differing country, then I have no reason to agree or disagree.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Considering societal evolution and the changing needs of our nation, a thoughtful reexamination of the current constitution may be beneficial. Amendments and updates can ensure it remains relevant, protecting citizens' rights, and addressing contemporary challenges while preserving the core values upon which it was built.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes I think so. A constitution should be under constant review and alteration to better reflect the current state of society and all and any technological and social advancements. Some fundamentals will almost certainly never change, but keeping up to date is important to be relevant.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I think the constitution although is dated in some areas still reflects peoples rights. It is important to keep updating and modernising as some parts will become obsolete and outdated. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I feel that overall the constitution, that is to say the laws of the land, is okay and more or less fit for purpose.  However, it is riddled with obscure and outdated laws which do not reflect the modern times in some ways.  These could do with fixing and will help bring the UK into a more modern time.
