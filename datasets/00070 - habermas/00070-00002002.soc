The only time people should own guns is for the purposes of self defence, and that too only when absolutely necessary. Conclusions Having seen the research method in action myself, I believe that facilitated research can be a very powerful tool in conducting research on problems which are hard to pin down.

In general, the UK is a safe place to live, and this is in part due to the strict gun laws that are in place. However, there are still some areas in the UK where gun crime is prevalent. This is most likely down to illegal gun ownership rather than legal ownership, but the laws on legal gun ownership should be made more stringent and should be made even more difficult to obtain a licence.
