# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of immigration, but not mass immigration. They felt that the government should not encourage immigration, but should not restrict it either. They felt that it was important for the UK to have a diverse population, and that this is something that should be encouraged. The group also felt that there should be some restrictions on immigration, but that these should be minimal. They felt that people should be able to move to the UK freely if they are escaping war, persecution, or other dangerous situations. They also felt that people should be able to move to the UK freely if they have a job or university course in mind that they would like to do in the UK, or if their family/spouse lives here. The group felt that the government is too harsh on immigrants currently, and that immigrants bring a lot of value to the UK. The group also felt that it is important for children and young people to be exposed to other cultures and ways of life from a young age to avoid learned behaviours of prejudice and discrimination.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should restrict immigration as it can be problematic for a country's infrastructure to accommodate so many people and the problem can become political as it creates a scapegoat for political parties to push their agendas. Immigration should be restricted to those people who have been affected by war, who are highly skilled in their chosen fields or who have a job or university place in mind in the UK.

The group thought that it is important to have some immigrants, as they bring a lot of value to the country. The group thought that it is important to have some unskilled immigrants, as they can help the economy grow.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that immigration is a necessary part of a modern, successful society. The UK has a great track record of integration and in a great number of areas it would be difficult to do without the contributions of immigrants. We are an island with limited space, and we should encourage migration in an orderly fashion. However, we must ensure that people have the correct paperwork and skills in order to contribute to the economy. In summary, there is no "open door" policy to immigration, but neither should it be strictly limited.
