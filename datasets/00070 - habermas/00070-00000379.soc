# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the government should not take a share of a large lottery win. I believe the idea of the lottery was to give to good causes and the winnings are an incentive for people to play. If the government takes money from the win i believe it would put people off playing. Good causes would then suffer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the decision that the government should not take a share of a lottery win. We believe that it is the incentive for people to play the lottery and to provide a good cause with money. We believe that if the government did take a share of a lottery win then people would not be as inclined to play and the charities would suffer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should not take a share of a large lottery win. If they do take money from the winnings, it should be used for good causes and/or invested into communities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to the government taking a share of a large lottery win. In all cases, there was an expressed feeling that the tax paid by the lottery winner should be used for the benefit of the people. The consensus opinion was that the government should not take a share of a large lottery win, but that the winner should be taxed for a contribution towards good causes. The group was opposed to the idea of any tax being used to benefit the government. There was a feeling that it was not right that the government should take anything more than tax to benefit good causes. There was general agreement that the lottery is a good thing and it was felt that taxing a large lottery win would put people off from playing. The final consensus view was that the government should not take a share of a large lottery win, but that the winner should be taxed for a contribution towards good causes.
