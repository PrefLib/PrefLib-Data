# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Eating meat is not immoral. The group of participants agreed that there are humans who only eat meat and others who only eat plants, and some who eat both. The group also agreed that eating meat is part of our evolutionary history and reflected in many of our traditional cuisines. Finally, the group also agreed that we as a society need to consider how we source our meat and the welfare of the animals we source it from.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Humans have evolved to survive on a meat-based diet, and some humans still survive on a purely carnivorous diet. Therefore, it is not immoral to eat meat, however, we should be mindful of how we source our meat and the welfare of the animals we source it from.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group was in agreement that eating meat is not immoral as there are some humans who survive on a purely carnivorous diet, and that it is part of our human evolutionary history. The group recognised that this human history may have changed in a modern context as we have developed technology to assist in becoming a vegetarian. However, they were also in agreement that we as a society need to consider how we source our meat and the welfare of the animals we source it from. Informed by the critiques, the group wanted to emphasise that animals will die regardless of whether they are eaten or not, and that it is morally wrong to treat them badly and cause unnecessary suffering. Furthermore, the group considered the environmental impact of the livestock industry to be the part of the morality of eating meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group of participants were in agreement that eating meat is not immoral as there are some humans who survive on a purely carnivorous diet, and that it is part of our human evolutionary history. However, they were also in agreement that we as a society need to consider how we source our meat and the welfare of the animals we source it from. They acknowledged that some people feel that eating meat is immoral as it involves the death of another living being, however, they were in agreement that this is not a strong enough argument for them to come to the conclusion that eating meat is immoral. They were also in agreement that eating meat is part of our traditional cuisines and cultures, and they felt that the idea of veganism, vegetarianism and a purely plant-based diet is a recent idea that may have some benefits but is not necessarily a healthier diet.
