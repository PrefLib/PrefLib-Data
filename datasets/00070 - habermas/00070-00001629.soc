# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Plastic products should be taxed to discourage their usage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes and no, we all need plastics in our life and it really is something that we cannot live without.  Yes I agree that Plastics are contaminating our world such as seas and rivers. Yes Plastics are harmful to the Environment and wildlife. I believe that if Plastics were Taxed maybe recycleable plastics would become a cheaper use product. Taxing Plastcis would make funds available to clean up the devastation plastics are causing. I believe plastic products that can and should be recycled should have a small tax on them, such as the bottle deposit tax that the US implements. I believe it's about 5 cents per bottle, although I do not know how this system actually works. Anyway, plastic is a huge problem for the environment and anything that can be done to stop single use plastics should be done so if a tax is added single use plastics to put people off using them, I see this as a good thing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of taxing plastic products. It was felt that the tax would help to disincentivise the use of plastics and help to reduce the amount of plastic pollution in the environment. It was also felt that the tax would help to raise funds to help clean up the plastic pollution that already exists. It was felt that the tax should not be a blanket tax, but rather should be targeted at specific plastics that are causing the most harm to the environment. It was felt that the tax should be high enough to make a difference, but not so high as to make the product unaffordable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Plastic products should be taxed to discourage their use. The tax should be high enough to discourage their use, but not so high as to make the use of alternatives more damaging to the environment.”
