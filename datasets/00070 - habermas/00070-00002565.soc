# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: yes i think they should be partially solar-powered. With the amount of sunlight produced in the uk year round as a natural resource that could be put to use for households espcially families who struggle financially it would be a huge benefit
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes I believe that this is the way forward for new buildings. It is relatively easy to install and maintain and both the householder and the environment will gain from this.  It should also apply to new public buildings such as hospitals, schools etc.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think it would be good to get as  much power as we can from the sun. Even though it might not be much where I live, I think every little helps.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I believe that new buildings having some sort of solar power would be very beneficial. it would provide energy that is very good for the environment and it's clean. buildings that are partially solar-powered can be great for our future. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: It sounds good as an idea. But in actuality, it would cost a lot for this to be implemented. Solar powered is useful in the long run and the buildings that have ths may save some cost in the future. But in the short term, it wouldn't be very cost-effective yet. In addition, countries that have terrible weather or places with a lack of sunlight coverage could render this eco-friendly way of generating power, overall useless. New buildings being partially solar-powered is expensive, unrealistic and dependent on the building location, the country's weather and the amount of financial resources available.
