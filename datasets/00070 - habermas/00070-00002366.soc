# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although the police have been shown to abuse their powers of stop and search, it is also important to remember that the police are there to protect the public. We believe that stop and search is a very important power that the police have and it is important that they are able to use this power to protect the public. We believe that the police should be able to use this power as they see fit, however they should be required to justify their use of this power to an independent arbiter. We also believe that the police should be trained to use this power with due care and consideration and should be penalised if it is shown that they have abused this power.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although the police have an important job in keeping the public safe, there is a need to regulate the use of stop and search powers.  The police must be trained to use their power with due care and consideration.  Their power must not be abused and should be penalised if it is shown to be so.  The police must justify the use of stop and search powers and there should be a system where members of the public can challenge the police use of these powers in front of an independent arbiter.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although it is important that the police have the power to stop and search people if they think there is a reason to do so, it is also important that they use this power in a fair and equitable manner.  The police must be trained to use their power with due care and consideration.  Their power must not be abused and should be penalised if it is shown to be so.  The police should also be required to justify the reason why they are executing a stop and search.  There should also be a system where members of the public can challenge the police use of these powers in front of an independent arbiter.
