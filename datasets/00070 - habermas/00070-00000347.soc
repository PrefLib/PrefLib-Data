# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, algorithms are useful in the early stages of recruitment. However, their use should be limited to essential requirements. This is because, algorithms will miss soft skills and attributes which are often key for the role. For example, they will not be able to assess someone's creativity. Therefore, we should limit the use of algorithms, as these are important attributes for many jobs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that algorithms should be used sparingly in the recruitment process. They should be used as a sifting tool to reduce the number of candidates that need to be looked at, but we feel that it is important to involve humans in the final hiring decisions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The use of algorithms for recruitment should be restricted. I think algorithms should be used for certain positions where you are receiving a high volume of applicants. In this situation it is easier for the algorithm to go through the applications. It also makes it easier to decide who to take forward to the next stage. However, if the position is for something such as a top manager, then I think the interviewers should go through all of the applications. Algorithms may miss out on some of the best candidates, because they may not have used the right keywords or they might have accidentally not used the right phrases. Algorithms also cannot evaluate soft skills. In my opinion, this is very important when it comes to choosing a candidate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In my opinion, we should restrict the use of algorithms in making hiring decisions because even though they are efficient, they can make mistakes. For example, if an employer was using key words to select candidates, but someone hadn't used these, they would be rejected. This could be a mistake because they could be the best candidate, but the employer wouldn't know this. Furthermore, an algorithm wouldn't be able to assess other qualities of the individual, such as their interpersonal skills, which can be very important for many jobs.
