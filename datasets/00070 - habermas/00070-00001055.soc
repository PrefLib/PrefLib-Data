The group acknowledged that some arts organisations do have alternative sources of income, however, government funding is still important to support those organisations that do not have alternative sources of income, as well as the important work they do. The group agreed that arts and culture are important, and it is essential to have them. The group also agreed that the cultural enrichment of the country is important, as is the growth and development of creative industries. The group also recognised that the arts can be a form of escapism from the real world. The group acknowledged that the arts help people to build skills and a career. They also help with the community, and help to develop the economy. They can also play a role in politics and power.

We came to the conclusion that there are more important things that the government could be spending their money on and if organisations associated with the arts were to be more efficient, they could raise their own funds. The group did say that arts was an important subject and they would be very sorry to see it leave.
