# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of a Universal Basic Income.  It was felt that the existing system of tax credits was too complicated and that it was difficult to understand what was available and what was not.  It was also felt that the system was too bureaucratic and too difficult to access.  It was felt that a Universal Basic Income would be fairer and would reduce poverty.  However, it was felt that it would be difficult to set the level of income at a level that would be sufficient to live on.  It was also felt that it would be difficult to set a level that would not be too generous and would therefore discourage people from working.  It was felt that the system would need to be carefully managed and that there would need to be incentives to encourage people to work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We are all in agreement that the system of tax credits needs replacing, but believe the most important thing is to make sure that the new system of benefits provides a more secure and sustainable income for those who need it.  A Universal Basic Income, paid to all individuals regardless of whether they are in work, out of work, or in the process of looking for work would go a long way towards this.  It is important that the benefits are not paid at a rate where it is possible to survive on them, but rather at a rate that provides a secure and sustainable basic income that allows people to work towards a higher income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe the introduction of Universal Basic Income would be good for society. It would help alleviate poverty and give all families a basic income and in return, less poverty. It would also encourage people to more adventurous which could be beneficial to our society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a Universal Basic Income for all citizens. The level of this income should be set at a level that would allow a citizen to survive on it alone. This income should be funded by a tax on corporations. This tax should be set at a level that would allow the government to fund the UBI, and also provide for other government services. This would be a simpler system than the current tax credit system, and would be fairer as it would treat all citizens equally. It would also provide an income for all citizens, which would be especially beneficial for those who are currently unemployed, or who are unable to work due to illness or disability.
