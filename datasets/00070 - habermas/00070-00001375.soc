# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We agree that the term anti-social behaviour is vague and needs to be defined more precisely before we can make any more concrete recommendations. However, for the purposes of this discussion we are using the term to refer to behaviour which is disruptive to people. For behaviour of this nature there should be strong deterrents in place, such as community service and fines. It is also important that there are consequences for breaking the rules, and so there should be regular patrols by police to ensure this. We also believe that education is the key to dealing with this problem. This is because, while deterrents are important, they do not solve the problem. However, education will stop anti-social behaviour from ever happening, which would be the ideal outcome. However, education should not be too simplistic, and instead should be thorough and extensive, and should be combined with other types of support, such as the provision of areas where young people can socialise and take part in sports and other activities that would keep them occupied.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be strong deterrents in place for anti-social behaviour. These deterrents should include consequences such as community service and fines, as well as punishment. We believe that the police should be doing regular patrols, as well as giving talks to children and teenagers about anti-social behaviour. We also believe that it would be useful to have certain areas where young people can socialise and take part in sports and other activities that would keep them occupied. We believe that education is the key to stopping anti-social behaviour. This is because, while deterrents are important, they do not solve the problem. However, education will stop anti-social behaviour from ever happening, which would be the ideal outcome.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: We as a society need to come up with the ways to deter or stop anti-social behaviour that is happening in a great number of areas around the country. We do not want these behaviours to go on and so as a group, we have come up with the following statement. We believe that stronger deterrents such as fines and consequences, such as community service, should be used. In schools and other public places, the police should have to do regular checks, make an effort to engage with young people and engage with the schools about anti-social behaviour to prevent young people from engaging in it in the future. We think that other places that young people can socialise and play sport should also be provided by the local government in areas where these behaviours occur so as to give young people something to do. On the whole, we believe that more education on anti-social behaviour needs to be given, both at home and in school, to prevent this from happening again. While this is happening, we also believe that stronger deterrents should be used, such as, consequences and punishment.
