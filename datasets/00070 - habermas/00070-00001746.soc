# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the current system of encouraging national pride in the UK is not working and needs to be rethought. There needs to be a greater emphasis on what makes the UK great and what is good about being British. This will require a change in the education system to ensure that the next generation is more aware of the history of the UK and the great things it has achieved. There also needs to be a greater emphasis on the achievements of the UK in the media and by the government. This will help to create a greater sense of national pride.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - National pride is important for social cohesion and it is something that should be promoted more by our society and education system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - National pride is a very emotive issue which often inspires debate. We believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions and we do not want to appear to be passing judgement on anyone’s beliefs. As a group, we believe that a person’s national pride should come from within. Government efforts to encourage national pride can lead to nationalistic sentiment which can be used for ulterior motives. On the other hand, the breakdown of national pride has led to the emergence of nationalistic movements which do not appear to be interested in peaceful resolution of issues. This has led to unnecessary bloodshed. We do not feel that the role of the government is to enforce a particular sentiment on its citizens but to provide an environment that allows everyone to express their views freely and peacefully.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of encouraging national pride, but recognised that some people would disagree with this.
