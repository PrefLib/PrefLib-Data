# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Diversity within a company is always beneficial, whether in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation or religious beliefs. If the demographics of a company's board of directors do not reflect the demographics of the company's average workforce, there is a greater risk that problems within the company may not be noticed, and that initiatives that could help the company may be overlooked. On the other hand, it is important to recognise that it is not necessary for the board of directors to be made up of people who look like the average workers, but rather of people who can bring their own unique and diverse perspectives to the table, and who have the expertise and knowledge necessary to do their job well.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although there are benefits in having a company's board of directors be representative of the company's average workforce, it is more important to have a board of directors that brings a variety of experiences and opinions to the table, and who can do their job well.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The benefits of diversity within a company, whether in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation or religious beliefs, have long been recognised. However, for diversity to be beneficial, it must be celebrated and cultivated, which requires a long-term commitment to it from the top of the company. A diverse workforce must also reflect the diversity of the communities and customers that the company serves, which means the demographics of the workforce must be allowed to shift and change over time. For a company's board of directors to have the same demographics as the company's average workforce is not necessary, and diversity should not be approached as a quota to fill. However, a diverse board is always beneficial, as it provides a larger pool of experience and opinions, and avoids systemic bias in the decision-making process, helping the company to make the best decisions for its customers and workers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Whilst it is true that a company's board of directors would usually be comprised of a similar group of people who have experience and expertise that can be of benefit to the company, it can also be of benefit to make sure that the demographics of the board of directors reflect those of the company's average workforce. Different demographic groups have different needs and desires, and if the board of directors is not diverse enough, it could be difficult to meet those needs and identify what all the issues are in a company.
