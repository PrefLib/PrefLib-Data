# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Given the current economic situation, the government should increase taxes, however this should be done in a fair way. A system should be put in place where tax payers get to choose where they want their money to go towards. Tax payers money should not be wasted and should be invested in schools, hospitals and public transport. It would also be a good idea to invest in more energy efficient buildings, so that the country can be more self sufficient and less dependent on importing energy. The increase in taxes shouldn't be too high so that the public can cope with the change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, the government should not increase taxes to reduce the deficit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although increasing taxes is a simple and effective way to reduce the deficit, it is not the only way. Increasing taxes can reduce the purchasing power of the public, resulting in a higher unemployment rate and a lower standard of living for most of the population. The Government could also look at increasing taxes on big businesses and corporations, as many of these avoid paying taxes due to legal loopholes. Increasing taxes on these businesses would still result in a reduction in the deficit, without affecting the purchasing power of the average person.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should increase taxes to reduce the deficit. However, taxes should not be increased on wages or small businesses. Instead, the government should increase taxes on large corporations who are already dodging their tax payments and using legal loopholes to avoid paying their fair share.
