# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the immigration system is already strict enough. However, there are areas that can be improved upon. The current system is heavily focused on documentation and paperwork, which can be very tedious and difficult to understand. There should be more focus on the social aspects of immigration, ensuring that people are being integrated into society. The system should also be more flexible, with the option of a temporary visa. This would allow people to come to the country for a certain period of time, to work or study, and then return to their home country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, we do not need an immigration system that is much stricter than the one we currently have. The current system is already very strict and dehumanising, and we believe that there are many ways in which the system could be made more efficient and more considerate of the people that it is supposed to be helping.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It was agreed that the system should be re-made but not made more strict. The system should have a period of transition so that everyone can adapt to the changes and the integration part of the process can be a success. The period of transition should last about 5 years after which the changes would come into full force. It was also agreed that a system that considers social issues and the reason for people's immigration needs to be made. The system should not be overly strict as to allow for people to have a say in the situation that they have to deal with.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although there are a number of factors to consider we believe that we do need an immigration system that is much stricter than the one we currently have. Our current immigration system is strict but there is still a lot of room for improvement. This is especially important in order to ensure that the safety and health of the people already living in the country is not compromised. As the issue of immigration has become more and more relevant in recent years, it is necessary that we introduce a more advanced and thorough immigration system in order to protect those living in the country.
