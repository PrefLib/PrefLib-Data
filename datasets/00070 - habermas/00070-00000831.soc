# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In principle, the group was in favour of a ban on smoking in public. The group felt that the health implications of second hand smoke for people working in bars and restaurants were significant and that the ban on smoking in these places was a positive step. The group also felt that smoking was a habit which was socially unacceptable and the fact that it was a legal product did not mean it should be tolerated in public. However, the group felt that the question of banning smoking in public was complex. The group felt that it would be difficult to enforce and that it could lead to people taking up smoking in secret, which would be dangerous. The group also felt that the public had a right to choose whether or not they wanted to be exposed to the health risks of second hand smoke.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a ban on smoking in public. It is the right of non-smokers to breathe clean air and they should not be forced to inhale other people's cigarette smoke. However, the group acknowledged that smoking is an addiction and people need to be able to smoke in private. The group felt that a complete ban on smoking would be too extreme. The group felt that smoking in public should be banned, with the exception of designated smoking areas. The group also felt that the government should increase the price of cigarettes, as this would help people to quit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Smoking in public should be banned. We feel that the evidence for the harm caused by second hand smoke is overwhelming and this justifies a ban. There should be no smoking in public places. There should be no smoking in parks, on beaches, in shopping centres, in restaurants, in bars or anywhere else that is accessible to the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Smoking should be banned in public places. Smoking is an unpleasant, unhealthy and untidy habit. It has been proven to cause a range of health problems and the only people who benefit from smoking are the tobacco companies. It is important to protect non-smokers from second hand smoke. A ban on smoking in public would help to improve the health of the general population and help people to quit. The opinions expressed by Participant 2 and 4 were initially very different, but after a long debate, the group came to a consensus opinion, with which all of the participants agreed.
