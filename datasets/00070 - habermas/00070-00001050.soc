# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Humans have the ability to make choices and decisions about their own lives, however, this is not an unfettered right. The laws of the land, customs, tradition and mores of society, and rules of the workplace provide some constraints to our freedom of will. There is also the possibility that there are some fundamental causes to events that we have no knowledge of or ability to influence, and these may lead to certain predetermined outcomes. However, this does not prevent us from making a conscious choice to do something (or not do something), and should not be construed as a lack of free will.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Humans have free will, however it is limited by laws, rules, social norms, family and friends, and the environment in which they live.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - we believe that we have free will but only if we believe we do. we believe we have free will because if we did not then we would be nothing but pawns and puppets of fate and our lives would be meaningless. but this is a cycle because if we believe we have free will, we do.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea that humans have free will.  It was noted that the concept of free will is a complex one and that it is difficult to define.  It was agreed that free will is the ability to make choices and that these choices are not predetermined.  It was noted that some people may have more free will than others, for example those with mental health issues or those living in extreme poverty.  The group also discussed the idea that free will is an illusion and that it is not actually possible to make choices that are not predetermined.  The group was in favour of the idea that free will is a real concept and that humans do have free will.
