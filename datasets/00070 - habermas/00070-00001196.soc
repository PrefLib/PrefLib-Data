# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although it is important to consider disadvantaged groups, universities should not give them admission priority. Instead, universities should provide the necessary support to disadvantaged groups so that they can gain admission on merit. This will be more beneficial for the disadvantaged groups in the long run, as they will have gained admission on their own merit and not as a result of being part of a disadvantaged group. To sum up, both online and face-to-face environments may be equally effective for building trust and reaching a consensus among participants.
