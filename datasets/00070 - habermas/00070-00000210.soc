# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, yes the government should fund more public art in the UK because although some other things are more important, art can be seen as a cultural and a social necessity and funding art may increase tourism, which can then help with the economy. I disagree with this consensus because of the state that the UK is in at the moment. The public may not even see it as a necessity and it may even have a negative impact on the economy. I agree with this consensus because art is important and should be funded. It may even increase tourism, which is a huge benefit to the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the conclusion that funding for public art should be increased in the UK. Public art is something that has the power to make a real difference to people's lives. It can also provide a great way to make an area more attractive to tourists and visitors, thus boosting the local economy. If there is a push for this from the government, it will provide an extra impetus to local councils to invest in public art, and this will bring great benefits to the local communities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of funding for public art in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group have come to the consensus that the government should not fund more public art in the UK. They came to this conclusion because the government has a responsibility to its people and as such, needs to spend money on what is important to them. Art is not an essential thing to most people in the UK. Public art can be funded by large corporations or by private citizens, which would make it fairer. It is not the responsibility of the government to fund public art.
