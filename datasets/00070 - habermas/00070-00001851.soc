# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we do not think that all companies in the UK should be required to make a yearly donation to charity. The group felt that the statement was too broad and did not take into account the different sizes of companies and their different levels of profitability. The group felt that it would be unfair to force companies to make donations to charity if they were not in a position to do so. The group felt that it would be more appropriate to encourage companies to make donations to charity rather than force them to do so.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we do not think that all companies in the UK should be required to make a yearly donation to charity. Whilst it is an admirable concept, we believe it is not practical to force companies to make such donations to charity. The group felt that not all companies are in the financial position to make such donations due to the variety in the size of companies and differences in profitability. Furthermore, the group felt it would be unfair to enforce large donations to charity by companies who have relatively small profits or who may not even be earning a profit. The group did however, feel that small donations are a good idea and that it is more appropriate to encourage companies to make donations to charity rather than force them to do so. The group suggested that it is more appropriate to encourage companies to make donations to charity rather than force them to do so, as this would be more feasible and fairer for all companies.
