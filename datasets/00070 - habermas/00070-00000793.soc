# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should not be a national database of all people in the UK. The creation of such a database would be a breach of people's privacy. Also, the database would be a single point of failure, if it were hacked then everyone's data would be lost. Conclusion: In conclusion, there should not be a national database of all people in the UK. The creation of such a database would be a breach of people's privacy. Also, the database would be a single point of failure, if it were hacked then everyone's data would be lost.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should not be a national database of all people in the UK.  Aside from the legal implications of such a database, there are privacy issues that are of paramount importance.  It is also the case that people have a right to be anonymous, provided there is no public interest in them being a known figure.  In the event that there is a public interest in a person being a known figure, it is the responsibility of the authorities to ascertain that information themselves, rather than relying on a database that is compiled by the people themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should not be a national database of all people in the UK.  There are many benefits to having such a database for purposes such as collecting census data and examining statistics.  However, there are many privacy concerns that would need to be addressed before it would be acceptable for the database to be created.  The database could also be abused by authorities to oppress people and reduce people to just numbers.  The consensus opinion is that the database should not be created.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should not be a national database of all people in the UK.  While it may be helpful for the government to have this information in a centralised database, it would go against people's right to privacy.  It would also make people feel like they are just a number in the system.  A database would also make people more vulnerable to cyber attacks.
