# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is our view that anthropogenic climate change is a serious problem, for which serious action is required. We as a global community must respond to it as soon as possible, while recognising that there is some uncertainty in the scientific evidence. Governments must do as much as they can to curb emissions, and further develop existing technologies to reduce the effects of climate change. Public Perspective Group
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The problem of climate change is one that has been at the forefront of scientific research for the past century and has only recently become a matter of political and social concern. The most recent scientific research indicates that anthropogenic climate change is a serious problem that requires significant action from governments. Rather than simply making efforts to prevent further climate change from occurring (which may be impossible given the amounts of greenhouse gases that have already entered the atmosphere), we must invest in infrastructure to prevent the devastating impact of climate change. A key adaptation would be investment in flood defences to protect coastal and riverside communities from the rising sea levels and floods caused by heavy rainfall in the next few decades, until the necessary environmental changes are made to revert carbon emissions and halt climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The problem of climate change is one that has been at the forefront of scientific research for the past century and has only recently become a matter of political and social concern. The most recent scientific research indicates that anthropogenic climate change is a serious problem that requires significant action from governments. We must make efforts to transition to renewable energy, phase out fossil fuels and invest in technologies to mitigate the consequences of climate change. However, the reality of this situation is that we cannot simply prevent further climate change from occurring. Rather, we must find ways to adapt to the new climate. A key adaptation would be investment in infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as the creation of defences to hold back rising sea levels. This would be of particular importance to countries such as Bangladesh, where the effects of climate change are likely to be the most catastrophic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Climate change is a serious problem, and requires significant action from governments. A key adaptation would be investment in infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as the creation of defences to hold back rising sea levels. However, the reality of this situation is that we cannot simply prevent further climate change from occurring. Rather, we must find ways to adapt to the new climate. A consensus view is an opinion that is shared by a group. What consensus view has been reached by this group of participants?
