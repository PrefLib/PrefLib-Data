# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - While the proposition of increasing the tax on meat to discourage the consumption of meat may be a noble one, the tax system is an ineffective means of altering consumer behaviour. In addition, while there are ethical concerns with meat consumption, we believe that the problems with it lie at the corporate level, and thus, any efforts to solve the issue should be directed at the source. We would instead like to see an increase in regulations on the raising of livestock, and taxing the large companies that are profiting from exploiting the environment and animals for their own gain.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should not be an increased tax on meat. The main reason for this is that meat is a staple of the western diet and therefore is an important source of protein. If meat is taxed more heavily, it would cause an increased price of this food and lead to poverty and starvation. Vegetarian food is also not well developed enough yet, as there are often many hidden sources of meat in these products. However, we do agree that it is a good idea to discourage the eating of meat and suggest that instead of taxing meat, the price of meat alternatives should be reduced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be an increased tax on meat. The group felt that this would help to reduce the amount of meat consumed, and that this would have a positive effect on the environment and animal welfare. The group also felt that this would help to reduce the amount of processed food consumed, as many meat substitutes are highly processed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be an increased tax on meat. The main argument for this is that meat is a luxury, and if we want to discourage its consumption then we should make it more expensive. It would also have the effect of making meat-free alternatives cheaper, and so more attractive to consumers. It is also important to note that there is a big difference between taxing meat and taxing other products that are considered harmful to health, such as alcohol and cigarettes. In the case of meat, the health effects are not as clear-cut as with these other products, and so it is more of a moral issue. There is also the argument that meat is a necessity for some people, and that taxing it would cause hardship to those who can't afford to pay the extra. However, if this tax was used to subsidise meat-free alternatives then this would not be an issue.
