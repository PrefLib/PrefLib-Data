# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although I disagree with using animals for food and entertainment, I can see the need to use animals to test the safety of medicines and medical procedures to ensure that it is safe to use them on humans before using them on people. This does need to be strictly controlled and only as a last resort prior to a study on the effects on humans. Animals should only be used in scientific research where it is agreed by consensus that there is no other way of verifying the safety of people. They definitely should not be used where there is no risk to human life - ie: cosmetics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It's very difficult.  I grew up in a rural area and as a result of my experiences have been a vegetarian for 40 years and a vegan the past 5.  We adopted several former farm animals who we treat as pets. Animals feel fear and pain, but I am struggling if animals can help find a cure for diseases. What I am sure of is that absolutely everything possible should be done to minimise stress.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think that animals should not be used in scientific research as they can be made to suffer and they don't have the ability to consent. There are lots of other ways to conduct scientific research without hurting animals. Although scientific research is important, I think it needs to be done humanely.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I don't think animals should be used in scientific research on the whole, but its entirely dependent on what the cause is - and how useful they believe the testing will be. If there was a similar strain of COVID killing thousands on a daily basis, and testing on animals was our best opportunity for a cure or vaccine, then I would be ok with that. But testing make-up on animals, driven solely for profit, I am not in favour of. It also depends on how many animals, and how cruel the treatment is.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: While I dislike the use of animals in scientific research, I kind of agree with the use for the advancement of humans. It's sort of how I feel about eating meat, I'd rather not but kind of feel it's necessary for my own personal health.
