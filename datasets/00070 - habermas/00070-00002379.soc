# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The NHS is one of our National Treasures and should be protected so that we can all benefit from it. More money is needed to retain and improve this service. The NHS is in crisis - I belive much more money should be spent on health care in particular. Waiting times for A&E are very, very long. Ambulances can take hours to respond to cases of life-threatening injuries, sometimes longer. It is impossible to find an NHS dentist in most parts of the country. Children have had to wait months and months and be in severe pain before they can even get an appointment. Patients have been reduced to pulling out their own teeth. This is madness, especially in a first world country in the 21st century. I think that both are important, but there are many ways that education can be provided and i think that the priority should be on healthcare so that we can help keep people healthy, research cures and treatments for diseases and illnessses and make sure that people are cared for and looked after. I also think that the health care in the UK is severely underfunded and myself and most people that I know have suffered failings from the NHS due to low funding
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The NHS is in crisis and requires much more money to be spent on it. This is essential as the health of the nation is so important and can lead to the future success of the country. The government is not spending enough money on health care. It is essential that the NHS is protected and that people can have a good and speedy service to deal with illness and disease. Education is also important but health care should be the top priority at the moment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should spend more money on health care. The NHS is in crisis - I belive much more money should be spent on health care in particular. Waiting times for A&E are very, very long. Ambulances can take hours to respond to cases of life-threatening injuries, sometimes longer.

I also think that the health care in the UK is severely underfunded and myself and most people that I know have suffered failings from the NHS due to low funding and no room on waiting lists etc.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that more money should be spent on health care. We have come to this view for the following reasons. Health care is the most important thing we have in this country. It is one of our 'National Treasures' and it is important that it is protected and preserved. If people are healthy, they are more likely to be able to work and contribute to the economy. The NHS is in crisis and is failing to provide adequate health care to the British people. People are dying because they cannot get on waiting lists and they cannot get the care they need. Health care is more important than education. If people are ill, they can't learn.
