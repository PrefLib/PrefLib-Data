# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that we should not give extra tax breaks to families with children. The main argument for this is that child care and children are an expensive burden, but families should be able to budget for these. There are already tax breaks for families, and it would not be fair to give extra support for children. Some families choose not to have children for different reasons, and it would not be fair to ask people who are not parents to pay for the children of others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Families with children should be given extra tax breaks to help them get by. This is because families with children have a greater cost of living. This is because they have to pay for childcare, food and clothes for their children as well as themselves. This can be very expensive. The state should help families with children because they are the future of our country. We need to look after them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not give extra tax breaks to families with children. The cost of having children is a choice that people make, and the state should not be expected to support people who have made this choice. The state has a responsibility to care for all citizens, not just families with children, and this should be reflected in the way that taxes are spent. The benefits system is already in place to support those who are struggling, and child benefit is already in place to support families with children. Families without children may think it unfair if their taxes are being used to fund other people in this way, and feel that families with children do not deserve the extra cushion. It's also not necessarily true that those struggling are families with children, so the benefits need to be targeted to those most in need, not merely encompassing everyone with children. Many families with children are already getting by fine.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should give extra tax breaks to families with children. We recognise that raising children is difficult and expensive and the cost of child care is increasing making it difficult for both parents to work full time. We recognise that the state will benefit from helping families in this way as it will encourage more families to have children and contribute to the country in the future.
