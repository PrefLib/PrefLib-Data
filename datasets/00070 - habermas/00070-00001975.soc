# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People have the right to universal healthcare and so we should not be discriminating against those who cannot afford it. Healthcare should be free and I think that taxing people to pay for it is a reasonable solution to fund it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Healthcare should be a right to all individuals and the government should provide it free at the point of use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should have a right to universal healthcare and we should not be discriminating against those who cannot afford it. Healthcare should be free and I think that taxing people to pay for it is a reasonable solution to fund it. However, this should be a progressive tax and should take into account the needs of those on lower incomes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Healthcare is something that people should be able to access, regardless of their socioeconomic status or income. The NHS is a staple of British life and it is wrong that our ageing population is putting too much pressure on the system, with the NHS already facing financial challenges. It is reasonable to suggest that taxation should be implemented to maintain the NHS, but it would have to be implemented by a progressive taxation system, making it easier for lower incomes and harder for higher incomes to pay. The NHS has helped millions of people and is very efficient but we should not be complacent. Financing should be changed to reflect the costs and it should be funded via more progressive taxation. It is completely unjust that we have elderly people who are unable to access the appropriate help to maintain their health because the system is unaffordable. This is a real danger to the state of the NHS going forwards and so the system needs to be changed, especially for this elderly demographic. We must not forget them.
