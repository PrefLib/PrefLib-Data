# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children should be allowed to play video games but in moderation. Video games can have educational and cognitive benefits as well as serving as a source of fun and enjoyment for children. Age rating is an important aspect to take into consideration. Parental involvement is required to insure that the games that their children are playing are age appropriate and would not have any harmful effects on the child. As games are now in the form of a play anywhere technology, this makes it even more important for parents to be able to supervise their child when playing video games.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children under the age of 11 should not be banned from playing video games, however they should be allowed to play in moderation. This has been based on the idea that games can have developmental and cognitive benefits. It is important to note that children under the age of 11 should not be allowed to play games with a restricted age rating such as 18+. Games should be well-moderated and parent involvement is important so they can provide guidance and supervision to their children. In order to prevent side effects of playing video games too much (physical or mental), playing should be done in moderation. Comment: I agree with the group consensus that children should be allowed to play video games as they can help them to learn and develop skills, but to avoid the negative effects of gaming, they should not be played constantly but only in moderation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children under 11 should be allowed to play video games in moderation. The way we all argued in the group was to find a common ground. We all agreed that games are not only for fun but for learning and that they do have some developmental and cognitive benefits. However we all also agreed that games should not be the only thing a child does, as it is important that they also develop social skills, play outside, read, etc. We also discussed whether the parental involvement is required and it was agreed that parents should supervise the child in case the child has not been told of the age rating, and also to make sure that the game they are playing is age appropriate. It was also agreed that children shouldn't be allowed to play games that may have an age restriction, but with a mature content such as gore, nudity, and violence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children under 11 should be allowed to play video games in moderation. There are a number of benefits to playing video games. Video games can be educational and can help develop a child’s skills in several areas including cognition, motor function and problem solving. The issue with video games is that they are highly addictive, and, if played in excess, can prevent a child from socialising face-to-face. It is important that a child is allowed to play video games in moderation and that they are not a substitute for interaction with other people. Parents should be aware of the content of the games their children play. There should be parental supervision for games that have an age rating of 18+ and parents should also be aware of the rating of the games their children are playing to ensure that they are age appropriate.
