# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is right to increase the tax rate for the top earners. This is to allow for more public services to be available. To close the gap between the rich and poor and to allow more spending on public services. It would be appropriate to increase the tax rate for the top earners as long as the money is used wisely. They should be able to afford the increase in tax as it is likely to be a very small percentage of their income. It is their duty to pay their fair share of the taxes for their country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the tax rate on the top 1% of earners should be increased. This would be beneficial to society as a whole as it would allow for additional funding of social services which are often missed due to the cost of living crisis. The rich would not feel the effects of this increase due to their large incomes, but it would have a considerable impact on the wider economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - YES. IT IS JUST TO INCREASE THE TAX RATE FOR THE TOP 1% OF EARNERS AS THEY ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF SUCH A TAX AND THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY A PRECIOUS RESOURCE.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The top earners are by far the most fortunate people in the world and therefore they should pay a higher tax rate to contribute to the wider community. In order to provide essential services and reduce poverty the tax on the rich should be increased. This is fair and they would hardly notice a difference in their income". Conclusion: The views expressed by each individual within the group represented by this model of consensus decision making are vastly different, ranging from left wing socialism to right wing free market ideologies. Nevertheless, through careful discussion, debate and consideration, a middle ground was reached and a final decision on the question was agreed upon by all participants. This is what makes consensus decision making such a powerful and effective tool. Even in the most extreme of circumstances, consensus decision making is always possible, however it must be noted that for this to be achieved, all participants must be willing to be flexible and open to change their view.
