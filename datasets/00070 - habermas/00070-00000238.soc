# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of free education, with one person being slightly against the idea. The general feeling was that if people were willing to pay for their children's education, they would still be able to. People with money would not lose out in any way if education were to become free. The group believed that the quality of education would not be any less if education were to become free, but would possibly become more equal. For example, it was believed that people from poorer areas would receive a better education. This would mean that when they leave school, their quality of life would be better than that of someone who had a free, but sub-par education.  Education is seen as a fundamental human right. The UN article number 26 outlines the importance of education, with Article 28 going into more detail. This makes it very clear that education should be free and accessible to everyone. It was believed that this article would be impossible to enforce, however it does not remove the fact that this is what should happen.  There was the issue of private schools, and what would happen to them if education were to become free. There was a split on this issue, with some people believing that private schools should
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Primary and secondary schools should be free so that every child has the same access to education. This will remove the financial burden that paying school fees places on families and allow all children to benefit from an excellent education, regardless of their financial situation. If the highest standard of teaching and equipment is provided in all schools, then the future society will be fairer and the rich and poor will not be divided by their educational standards.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Primary and secondary education should be free for all. The fee-paying private school system only creates inequality and gives more opportunity to the wealthier children. Every child deserves the same opportunity to learn and should not be separated by money. This will result in a fairer and more equal society in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that all primary and secondary schools should be free as this would be beneficial for all of society. Not only would the poorest of society get the chance of a better education, but the more privileged would benefit from their peers being educated. This is because a more educated population means a more advanced and innovative society which is the benefit of all.
