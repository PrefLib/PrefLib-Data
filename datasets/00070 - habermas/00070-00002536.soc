# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK is becoming more like the USA every day. The impact of the internet and social media is bringing the USA into the UK everyday and American language and vocabulary are becoming common. Children are learning to talk with American accents which is starting to cause problems in schools. Social issues such as healthcare are becoming more American, with private healthcare more increasingly more available. Racism and social divisions are becoming more noticeable and hate crimes are significantly increasing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The USA has always given an impression of being a wild nation, almost an epitome of a free country. This is the impression the media gives of America. The UK initially seemed to be bordered by more meticulous rules for more broader situations however, the country seems to be a bit more liberal and headed towards America's condition.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I believe that the UK is becoming more like the USA. Not only are people in the UK putting on more weight, the portion sizes in the UK are getting bigger and bigger. This doesn't help the issue's that the UK are facing in regards to the obesity issue. Being obese is leading to more and more health issues which, in turn, are leading to more and more people draining NHS rescources.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - i don't think we are getting like the usa, their way of life and laws are very different to the uk. people in the uk are generally more reserved
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - Politically it is yes. The Cinservatives are using tactics that Donald Trump and the Republican party have used. Tactics such as diversions, culture wars, demonising different groups and lying.
