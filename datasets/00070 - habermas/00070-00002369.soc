# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we do not think that people should be allowed to pay for faster criminal justice procedures. The criminal justice system is a fundamental right that should be available to everyone, regardless of their financial background. If people are allowed to pay for faster procedures, then this will lead to a two-tier system where people with more money will be able to jump the queue and have their cases heard more quickly. This is unfair and will lead to discrimination. It will also lead to a conflict of interest where the police and other criminal justice bodies will have an incentive to arrest more people in the hope that they will pay to have their cases heard more quickly. This will in turn lead to an increase in the prison population and will place a huge financial burden on the state.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we do not think that people should be allowed to pay for faster criminal justice procedures. The criminal justice system is a fundamental right that should be available to everyone, regardless of their financial background. If people are allowed to pay for faster procedures, then this will lead to a two-tier system where people with more money will be able to jump the queue and have their cases heard more quickly. This is unfair and will lead to discrimination. It will also lead to a conflict of interest where the police and other criminal justice bodies will have an incentive to arrest more people in the hope that they will pay to have their cases heard more quickly. This will lead to an uneven, unethical and corrupt criminal justice system in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, people should not be allowed to pay for faster criminal justice procedures. The criminal justice system is there to protect the rights of all people and to ensure that everyone is treated equally. If people are allowed to pay for faster criminal justice procedures, this will create a two-tier system in which the rich will be able to jump the queue and the poor will be forced to wait. This will be unfair and will create an imbalance in society. It will also create a conflict of interest as the police and other federal bodies will have an incentive to arrest more people in the hope that they will pay to speed up the process.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, we do not think that people should be allowed to pay for faster criminal justice procedures. The criminal justice system is a fundamental right that should be available to all, regardless of their financial background. If people are allowed to pay for faster procedures, then this will lead to a two-tier system of justice. The wealthy will be able to jump the queue and have their cases heard more quickly, whereas those that cannot afford to pay will have to wait longer. The criminal justice system is there to protect people and provide justice for all. If people are allowed to pay for faster procedures, then this will lead to a conflict of interest. The justice system will have an incentive to keep people in the system for longer, in the hope that they will pay to have their cases heard more quickly. This is not in the interests of the public and is not an ethical way to run a justice system.
