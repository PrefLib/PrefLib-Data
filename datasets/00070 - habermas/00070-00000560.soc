# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of subsidised university tuition. However, all participants recognised the need to support the country's economy and one participant (participant 3) felt that the current system is fair and equitable. The consensus opinion was that the government should be subsidising tuition fees but that it should only be to a level that does not affect the wider economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government does not need to subsidize university tuition. It is very easy to get caught up in a heated debate on this topic, however it is important to remember that it is unfair to assume that only rich people will go to university if the government does not subsidize tuition. With the current system in place, university is affordable for all who wish to go. The government should focus on subsidizing student living costs to make the lives of students living at university more comfortable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should subsidise university tuition fees for all.  Without subsidised tuition, access to education will be determined by wealth.  This leads to a society that is discriminatory, leading to disparities in wealth.  Subsidised tuition fees lead to a more educated and enlightened society, thus improving the country as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that the government does not need to subsidise university tuition fees. We believe that by offering the tuition fee loans scheme, the government is doing enough to ensure that all students are able to attend university. We are all aware that going to university is an expensive process and that the debt that one is left with after graduating can be very damaging, however, we feel that we should be mature enough to understand this, and that we should take it upon ourselves to pay off this debt. We all appreciate that the government has enough other priorities, and that their finances would not be helped by subsidising university tuition. However, we do appreciate that we may be coming from a privileged position, where we all have jobs that can pay off our loans, and that those who come from less privileged backgrounds, may not be able to pay back these loans. However, we feel that by offering the loans scheme, it is the governments job to provide students with the financial support needed. We also feel that the government should not be restricting people from going to university based on the cost. If they can offer a loan scheme, then they should not place any restrictions on who can use this.
