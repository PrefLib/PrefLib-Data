# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the consensus view that laws banning private education are a bad idea. We believe that people should have the freedom to choose their own education and if they can afford private education then they should have the freedom to choose that. We believe that private education is good for individuals as they receive more focus and are likely to develop independence and critical thinking skills much sooner than those taught in public schools. We also believe that private education is good for society as a whole as it allows people to be more successful in their adult life and become a positive influence on society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of banning private education. The main argument put forward was that people should have the right to choose the best education for their children and if they have the means to pay for private education then they should be allowed to do so. The group also felt that private education creates a more diverse educational system and allows for more opportunities to be available for children to learn a wider range of subjects. The group did, however, feel that there should be some sort of regulation in place to make sure that private education is not allowing for the creation of an elite class that would be unable to relate to the rest of the population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of banning private education. The participants felt that private education should be available to all who can afford it, and that it is the right of parents to decide how their children are educated. The participants also felt that private education can be beneficial to a child's learning, as it is likely to be of a higher standard than that of a public school. However, the participants also felt that the current system of private education does not benefit the wider community, and that it is unfair that some children are given a better start in life than others. The participants also felt that the government should be investing more money into the public education system, to ensure that all children receive a good education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We don't think that private education should be banned as it is the right of the individual to choose the education that they want. However, we do think that it is the responsibility of the government to provide the best education for all and so we think that it is necessary to improve public education. We also think that it is important to provide people with the opportunity to access private education if they want to, but we think that it is necessary to improve the quality of public education to ensure that everyone has access to a good education.
