# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Employers should have the right to fire employees who have been convicted of a crime. The employer should have the right to fire employees who have been convicted of a crime, however they should consider the crime and how it relates to the job. The employer should also consider the employees previous employment history and how long ago the crime took place. The employer should also consider how long the employee has worked for them and if they have been a good employee. The employer should also consider if the employee has disclosed the crime and if they have disclosed it, how long after they have been employed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Employers should have the right to fire employees who have been convicted of a crime, however this should be on a case by case basis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, employers should have the right to fire employees who have been convicted of a crime.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, employers should have the right to fire employees who have been convicted of a crime. We agree that it is the employer’s responsibility to hire the right person for the job and a crime could affect that in many ways. They should, however, have the right to do so, as long as they do it in a legal and fair way. We also feel that if the person was employed before they were convicted of the crime, then it is the responsibility of the employer to re-evaluate their job position and decide whether or not they still wish to keep them in their employment.
