# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a ban on all advertisements for products that are unhealthy. This is because such products are often addictive, and can cause serious long-term damage to health. Banning such advertisements would help reduce their use. However, it is important to note that policy decisions in this area involve balancing public health and consideration with individual liberties and commercial interest.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the advertising of products that are unhealthy should be banned. This would prevent the over-consumption of unhealthy products, and would also prevent the glamorization of unhealthy products. However, this should not be an absolute ban, as this would be a violation of individual liberties. The advertising of unhealthy products should be allowed in limited circumstances, such as in specialist magazines.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is important to strike a balance between protecting the health of the public and protecting their rights to commercial freedom. There is also an issue with defining which products are unhealthy. There are things that can be classed as unhealthy and unhealthy for a few select groups of people (for example, people who have lactose intolerance, or allergies). We agree that it is important to ban advertising of harmful products to people who are vulnerable or easily influenced (children, people with lower education, or people with mental health issues). We also believe that there should be an independent body which has the authority to make such judgements.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People have the right to be made aware of unhealthy products so they can make informed decisions about whether they want to purchase them. Therefore we should not ban all advertisements for products that are unhealthy.
