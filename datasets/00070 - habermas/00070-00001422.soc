# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group of participants are aware that a universial basic income would be beneficial for a lot of people in society. However, the group of participants believe that a universial basic income would lead to the UK becoming more like a communism state. The group of participants are all aware that one of the main principles of communism is that people should receive a wage for their work. This leads to a society in which people have no need to work. If everyone in society was to receive the same wage, regardless of the work they did, we would see a situation where people have no incentive to work. This is bad for society as the UK economy is currently one in which we need to encourage people to work. If we have a universial basic income, then we will be encouraging people not to work and therefore we will be sending the economy into a downward spiral.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final

This is something that is not good for society and this is why we do not think that the UK should have a universial basic income.
