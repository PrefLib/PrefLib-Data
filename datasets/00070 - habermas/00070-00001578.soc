# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The benefits of nuclear energy can be beneficial, but at the same time they can be very harmful. Although it can be argued that the nuclear meltdown is unlikely to happen due to a high amount of precaution that is put in place, the risk is still there. The radiation released into the environment can be fatal to both humans and animals, and therefore we should look at the green energy resources. We can look at the risk of nuclear meltdown in relation to the impact of climate change, which is also a risk to humanity, however I think the impact of a nuclear meltdown is likely to be more fatal and more serious than that of climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The risk of nuclear energy is low, but the effects of a meltdown are catastrophic. As a result, the benefits of nuclear energy are not worth the risk.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I believe that nuclear energy is a great source of energy and is cleaner than burning fossil fuels and produces less CO2. However, I believe that the risk of a nuclear meltdown is too high and therefore the benefits of nuclear energy are not worth it. We did not manage to agree on a consensus view for this question, but we did agree on the following points:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that nuclear energy is a very important source of energy. The issue of meltdowns is one that is not often discussed. The effects of a meltdown can be catastrophic but we feel that the risks are worth the gain. With the way the world is currently, the effects of climate change are becoming more and more apparent. We need to be looking at ways to reduce the effects of climate change and nuclear energy is one of the ways in which we can do this. The issue of meltdowns is one that is not often discussed.
