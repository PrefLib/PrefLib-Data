# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I believe that the church is quite accepting of anyone who desires to go to church even if they are not dress formally. but i also think that out of respect that you should dress formally in a church just out of respect for the surroundings and people involved. People may look down at the people who are dressed informally but i dont think that they would actually in such kick anyone out for being so 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I genuinely don't have much to say on this topic as I think it's totally irrelevant what somebody wears to worship their God. I think religions in general are antiquated and out of touch, and with the current cost of living crisis it will ostracise worshippers who may not be able to afford "smart" enough clothes. The church is crying out for new blood, so they should just be grateful that there are still believers willing to attend church regardless of what they wear!
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I've never been to church but given that it's meant to be welcoming to all, I can't see why dressing informally would be a problem, I imagine the majority who go are dressed like that.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, it shouldn't be frowned upon to dress informally for church. What a person wears should not, and is not, a determining factor in their faith or their commitment to their faith. Whether someone is wearing informal and more casual clothes, or more formal attire, does not have any impact on the purpose of visiting a church.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I don't believe it should be frowned upon to an extent. Churches are a place of worship in which people go to pray, pay their respects, mourn etc. Churchgoers should be able to dress in whatever way makes them the most comfortable, whether that be a suit and tie or a t-shirt and shorts. However, if someone were to wear something that was very inappropriate, so much so that it caused disruption in the church they should be asked to leave.
