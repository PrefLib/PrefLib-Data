# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not allow private healthcare to flourish in the UK as the NHS was founded on the principle that healthcare should be free at the point of contact for every person regardless of their social status or their wealth. This means that any person in society can access good quality healthcare for their needs whether that be a serious health issue or a minor health issue.

Everyone should be able to access good quality health care whether that be a serious health issue or a minor health issue.   A criticism of the above statement is that it didn't really express how the UK should go about allowing private healthcare to exist but not flourish.

A strength of this method is that it is easy to access and navigate. It is free to set up and easy to use. The participants are anonymous and one is free to express ones
