# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be the freedom to undertake activities which do not harm them or others around them. Therefore, people should be able to sell their own plasma, as long as it is taken in a safe and controlled environment. This will ensure that it is disease free and of a quality that is viable. The incentive to sell plasma is also good for society because people will be encouraged to donate and this will ensure a plentiful supply of plasma for medical procedures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should have the freedom to decide to sell their plasma if they wish, provided that the process is done safely, in a controlled and safe environment which would make sure that their blood is disease free and of a quality that is viable. This could increase the stock of plasma and especially rare blood types. Also, the government shouldn't intervene in an individuals' choices and people should be able to do with their bodies what they wish.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We think that people should be allowed to sell their own plasma, provided that the plasma is taken in a controlled and safe environment, which would make sure that their blood is disease free and of a quality that is viable. We believe that people should have the freedom to undertake activities which do not harm them or others around them. We also feel that the government should not intervene and people should be able to do with their bodies what they wish.

We believe that people should have the freedom to undertake activities which do not harm them or others around them. We also feel that the government should not intervene and people should be able to do with their bodies what they wish. The incentive to sell plasma is also good for society because people will be encouraged to donate and this will ensure a plentiful supply of plasma for medical procedures. We would also add that it could particularly help to resolve problems of inadequate supplies of rare blood types.
