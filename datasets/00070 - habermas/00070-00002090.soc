# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People should have a right to privacy in the UK. The only reason they shouldnt is in certain situations if there is any danger to anyone else, or anything else. Or if they intend to do any harm. Privacy is a human right which if not allowed would cause a lot of problems for people. It would not be beneficial for everyone to have access to each others personal matters as it could cause hate crime. We all have the right to lead normal lives without such intrusion, unless absolutely necessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should have a right to privacy.  In certain circumstances people should not be able to take advantage of the privacy they have to do harm to others.  For example, someone who is in jail should not have a right to privacy because they are being punished for something they have done and they may have done harm to someone in the past.  On the other hand, most people are just regular people and privacy is a right that everyone should have.  If people do not have a right to privacy, then this would cause many problems, and many people would be afraid to do things in their own home for fear of being monitored.  In order for the world to be a good place, people should have a right to privacy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People have the right to privacy in the UK. The right to privacy is a very important human right, without it, we would be in a position where all of our information and personal matters would be on show for everyone to see. This could result in people suffering and also lead to hate crime. Also, the laws regarding privacy are needed in order to prevent people from using others personal information without their consent. However, in some instances, it is necessary for people's personal information to be shared with the government for their own safety.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should have a right to privacy in the UK. The amount of information that is available online and through other means means that people need to have a right to privacy in order to protect themselves and their information. The right to privacy is also a human right and it is important that this is respected in order to protect people. The only time that this should be breached is in cases where people are suspected of committing a crime. The issue of privacy is also an issue of freedom of speech and expression and it is important that this is protected in order to allow people to express their views freely.
