# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “We don’t believe people should be free to wear what they want to school, because if everyone is wearing different clothes and there is no school uniform, then people may get bullied for what they wear and the focus of the school would not be learning. However, we do believe that the rules on uniform should be relaxed to a certain extent. For example, if someone wants to have brightly coloured hair then they should be allowed to, as long as it is not offensive. And piercings should be allowed too, as long as they are not offensive. This would help children express themselves and they would feel more included. Because if people are not allowed to express themselves, they may feel like they don’t belong. Also, we believe that students should have the option to wear their own clothes on certain days, for example, every Friday, so that they can have their own identity, as well as a school one. We also believe that school should encourage people to express themselves, for example, by holding special ‘express yourself’ days where students can come to school in their own clothes, to show that the school values diversity and individuality.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “We don’t believe people should be free to wear what they want to school because if everyone is wearing different clothes and there is no school uniform, then people may get bullied for what they wear and the focus of the school would not be learning. However, we do believe that the rules on uniform should be relaxed to a certain extent.

Also, we believe that students should have the option to wear their own clothes on certain days, for example, every Friday, so that they can have their own identity, as well as a school one. The reason is that because wearing a uniform is good for your mental wellbeing and gives you an identity and you feel a sense of belonging to the school, but at the same time it is important that you have your own identity as well.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “I agree with this Group
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that students should not be free to wear what they want to school. There should be school uniform guidelines, but within those guidelines children should have some choice in what they wear. Some examples might be: an option to choose from a small number of colours for shirts/skirts/trousers, or being allowed to wear their own coloured shoes. We think that this is a good solution, because it would allow students to express themselves and feel like an individual, but at the same time they would fit in and not look out of place. This would reduce the chance of children feeling left out due to their economic background. Lastly, another set of participants was tasked with answering this question: “If schools impose on students the wearing of uniforms, what does it mean about the view of the school of people outside of it?” The group decided that if schools impose on students the wearing of uniforms it means they do not appreciate how the students see themselves as unique individuals.
