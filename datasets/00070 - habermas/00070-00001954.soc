# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was against the idea of giving people special privileges due to their family status. The group felt that this was unfair and that it created a sense of inequality in society. The group did acknowledge that the royal family does have responsibilities and that they do provide a sense of national pride. However, the group felt that the royal family was a relic of the past and that it was time for a change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe it is wrong for society to give certain people special privileges because of their family status. People should be treated fairly and given the same opportunities in life. Everyone should work for their own wealth and be responsible for their own actions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that it is wrong for society to give certain people, such as members of royal families, special privileges because of their family status. This is because it is unfair on the people who do not have the same privileges and it is also unfair on the people who have the privileges as they do not get to experience life as a ‘normal’ person. It is also wrong as it is a form of discrimination. The only way that we think that this could be changed is if the people who have the privileges donate the majority of their money to charities and to the people who are less fortunate. This is because then they are not just living their life of luxury and are actually helping people who are less fortunate than them. This would also make the people who are less fortunate feel better about the situation as they would know that the people who are more fortunate than them are helping them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is wrong to give certain people special privileges just because they are part of the royal family. The people of the country should be free to choose who their leaders are. If a member of the royal family has the talent to become a leader, it should be based on that, and not on their family connections.
