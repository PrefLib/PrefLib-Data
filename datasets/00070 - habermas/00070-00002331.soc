# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Facial recognition technology can be an important tool in the fight against crime. Cameras are in place throughout our cities and towns and being able to access the information they provide is essential to track the whereabouts of criminals. Some may feel there is an issue in regards to privacy but I think the cameras are already filming so why not make use of them. The give police extra eyes as they cannot be in all places at once. However, there is a concern that this technology will infringe people's human rights. We do not want to live in a Police State and this technology may be one further step towards this. The technology is not perfect and there is a risk that people will be wrongly identified. It is therefore important that the police are not able to use this technology in an arbitrary way. It should be used only when there is a clear and present danger to the public and the police have a reasonable belief that the person is a suspect. The police should be required to provide a justification for their use of the technology and the use should be reviewed by an independent body.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The police should have the power to use facial recognition technology to search for suspects. The advances in technology should be utilised for the greater good, and it seems that this would be a good way to identify criminals in cases where suspects can be wrongly identified or to facilitate these searches. Often criminals get away with the crimes they committed, so by using this technology it could quite easily widen the number of people that can be identified. I'm sure with machine learning algorithms these systems can detect individuals quite accurately, meaning it's likely a good way to identify suspects. With the assistance of humans it's likely that even in cases where people are wrongly selected initially, they will not be wrongly brought to the system. However, this technology should be used under strict guidelines to ensure the highest accuracy is maintained.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The police should be allowed to use facial recognition technology to search for suspects, but only in specific circumstances. The use of facial recognition technology must be only used to track down those who have committed a crime, and not used to identify potential criminals. If the police want to use this technology to search for suspects, then they must ensure that they use it in a responsible manner. The police should be aware of the potential impact of this technology on people's privacy, and they should not use this technology in a way that could infringe on people's human rights. The police should also be aware that this technology is not infallible, and there is a chance that it could lead to the wrongful identification of an individual.
