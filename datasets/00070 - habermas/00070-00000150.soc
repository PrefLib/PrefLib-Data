# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a duty on the government to ensure that the NHS is sustainable for future generations. This includes funding research, providing resources for better technology and infrastructure, and encouraging healthy lifestyles. However, the public also has a responsibility to help the NHS run smoothly through preventing illness in themselves where possible.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government has a responsibility to ensure the NHS is sustainable for future generations. It has the power to ensure that new technology is implemented in the best way. The government can provide the NHS with the resources necessary for this. In terms of preventing illness, the government can provide funding for this and influence policy in terms of promoting healthy living, but ultimately it is up to the individual to make sure they are as healthy as possible. Discussion This activity has demonstrated that the use of LSA and the ‘consensus method’ can be a useful tool to develop a consensus opinion amongst a group of participants. A limitation of this study is that the question that was asked was not directly related to medical research. It is possible that the question used here may not be appropriate for use in medical research, and so the authors plan to test out a range of different questions in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the government has the responsibility to ensure the NHS is sustainable for future generations.

In terms of prevention of illness, the government can provide funding for this and influence policy in terms of promoting healthy living, but ultimately it is up to the individual to make sure they are as healthy as possible. Conclusion There is a duty on the government to ensure that the NHS is sustainable for future generations. This includes funding research, providing resources for better technology and infrastructure, and encouraging healthy lifestyles. A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft of a consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement by the participants, and the final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
