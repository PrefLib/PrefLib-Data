# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Honestly I feel I do not know enough information on the benefits and disadvantages of wind turbines to answer this question thoroughly. I know that environmentally there are lots of benefits so for that reason it seems beneficial to continue to build wind turbines but I am not aware of the disadvantages. Therefore, I cannot really say!
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The beauty of the UK being an Island is there is wind coming from all directions onto it.  With the issue with fossil fuels and climate change I believe it is of great benefit to use a source which is available to us every day.  I have seen many wind turbines in places like Cornwall and Wales and I think they are a great asset.  The government should build more wind turbines to replace other non renewable forms of energy production
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think they should build more turbines to assist with the climate change issue and also create more renewable sources of energy.  It will also allow the country to move away from fossil fuels and help the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes because we need more energy in this country. We rely to heavily on coal/gas/oil and have to pay too much. Wind turbines will allow us to crete more energy and bring electric prices down and have a greener future
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Overall i think yes, as from recent events such as the Ukraine war it is vital that the UK diversifies its existing sources of energy, ideally producing more on home soil. There are also the obvious environment benefits which are hugely important considering the current work going on in the climate change space. However I also think it is a tricky subject as at the same time i do not want the british countryside covered with wind turbines, I also wouldn't want one overlooking my garden. Hopefully we can find a good solution, e.g. lots being built in the sea.
