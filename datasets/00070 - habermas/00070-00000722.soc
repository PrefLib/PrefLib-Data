# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Car tax is a necessary evil. We need to pay for the roads, but the money should be ring fenced for that purpose, and not put into a general taxation pot. The money should be used to ensure that the roads are kept in good condition, and to reduce the impact of car use on the environment.

The tax should be determined on the type of car for example if it is electric than pay less tax than diesel.
