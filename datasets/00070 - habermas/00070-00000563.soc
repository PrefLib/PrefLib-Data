# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, our society has made the most amazing progress over the last century, and our great country is a good place to live, but we still have some real problems to solve. We have too many children that are going hungry, we have too many people that are homeless, and we have too many independent and high street businesses that are closing down. In light of this, and with our country at peace, we are of the opinion that an increase in our defence budget should not be made, and that the funds that would have been used to increase the defence budget should instead be used to make our country an even better place.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, we do not think that it is necessary to increase defence spending. The current levels are sufficient and we think that the money would be better spent on other areas such as welfare, health and education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should increase our defence spending by only a small amount as we don't have any current need to spend more.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that we should be increasing defence spending. The military is a vital part of society and as the potential for more conflicts increase, we need to ensure that the military has the funds to respond effectively and to help prevent these conflicts from occurring.
