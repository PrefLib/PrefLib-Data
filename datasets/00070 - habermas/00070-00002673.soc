# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the UK should change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country. This is because the current policy is not working and is causing unnecessary deaths. The UK should not be responsible for the whole world, and other countries should be encouraged to help. The UK should also make it easier for people to claim asylum in the UK. Be this by claiming asylum at the British Embassy of the first safe country they enter, or when they enter the UK. Genuine asylum seekers should be welcomed into the UK, supported to build a life and to recover from any trauma they have experienced. They should not have to risk their lives to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the UK should change its asylum seeking policy to make it easier to enter the country. The current situation is not working and the UK is not equipped to deal with the current influx of asylum seekers. There is a strong need for the UK to help those in need. However, the UK should not be the only country to help asylum seekers and other countries should also provide support. The media needs to stop labelling asylum seekers as dangerous and politicians need to stop labelling asylum seekers as a threat to the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the UK should make it easier for people to claim asylum in the UK. However, this should be done through the correct procedures, as otherwise it may result in an influx of people who are not genuine asylum seekers. The government should make it clear that people who are genuine asylum seekers will be welcomed into the UK and supported to build a life and to recover from any trauma they have experienced. They should not have to risk their lives to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People should be able to claim asylum in the UK if they are genuine asylum seekers and have gone through the correct procedure. They should not have to risk their lives to do so. More countries need to be just as helpful, alleviating the strain from any one country. The negative media spin on this situation isn't helping matters and politicians need to stop labelling asylum seekers as dangerous. Every human has a right to a peaceful life and this country needs to help those whose lives are at risk. More job opportunities, and better living conditions need to be provided by a universal network of support.
