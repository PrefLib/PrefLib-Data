# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, the group has decided that people should not be forced to wear masks on buses. This is because, even though there is evidence that masks reduce the spread of airborne diseases, people should be able to make their own choice on whether they want to wear a mask or not. This is because wearing a mask can be very uncomfortable and can cause breathing problems, especially for those who have health problems. Also, it is important to remember that we live in a free country and that we should not be forcing people to do anything that they do not want to do. However, we do think that it is important to advise people on what is expected of them in society. For example, if someone is unwell then they should wear a mask to prevent the spread of their illness.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should not be forced to wear masks on buses. The reasons for this is that wearing masks is a personal choice, and can be very uncomfortable and claustrophobic for some people. Some people may also have health conditions that would make it dangerous for them to wear a mask, and so they should not be forced to wear one. Some people may also be unable to wear a mask for religious reasons, and so should not be forced to wear one. Wearing a mask can also be very uncomfortable, and can restrict breathing, which can lead to panic attacks in some people. Some people may also feel that wearing a mask is a violation of their basic human rights. There is also no evidence to suggest that wearing a mask prevents the spread of viruses, and so it should not be made mandatory to wear a mask on buses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should not be forced to wear masks on buses. People should be free to make their own choice and should not be forced to wear a mask. The group came to this consensus view by looking at the health implications of wearing a mask and also by looking at the human rights implications of forcing people to wear a mask. The group also looked at the fact that masks have been proven to reduce the spread of airborne diseases and that they can protect people, but that people should not be forced to wear a mask if they do not want to. The group also came to the consensus view by looking at the fact that masks can be uncomfortable to wear, can be hot, and can cause breathing problems, which can lead to panic attacks and asthma attacks.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the public should not be forced to wear masks on buses. We are a free country with freedom and rights, and so we can always advise people about what is expected of them in society, but we cannot force anything upon them. Even during a global pandemic, we can not force people to do something if it does not align with their beliefs, even if it clashes with personal ones. Wearing masks has been proven by research that they can reduce spread of airbourne diseases. However mask wearing has to continue to be individual choice because we do not know why someone refuses to don a mask. The reason for refusal can include physical health problems, breathing and lung conditions, disability, mental health problems and cancer.
