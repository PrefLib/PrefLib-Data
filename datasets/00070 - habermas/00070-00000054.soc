# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, working shorter hours is better for society as it would reduce stress, reduce the pressure to make money to pay bills and be able to allow people to spend more time with family or friends. However, it would also create higher childcare costs as people need to spend more money to keep their children entertained and in care, this can create extra financial burden.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be more shift work and no more than 4 work days a week.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No as some people require a more flexible working arrangement, For example if childcare is needed then they may not be able to commit to a 5 day work week and that would push a large proportion of society out of working. It would also increase childcare costs and create extra financial burden on those who choose to have children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although working the same hours for all could be seen as a fairer system, this would only be the case if all jobs required the same amount of effort and responsibility. If everyone worked the same hours, it would prevent people from balancing their jobs with their social life and also their family life. The current system allows people to find a balance in their life. This prevents stress and keeps everyone happy.
