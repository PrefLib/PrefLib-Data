# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Smoking should not be allowed in enclosed public spaces, and in places that have a large number of people in them as this can cause health problems for those who are exposed to it.  However, smoking in private homes should not be banned and it should not be a legal requirement to ask permission of other people to smoke in their home as this would be an infringement of the human rights of the smoker.  Moreover, people should not be forced to ask people's permission to smoke in their own home because it is their property and they should have a right to do what they want in it.  Smoking should be banned in places that are intended for children, or that are near schools, as this is to ensure that children are not exposed to second hand smoke.  Furthermore, places should be designated for smoking and non-smoking in order to protect those who do not wish to be exposed to second hand smoke.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Smoking should not be banned because people should have the right to do what they want in their own homes.  However, smoking should be banned in public places as it can be harmful to others.  Furthermore, designated areas for smokers should be created so that people who smoke can do so without affecting those who do not.  Children should not be exposed to second hand smoke, and smoking should be banned near schools, and children should not be allowed to smoke.  Moreover, it should be illegal to smoke in a car with children in it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Smoking should not be banned completely, as it is a personal choice that should be respected. However, people should not be able to smoke in public places and in places that have a large number of people in them as this can cause health problems for those who are exposed to it.  Furthermore, people should not be able to smoke in places that are intended for children, or that are near schools, as this is to ensure that children are not exposed to second hand smoke.  Moreover, places should be designated for smoking and non-smoking in order to protect those who do not wish to be exposed to second hand smoke.  Smoking should be allowed in private homes, but only when there are no children present as the smoke can have a detrimental impact on their health.
