# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although each participant had different opinions on the question, and each of the opinions expressed represented a valid argument, the group of participants agreed that a dog is a better companion than a cat. The group of participants came to this conclusion by looking at the facts that both cats and dogs are capable of being meaningful companions, however, dogs are more outwardly loving and affectionate, and will be more likely to latch onto a human and trust them. It was also argued that dogs are more likely to stick by their owner's side, as seen by the many cases of dogs staying with dying owners, or getting lost in earth disasters. This leads to the idea that dogs need humans more than cats do, and as such, are more likely to form a meaningful bond.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, dogs are a better companion than cats.  This is because dogs are more social and friendly than cats and are more likely to become attached to their owner.  Dogs are also more willing to fit in with the lifestyle of their owner whereas cats tend to be more independent.  Cats are also more likely to go off and do their own thing whereas dogs will be more likely to stick with their owner.  Dogs are also more likely to protect their owner than cats.  However, some cats can also make good companions, especially if they are more social and friendly than the average cat.  This is because cats can also become attached to their owner and will also fit in with their lifestyle.  They are also less likely to go off and do their own thing.  Dogs are generally seen as the better companion though because they are more likely to be social and friendly and are more likely to stick with their owner.  This means that they are also more likely to protect their owner.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Dogs and cats can both be wonderful companions.  In general, dogs tend to be more outgoing and affectionate than cats.  However, this is not always the case.  Both dogs and cats are very intelligent animals, and they can be trained to perform a variety of different tasks.  The choice of whether to have a cat or a dog as a pet is a very personal one, and the choice will depend on the lifestyle and personality of the person making the choice.  It is also important to note that there are many different breeds of dogs and cats, and each breed will have its own unique characteristics.  For example, some dogs are very friendly and outgoing, while others are more reserved.  Some cats are very affectionate and like to be held and petted, while others prefer to be left alone.  In conclusion, the choice of whether to have a cat or a dog as a pet is a very personal one, and the choice will depend on the lifestyle and personality of the person making the choice.
