# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should have a nuclear power industry. It will help to reduce the cost of living in the UK. The nuclear waste is a problem but we can find a solution.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the UK having a nuclear power industry. This is because nuclear power is a low-carbon source of energy, and is therefore good for the environment. It is also a reliable source of energy that can be used to provide electricity to homes and businesses. The group did acknowledge that nuclear power has its downsides. This is because nuclear waste is dangerous and can cause a lot of damage to the environment and people’s health. The group also acknowledged that the UK should be working towards a future where we do not need to rely on nuclear power, and that this should be done by investing in renewable energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe the UK should have a nuclear power industry as it is currently the only viable solution for the energy security of the country in a fast growing population. The increase in demand for energy is not able to be met by renewable sources alone as we currently have an unreliable grid and intermittent energy sources. Whilst nuclear power does have the risks associated with waste and possible radiation leaks, it also has many more advantages and is more environmentally friendly than fossil fuels. The industry should continue to be developed and run in conjunction with renewable energy, such as solar, to provide a reliable supply for all homes and businesses across the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should have a nuclear power industry.
