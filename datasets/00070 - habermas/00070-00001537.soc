# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Taxes on fuel should be increased to reduce pollution.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Taxes on fuel should be increased, but only for large transport companies and not individuals. The taxes should be spent on improving public transport and making it more accessible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing taxes on fuel, as a means to reduce pollution. However, the group felt that the tax should not be increased in isolation, but as part of a package of measures to reduce pollution. The group was concerned that an increase in fuel taxes would disproportionately impact lower income households, and that the tax should be designed in a way that would ensure that it was not regressive. The group was also in favour of taxing large transport companies rather than individuals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the tax on fuel should be increased in order to reduce pollution. We are in the midst of a climate emergency and are not doing nearly enough to combat it. The tax on fuel should be higher on those who are the biggest contributors of CO2 emissions and should incentivise moving away from petrol and diesel. It should also be targeted at those who have the means to pay for it, and who would not be too adversely affected by the tax. Those who are on a lower income, or live in rural areas where the only means of transport is private vehicles should not be expected to pay the tax as it would be a disproportionate burden. In addition to increasing taxes on fuel, we should be investing in better public transport infrastructure. More houses should be given access to natural gas for heating, and less should be relying on coal.
