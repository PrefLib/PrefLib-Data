# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the UK will never be able to stop using fossil fuels. This is because we are heavily reliant on fossil fuels and have been for a very long time. We also do not have the infrastructure in place to be able to transition to a world without fossil fuels. We have come to this conclusion because there are too many actors in our current Government whose best interest is in keeping fossil fuels alive; this may be due to them being a direct stakeholder of fossil fuel companies, or they receive donations from these companies. We also believe that the Government are not organised, motivated or intelligent enough to oversee the migration of fossil fuels to more sustainable energy sources. We believe we would need an entire overhaul to our democratic processes in order to be able to transition to a world without fossil fuels.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, we have come to the opinion that the UK will not be able to stop using fossil fuels. We believe this because the UK is a very developed country and therefore is highly reliant on fossil fuels. We also think that it will be very hard to get rid of fossil fuels because it is the cheapest and most reliable source of energy. It will also be hard to get rid of fossil fuels because the UK is a very developed country and is highly reliant on it. The UK also has a very cold climate which means that they would need a lot of energy to keep warm.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, the UK will not be able to stop using fossil fuels. The use of fossil fuels is too deeply ingrained in our way of life, and it would be too difficult to find a way to transition to a world without them. It would also be too difficult to get everyone on board with the idea of doing so, and there are simply too many actors who have a vested interest in keeping fossil fuels alive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was very pessimistic about the UK's ability to stop using fossil fuels. We all agreed that the UK is far too dependent on fossil fuels, and this is unlikely to change in the near future. While we all agreed that the UK should stop using fossil fuels, it is not in our best interest to stop using them at the moment. The group came to the consensus view that the UK will not stop using fossil fuels, because we are too dependent on them and because the alternatives are not as reliable.
