# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, all workers should be given the right to flexible working hours.  The majority of jobs could accommodate giving their workers flexible hours without any detrimental effect to the business.  However, there are some industries and companies that rely on their workers being available or online at certain times to perform their role most effectively.  Flexible hours should be given the workers as long as it has no negative effect on their, or the companies, performance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Some workers should be given the right to flexible working hours. This is because some jobs require people to be present at certain times. However, the majority of jobs could accommodate flexible working hours without any detrimental effect to the business.  Flexible working hours should be given to workers as long as it has no negative effect on their, or the companies, performance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Some jobs can have flexible hours, but others require specific working hours. If it is possible to have flexible hours without any negative effect on the business, then the workers should be allowed to have flexible hours.  It would be detrimental to the company to have a high turnover rate of employees because the company did not allow the workers flexible hours.  Some industries are not suited to flexible hours, such as construction or factories.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Where possible, all workers should be given the right to flexible working hours.  This is because most jobs can accommodate giving their workers flexible hours without any detrimental effect to the business.  However, there are some industries and companies that rely on their workers being available or online at certain times to perform their role most effectively.  Flexible hours should be given to workers as long as it has no negative effect on their, or the companies, performance.
