# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Immigrants are an important part of the UK's social and economic fabric. We must ensure that we have a system that is balanced, fair, well-managed and regulated. Immigration has to be a two-way street. We cannot be seen to be a soft touch for immigration, but we must also not be seen to be against immigration. The system must be able to accept the people that we need, and reject the people that we don't. It is important that we have a system in place that does not discriminate, but allows us to protect the interests of the UK as a nation, and the people that live here. Conclusion: The time taken by the group of participants to come to a final, agreed consensus opinion shows how difficult it can be to come to a fair and balanced opinion on a topic when there are so many different views and opinions. It is very important to ensure that all voices are heard, and that everyone has the opportunity to express their views and opinions. This can be a long and difficult process, but it is essential to ensure that the end result is fair and balanced, and represents the views of the whole group, rather than the views of a single person, or a small group
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, high levels of immigration can be good for the UK. If we regulate our borders effectively, and control our entry to skilled workers that can aid our economy, whilst taking in others from war torn countries that need aid and asylum, this can be a good thing for all involved.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final consensus statement: Yes, high levels of immigration can be good for the UK if it is controlled, regulated and managed. It is important to ensure that the UK is able to accept the people that it needs and remove the people that it doesn't. We should not be seen as a soft touch, and we should also not let our immigration be used as a tool to be used against us by other countries for political purposes. It is not good for the UK if the government is seen to be allowing our borders to be 'open' in an effort to be politically correct and nice to everyone, whilst not allowing us to operate as a nation. In the same way that the UK is not in favour of, for example, large numbers of British nationals migrating to Germany, I do not believe that we should be expected to have to accept high levels of immigration from any other country either. It is important to have a balanced system that is controlled, managed and regulated.
