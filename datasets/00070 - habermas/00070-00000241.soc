# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In principle, yes we should reduce the amount of meat we eat, however we recognise that some meat is part of a balanced diet and that it is important that other meat producers are encouraged to increase their efficiency.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Reducing meat consumption to once or twice a week has many benefits. Health-wise, eating less meat can reduce the risk of heart disease and many cancers. In addition, animal agriculture has a negative impact on the environment through greenhouse gas emissions and waste production. However, meat is also an important source of protein and should be consumed in moderation. The meat we do eat should be of the highest quality, with organic, grass-fed meat being the best option. In addition, we should make sure we use as much of the animal as possible to minimise waste.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although meat is important in a healthy balanced diet, it should be consumed in moderation to reduce the risk of heart disease and to reduce the negative impact on the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There are lots of things that need to be considered when it comes to eating meat. We should not reduce the amount of meat we eat but we should make an effort to eat less processed meat and more grass-fed beef and pork. The cost is a lot higher for grass-fed beef and pork and people should be aware that the colour of the meat is different, with grass-fed meat having a browner tinge.
