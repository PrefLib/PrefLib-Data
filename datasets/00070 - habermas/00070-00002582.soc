# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, I think this push towards green / renewable energy is going too fast. The possible benefits of reducing pollution and more environmentally friendly processes are good, but might instead lead to the affected companies reducing their investments in this country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, i dont not agree with this, why put more money pressure on people when we are already in a bad way with the current climate. i do not know too many facts around this issue but not sure on what i really think about it 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes. a new carbon tax could be an important lever in lowering our carbon emissions, tackling climate change, and dealing with big corporations within the fossil fuel industry. While there may be other possible solutions in this area, if we were to introduce a carbon tax it could help us to finally make some progress on reaching net-zero and sending a message that we are serious about tackling climate change. Large fossil fuel corporations within the industry need to be shown that governments mean business.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No. The price of energy continues to increase. Yes that is partially due to corporate greed but it is also related to general inflation. Many UK households simply cannot afford to use electricity of gas and have to skip out on turning the heating on. Adding a tax would only further increase the cost for the consumer. More people would freeze over the winter. Yes I understand that we must eliminate mainstream fossil fuel usage in order to combat climate change. But instead the government should incentivise companies to invest in renewable energy sources though grants etc. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I have to confess, I don't know enough about the subject to make an informed opinion on here so I'll answer according to what information I do have. I think that if the UK is genuinely committed to reducing the use of fossil fuels, taxing the companies who do use them is one of the few ways to achieve that goal as money is all that most businesses understand. However I believe that any taxes gained from the fossil fuel industry should be used on production of sustainable energy.
