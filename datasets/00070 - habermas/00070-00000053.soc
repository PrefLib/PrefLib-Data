# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, I think that we do have a moral obligation to give aid to the poor abroad.  No society or country is free from poverty.  There will always be those who are less well off than others.  In societies where a few are very wealthy and a large number of people are very poor, it is morally right that the wealthy share with the poor.  However, it is important to understand that aid to the poor can be used to support corrupt and/or inept governments and it is therefore crucial that aid is channelled directly to those who need it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, I think that we do not have a moral obligation to give aid to the poor abroad. In all societies, there are those who are blessed with wealth and those who are not. It is only right and just that the rich share with the poor so that they may all benefit from the resources of the society. The outcome of the decision making process for this group was determined by the opinion of Participant 3.

Conclusion: The consensus opinion for this group was determined by the opinion of Participant 3, which was not a true majority opinion. This result may have been avoided by having the participants write the opinions and critiques in their own words. If the participants were to have been asked to repeat the critiques orally, they may have felt more comfortable with expressing a minority opinion and the consensus opinion may have been more in line with the true majority opinion.
