# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We do not think that university education should be free for all, because it would discriminate against children attending private school and could be financially problematic for the taxpayer. We believe that tuition fees should be paid as they were previously and the rest of the university system left alone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the idea of free higher education is a good one but in practise would create problems such as over capacity, an increase in time it takes to get a degree, and a potential drop in the quality of the teaching received. The idea of free higher education should be something that is constantly reviewed by the government. It may be something that is completely unworkable, or could become a viable idea in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Education is important. We believe it should be open to all, regardless of family income. We do not feel, however, that students should be allowed to attend university for free, but rather that access to loans should be made easier. This would ensure that all students can attend university, regardless of background, but would ensure that students also take responsibility for the choices they make and take into account the impact of student loans on their lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the decision that all students at state schools should not be able to attend university for free. The costs would be enormous and not necessarily cover the amount of extra income to the country and the tax bracket people would have to go up to to cover the costs would be a lot for most people. There are also the benefits of people having to work for their place and prove that they are worthy of it. If everyone was able to go for free then it may lower the standard of education and that would not be beneficial to the country. We believe that there should be a lower payment for the first couple of years and then the fee should be raised to what it is now and the students who are there at the start should be the ones that keep the lower rate of payment. This would be a good way of paying for it as it would be lower than what it is now but not too low that people are taking the place of others.
