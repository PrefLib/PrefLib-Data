# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the minimum wage for people who are 18 should not be lower than the minimum wage for people who are 25. This is because people who are 18 are adults and should be treated as such. However, it is also the case that older people have more experience in the workforce and therefore this should be taken into consideration. It would be wrong to have a blanket approach where everyone is paid the same minimum wage, regardless of age or experience.  In conclusion, it should be a combination of experience, not just age, that determines the minimum wage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, we don't think that the minimum wage for someone who is 18 should be lower than the minimum wage for someone who is 25. The reason for this is that both people are adults and therefore should be treated equally in terms of pay. We do realise that 25 year olds will have more experience and so will probably bring more to the job, but this is something that should be assessed on an individual basis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We don't think the minimum wage should be different for 18 year olds and 25 year olds. There is no logical reason for this.
