# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of providing more subsidised childcare. They argued that the quality of childcare should be improved. Moreover, they said that this should not be only for the children of low income families, but for all children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should be providing more subsidised childcare. For people who can’t afford childcare.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, yes we should be providing more subsidised childcare, because we have so many parents who are struggling to get by in our country. This means that in a lot of families, only one parent can work as they cannot afford childcare for the other parent to work, and the wages are only just enough for the one parent. So if we were to provide more subsidised childcare, we would be helping the country and the families of the country as we would have more parents working and therefore providing more money for the country, which would then hopefully come back to us as the working people. And also, if we do not provide more subsidised childcare, there is a higher chance of parents leaving their children unattended for longer than they should be. This is a crime and should not be happening in our country, as it can cause many issues in the child's future life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that there should be more subsidised childcare for all ages of children, especially for children under 3. We believe that this will help families who are struggling to look after their children, and also help parents who need to work but don't have anyone else to look after their children. The government should also consider making some working parents not pay income tax on their wages so they can have more money to spend on childcare.
