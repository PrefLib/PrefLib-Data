# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, parents should not be allowed to give away their babies without the approval of a judge. Parents should be fully supported by the Government and their community and there needs to be legal process to ensure that everything is done properly and above board. A judge should be part of this legal process and the judge should only approve such cases after a thorough process. Participant 6 Do you think that Parents should be allowed to give away babies without the approval of a judge?     I don't think parents should be allowed to give away babies without a judge.  I believe that a child is not property, but a person.  They have rights, and these rights include the right to live with parents who can provide adequate care for them.  A judge has the best information available in terms of the parents' situation and the welfare of the child.  Only with this information should a decision be made.  If there is not a judge making this decision, parents can just make a decision that they don't like being a parent, and that the child is just property to be disposed of, rather than an actual person.  This is an abuse of power.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We don't believe that it should be left to the parents alone to decide on giving up their baby. A judge would be more impartial and make the decision based on the law. We don't believe it is appropriate to allow parents to do this on their own.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Parent(s) should not be allowed to give away their babies without the approval of a judge. Checks must be done on the people who want to adopt the children to make sure they are safe. If the child is born outside of marriage and one of the parents does not want to keep the baby, the judge must make a decision. Parents should not be allowed to give away their babies without the approval of a judge.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of parents being able to give babies away without the approval of a judge.  This would be allowed only if it was in the best interest of the child and the child was placed in the care of a trained professional or support worker who is in the best position to judge whether it is in the child's best interest.  If, however, there was disagreement between the parents, the judge's approval would be required.
