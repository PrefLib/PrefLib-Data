# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - University education should be free. Society is too unfairly balanced and the increasing costs of going to university including tuition fees mean that people from middle and lower income backgrounds no longer have fair access. Education is a good thing, it's good for society and it's good for the economy. The increasing costs of going to university including tuition fees mean that people from middle and lower income backgrounds no longer have fair access. People across all walks of life have a range of skills and intelligence and being born into a wealthy or privileged background should not mean your education should be better than those who have less due to circumstances. Education should be about educating everyone to be a well functioning member of society and there should be no cost to this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - University education should be free for all, as it is an investment in the future of our country. The high fees currently in place are a barrier to people from all walks of life accessing higher education and this is a problem for society as a whole. The current system is also unfair, as it means that people from poorer backgrounds are less likely to go to university, which is a waste of talent and potential. The cost of university should be covered by the government and by business, as it is an investment in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - University education should be free. It is a fundamental right of all people to be able to access the best education possible, and it is the responsibility of the government to ensure this happens. There is no doubt that a university education is an investment in the future of the economy, and the more people who are educated, the more likely it is that the economy will continue to grow. There is also the issue of fairness. People from all walks of life have a range of skills and intelligence, and being born into a wealthy or privileged background should not mean your education should be better than those who have less due to circumstances. Education should be about educating everyone to be a well functioning member of society and there should be no cost to this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - University education should be free. Education is a fundamental human right and should be accessible to everyone. The current system of tuition fees is unfair, as it places the burden of the cost of education on the student, rather than on society as a whole. University is not just a personal investment, but an investment in the future of the country, and the economy. It is also important to note that it is not just about the cost of the education itself, but also the living costs associated with going to university. This means that many people from poorer backgrounds are unable to attend university, as they are unable to support themselves financially. This is unfair, and it is also a waste of the skills and talents of many people.
