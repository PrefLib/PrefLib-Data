# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should be allowed to buy land and give it to the poor. This is because the poor could grow their own crops and be able to be independent in the future. They would not have to rely on the government as much for aid which would save the government money. However, the government would have to be very careful in selecting the land to buy and the people to give it to. They would have to make sure that it would not impact anyone negatively and there would be no repercussions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the decision that the government should not be allowed to buy land and give it to the poor. The reason for this is that it is not fair on the people who have worked hard for their land and also it is unfair on the tax payers who will be funding this. The government should be spending this money on more important things such as food and shelter for the homeless. The government should also not be allowed to do this as it could cause more harm than good. The land could be used to grow crops or to build affordable housing for the poor. This is a much better use of the land and will also benefit the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should be allowed to buy land and give it to the poor, however, the people should be able to prove that they are hardworking and willing to work for what they have.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 -
