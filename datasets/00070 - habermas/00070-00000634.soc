# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Artificial intelligence systems will be programmed to make fair decisions.  However, the decision may not be the fairest if they have not been programmed to deal with all the variables in a situation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Artificial intelligence systems can make fair decisions if they have been trained by a variety of people. They are also able to make fair decisions if they are designed to do so. They are also able to make fair decisions if they are trained on a wide variety of data. They can also make fair decisions if they are designed to learn from their mistakes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, artificial intelligence systems make fair decisions, however there are some exceptions.  In the cases where humans have programmed the systems with their own bias, the decisions will not be fair.  It is also possible that a system will learn from its mistakes and make decisions based on past experience, and these may not be fair.  In most cases, however, artificial intelligence systems will make fair decisions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the decisions made by artificial intelligence are fair.  They are based on what they have been taught and the information that they have been given.  They are able to look at all of the information available and come to a decision based on this.
