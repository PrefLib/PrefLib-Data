# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I believe the UK is better for having a monarchy.  The royal family bring in a lot of public interest to this country, a lot of financial interest also.  Our country has a lot of history and it is something most of the UK are proud of I believe.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I think it's good to have both. The monarchy is a part of history so should still be a part of our society. But a republic is needed so everyone is heard. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is better to have a republic. Nobody should be given the influence and wealth that comes with monarchy simply as a result of birth. The state should have representatives who have worked to achieve their position.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think there is tradition in keeping a monarcy and I do like how things are now with UK where it does have a constitutional monarchy and also elected representatives. I do like a republic system way of doing things as well. Societies do better when there is more equality and less people in power at the top controlling things. The monarchy cost the UK a lot of money too, so some say it is unecessary, but I think they do add some value in their roles and bring a sense of community to the people. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - Honestly, I think that it is better to have a monarchy- but without much political power. I think the Royals bring in a lot of tourism and help out the British Economy with bringing in lots of money. I heard that some of the royals bring in nearly a few billions every year by their influence. But I do not think that they should be able to have the right to use tax payer money so easily, such as the grand royal weddings. However, I do recognize that some of them do represent out country well, internationally. But also on the flip side, the current public situation with a few royals doesn't hold well with me. I think that in conclusion that a republic with be the best idea, so that everyone has a voice and are equal.
