# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of having to carry national identification. They felt that this was an infringement on personal liberties and that it was not necessary in the majority of cases. They did agree that it would be useful in certain situations, such as when dealing with the police or in a nightclub, but they felt that this was not a sufficient reason to have to carry it all the time. They felt that it was not necessary to carry national identification in order to prove who you are, as most people would be able to recognise you from your face.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should not be required to carry national identification on their person at all times.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We are all fairly undecided on this question. On the one hand, it is important to carry identification on your person at all times so that if you are stopped by the police or something happens to you in an emergency, you have a way of proving who you are. On the other hand, I do not believe that you should have to carry identification with you at all times, especially if you are just going about your daily business, going shopping, etc. I do think, however, that there should be some kind of database of people in Ireland and it should be free for people to access their own information. This would allow the police or other emergency services to check someone's identity without them having to carry it on their person.
