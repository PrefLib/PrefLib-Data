# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the Royal family is a net positive for society. Although they are very expensive to maintain, they do provide a great deal of income to the UK through tourism. They are also a very important part of the culture and history of the UK and it would be difficult to imagine the UK without them. However, there is a strong argument to suggest that the Royal family is not a net positive for society. The Royal family is very expensive to maintain and the UK is in a difficult financial situation. It is also difficult to see how the Royal family benefits society as a whole, as they are only a benefit to a select few.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the Royal family is a net positive for society. It is difficult to put a monetary value on the cultural impact that the Royal family has on society. The Royal family is a big part of British culture and has been for many years. It is difficult to imagine Britain without the Royal family. It is also difficult to imagine Britain without the Royal family as it would be difficult to replace the income that they generate through tourism. It is also difficult to replace the cultural impact that the Royal family has on society. The Royal family also helps to promote the UK on an international stage and is a source of national pride for many people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The royal family is a net positive for society. This is because they are a large part of our culture and history, and have been for many generations. This means that the royal family is ingrained into our society, and will be for many more generations to come. Although there are some negatives to the royal family, such as the costs of upkeep and the recent scandals, we believe that these are outweighed by the positives. The royal family brings in a lot of money to the country through tourism, and they also provide a sense of national pride. We believe that the royal family will continue to be a net positive for society in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the Royal family is a net positive for society. This is because they bring in a large amount of tourism to the UK and they are also a large part of our culture and heritage. They are also a symbol of unity for the country, and are a source of pride for many people. However, there are some negatives to the Royal family. The large amount of money they receive from the government is a large amount of money that could be spent on other things. Also, some of the things they have said and done in the past have been very controversial, and this has damaged the reputation of the Royal family.
