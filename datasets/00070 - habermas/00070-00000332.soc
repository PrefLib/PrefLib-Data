# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The NHS is the best health service in the world, and has been a cornerstone of the British way of life for the last seventy years. The way the NHS has managed to achieve this with only minimal tax contributions from its citizens is remarkable. However, in recent years, the NHS has been in crisis, with long waiting lists, underpaid and overworked staff, and increasingly outdated facilities. If we are to ensure the continued existence of the NHS, we need to address this crisis. This should be done by increasing the proportion of our taxes that goes towards the NHS, as this is the most efficient way to fund it. I think that the majority of the British people would be willing to pay slightly more tax to save the NHS, which I think is the most important thing that our taxes should go towards. If we do not find a way to address the crisis, I fear that the NHS will not be around in another seventy years to provide such an excellent level of care. We will have lost the most wonderful thing the UK has ever given to the world, and this would be an absolute travesty.

I think that the majority of the British people would be willing to pay slightly more tax to save the NHS, which I think is the most important thing that our taxes should go towards. As the rich already pay the least proportion of their income in tax of any group in society, I believe that the extra money required to save the NHS should come from them. I also think that the level of tax for corporations should be increased to help save the NHS.”

I think that the majority of the British people would be willing to pay slightly more tax to save the NHS, which I think is the most important thing that our taxes should go towards. This should be done by taxing the rich, as they can most afford it, rather than the poorer classes who are already struggling to make ends meet financially.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The NHS is the best health service in the world, and has been a cornerstone of the British way of life for the last seventy years. The way the NHS has managed to achieve this with only minimal tax contributions from its citizens is remarkable.

I think that the majority of the British people would be willing to pay slightly more tax to save the NHS, which I think is the most important thing that our taxes should go towards. This increase in taxes should be spread as evenly as possible, but the brunt of it should be borne by the richest and corporations, who are better able to afford it.” Discussion: We found this exercise to be really helpful in developing a consensus opinion. It started with a discussion on the question, and then moved onto writing down individual opinions. We then discussed these opinions, and the first draft of the consensus statement was
