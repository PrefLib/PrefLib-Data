# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The police should have the power to use facial recognition technology to search for suspects. The advances in technology should be utilised for the greater good, and it seems that this would be a good way to identify criminals in cases where suspects can be wrongly identified or to facilitate these searches. Often criminals get away with the crimes they committed, so by using this technology it could quite easily widen the number of people that can be identified. I'm sure with machine learning algorithms these systems can detect individuals quite accurately, meaning it's likely a good way to identify suspects. With the assistance of humans it's likely that even in cases where people are wrongly selected initially, they will not be wrongly brought to the system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Facial recognition technology can be an important tool in the fight against crime. Cameras are in place throughout our cities and towns and being able to access the information they provide is essential to track the whereabouts of criminals. Some may feel there is an issue in regards to privacy but I think the cameras are already filming so why not make use of them. The give police extra eyes as they cannot be in all places at once. However, there is a concern that this technology will infringe people's human rights . We do not want to live in a Police State and this technology may be one further step towards this. The technology is not perfect and there is a risk that people will be wrongly identified. It is therefore important that the police are not able to use this technology in an arbitrary way. It should be used only when there is a clear and present danger to the public and the police have a reasonable belief that the person is a suspect. The police should be required to provide a justification for their use of the technology and the use should be reviewed by an independent body.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Facial recognition software is a useful tool for the police to use to identify suspects. It can be used to identify people who commit crimes and can be used in conjunction with other forms of surveillance to track suspects. It is a non-invasive way to track people and can be used to protect law-abiding citizens. However, there are concerns that it could be misused and that it could be used to infringe on people's human rights. The police should only be allowed to use this technology in very specific circumstances and there should be a robust system in place to ensure that it is not misused.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the decision that the police should be allowed to use facial recognition technology to search for suspects. We believe that this is a useful tool for the police to use, as it can help to identify criminals and help to prevent crime. We believe that the police should not have unfettered access to this technology, as this could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Instead, we believe that the police should be required to obtain a warrant before they can use this technology. This will ensure that the police do not abuse this power, and will also ensure that the police are only using this technology in the cases where it is most needed.
