# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have a moral responsibility to give aid to the poor wherever they are, because we are all global citizens and are responsible for each other.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There is no moral obligation to give aid to the poor abroad, but we have a moral responsibility as global citizens to help the poor. This was a difficult process, and we were pushed to our limits, but it was also a very rewarding experience.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is a moral responsibility for wealthier, more developed countries to give aid to the poor abroad. The people of the world are all human beings and we are all interconnected. As global citizens we have a moral responsibility to help other people around the world, especially those in poverty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although there is no moral obligation to give aid to the poor abroad, we have a moral responsibility as global citizens to give aid to the poor.
