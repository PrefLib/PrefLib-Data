# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we do not think employers should be allowed to ask for job applicants credit score. While it is a good indication of an applicants financial capability, we feel that it could be unfair to those with poor credit scores who may be a good applicant for the role.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, we do not think employers should be allowed to ask for job applicants credit score. While it is a good indication of an applicants financial capability, it could be unfair to those with poor credit scores who may be a good applicant for the role. It is also unnecessary as there are other ways to confirm an applicants identity. (c)  The above is a fictional scenario, and the opinions, critiques, and final consensus statement are not those of the participants.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We don't believe that employers should be allowed to ask job applicants for their credit score. It may be a good indication of their financial capability, but not of their suitability for the role. This is a very private piece of information, and although consent would need to be given, it would not make it any less intrusive. There are less intrusive ways to verify the identity of an applicant, such as a passport, so it would not be necessary to request a credit score.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we do not think employers should be allowed to ask for job applicants credit score. While it is a good indication of an applicants financial capability, we feel that it could be unfair to those with poor credit scores who may be a good applicant for the role. The employer may also obtain this information in order to discriminate against job applicants.
