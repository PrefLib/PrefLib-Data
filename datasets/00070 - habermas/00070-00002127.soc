# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It was agreed by the group that the high national debt level of the UK is a cause for concern for many reasons, one of which is the rising cost of living. The increase in prices of basic necessities such as food and petrol is a result of the Government printing out more money in order to keep the country going, in turn devaluing the value of the money. This affects individuals on lower incomes as they have to pay a higher percentage of their salary for basic living costs. This is an unfair increase on their standards of living.

This is because they do not have enough money to spend, and are most likely to have large amounts of debt. The group of participants also agreed that it is the Government’s responsibility to protect the interests of all citizens in the country, and this is not being done.
