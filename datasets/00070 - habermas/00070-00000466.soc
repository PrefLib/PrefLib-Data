# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should increase the amount of solar energy produced in the UK. This is a key issue as solar energy is a clean, renewable energy source that is currently under-used in the UK. This is a major issue as we are all suffering from the consequences of climate change, including increased storms and droughts, as well as increased energy bills as we are reliant on non-renewable energy sources. Solar energy can be produced in the UK with the help of government initiatives that incentivise energy producers to switch to renewable energy sources, including, but not limited to, solar energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, we believe that the government should increase the amount of solar energy produced in the UK. We believe this is important because solar energy is one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy, and can be easily generated in the UK. We believe that increasing the amount of solar energy produced in the UK will help the government meet its climate change targets, and reduce the UK's reliance on foreign sources of energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing the amount of solar energy produced in the UK. Some concerns were raised, however, such as the difficulty of large scale energy production using solar energy, and the dangers of solar energy if not implemented properly. The group in general felt that solar energy is a promising alternative to the conventional forms of energy production, and a renewable source that would help to reduce our impact on the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group believes that the government should work to increase the amount of solar energy produced in the UK. This is an important issue as solar energy is one of the best alternatives to oil and gas, which we urgently need to replace to tackle climate change. Solar energy can be produced in the UK with the help of government initiatives that incentivise energy producers to switch to renewable energy sources, including, but not limited to, solar energy.
