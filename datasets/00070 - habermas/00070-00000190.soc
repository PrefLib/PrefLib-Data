# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Scotland will probably be independent in the future but this will only be because of political campaigning. We are living in a very unpredictable time and Brexit will impact this decision a lot.”

A resurgence in the independence movement cannot be ruled out, especially with the SNP at the helm of the Scottish Parliament, and if the Conservative Party are forced to rely on a deal with the SNP to stay in power, it would be in the interests of the SNP to take their own seats back.
