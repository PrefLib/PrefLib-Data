# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Prime Minister Tony Blair was not right to take the UK into the Iraq War. There was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction and the decision to go to war was based on flawed intelligence. The decision to go to war destabilised Iraq and the region, and has led to a rise in Muslim extremism. The decision has weakened the UK's credibility and the UK has paid the price since.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The Iraq war was launched by the UK and US under the premiss of 'liberating' the Iraqi people from a dictator who was likely to use weapons of mass destruction on the allies. We now know that this information was either flawed or deliberately misleading and that no weapons of mass destruction were found. The war has destabilised Iraq, costed a great deal of money and lives and has increased the risk of terrorist attack against western targets. While it may have been the right thing to do at the time, with the information we have now, we believe that Tony Blair should not have launched the Iraq war.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was against the decision to take the UK into war in Iraq. The decision was based on the presence of weapons of mass destruction which were later proven not to exist. The decision was also based on the belief that Iraq had a hand in the 9/11 attacks which was later proven not to be the case. The decision also resulted in the destabilisation of Iraq and the rise of Muslim extremism. The decision also weakened the UK's credibility in the eyes of the world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although Prime Minister Blair was acting on the information he had at the time, he wasn't right to take the UK into the Iraq war. His decision resulted in the destablisation of Iraq and a rise in Muslim extremism. The war weakened the UK's credibility and we have paid the price since.
