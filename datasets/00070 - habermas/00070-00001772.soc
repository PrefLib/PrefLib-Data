# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not build a nuclear power station on each of the islands of the UK. While nuclear energy may be one of the most environmentally friendly forms of energy generation, there are several reasons why building a nuclear power station on every island would not be a good idea. Firstly, it would be impractical and too expensive to build a power station on every island in the UK, and the expense of doing so would make it not financially viable. Secondly, even though the UK is an island itself, most of the population and energy use is concentrated in a few large cities, which means that a nuclear power station on the mainland would be much more efficient than one on one of the islands. Finally, many of the islands are too small to have the space required for a power station, and the environmental impact on the local population would be too great to justify building one. The group also considered that there are better options than nuclear power generation. It is important that the UK looks to renewable energy for future power generation, as well as new, more efficient energy technologies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We do not believe that a nuclear power station should be built on each of the islands of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, we do not think that nuclear power stations should be built on each of the islands of the UK.  We think that this would be an unnecessary expense and would cause more problems than it would solve.  We do think that nuclear power is an important part of the UK's energy mix and that more nuclear power stations should be built.  However, we do not think that it is necessary to build a nuclear power station on each of the islands of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of building a nuclear power station on each of the islands of the UK. The group felt that the UK should be looking to increase its capacity for generating nuclear energy, but that this should not be at the expense of other forms of renewable energy. The group felt that it was important to site nuclear power stations in locations that will be safe for a long time, and that many of the UK's islands are going to be vulnerable as climate change leads to rising sea levels and extreme weather events. The group also felt that the energy generated will need to be transported to where it is needed, which will mostly be on the mainland, and that it would not be ideal to build nuclear power stations on each of the islands of the UK.
