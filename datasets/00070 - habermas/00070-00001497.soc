# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the testing of new drugs and research on non-human animals is ethical. However, it is important that the testing is done in the most humane way possible. The animals should not be subjected to unnecessary pain or suffering, and if there is a possibility that the testing could result in the death of the animal, it should not be done. The testing of new drugs and research on non-human animals is necessary to ensure that the new drugs and research are safe for humans, and so that we can continue to develop new drugs and research that will help to save human lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the testing of animals for the development of medicines for humans is ethical. The testing of animals for the development of medicines for humans is ethical because it is necessary to test on animals before testing on humans. The testing of animals for the development of medicines for humans is ethical because the life of a human is more valuable than the life of an animal. The testing of animals for the development of medicines for humans is ethical because it is necessary to test on animals before testing on humans.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Ethics is a complex and multifaceted subject, however, we believe that there is a need for animal testing in the development of new medicines. There is no alternative testing method that is able to match the extensive range of information that is gained through animal testing. Animal testing helps us to learn about human physiology and pathology and has been fundamental to the development of the vast majority of treatments that are available today. Although there is an ethical burden to the lives that are lost, it is a necessary step in the process of improving the lives of humans.
