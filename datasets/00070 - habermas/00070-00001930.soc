# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the use of animals in medical research is morally right. However, it is important to ensure that the animals are treated ethically and with respect. The animals should not be harmed or mistreated in any way and should be cared for in a humane manner. The use of animals in medical research is important to ensure that new drugs and treatments are safe for humans. The use of animals in medical research should be tightly regulated and there should be strict rules in place to ensure that the animals are not harmed or mistreated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is not morally right to use animals in medical research because there are now a number of alternatives that should be explored.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the conclusion that it is morally right to use animals in medical research, but with some very strict conditions. The animals should be treated with the utmost respect and should not be harmed in any way. They should be kept in the best conditions possible and should not be harmed in any way. The animals should be bred specifically for this purpose and should not be taken from the wild. The animals should not be harmed in any way and should not be given any permanent damage.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “I feel that the use of animals in medical research is a very debatable subject, with many valid arguments on both sides.  There are obvious advantages to this practice, in terms of testing drugs before humans can use them, to prevent harm and damage to humans.  However, it is also very important to treat animals humanely and ensure that animals are not placed in situations that cause them harm and distress.  There are many ways to treat animals humanely, whilst ensuring the best outcomes for medical research.  Therefore, although there are many advantages to the use of animals in medical research, it is also very important to ensure that the welfare of the animals is of high priority.”
