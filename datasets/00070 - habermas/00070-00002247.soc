# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Austerity is a bad policy for the UK. The effects of austerity are felt most by the poorer members of society. Austerity policies are also likely to have a negative impact on the economy in the long term. The effects of austerity policies are also likely to be felt by the wealthier members of society in the long term. Austerity policies are likely to lead to a reduction in the quality of life for everyone in the UK. Austerity policies are also likely to lead to an increase in crime in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Austerity is not a good economic policy for the UK. It is an unfair policy that will impact the poorer members of society the most. It is not an effective way to reduce the deficit as it will lead to a decrease in GDP. It will also lead to an increase in unemployment and a decrease in productivity. It will also lead to an increase in crime and a decrease in the quality of life. It will lead to a decrease in the quality of education and health. It is not a good policy for the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We do not think austerity is a good economic policy for the UK. Austerity is the practice of a government reducing its spending and borrowing to fight against an economic recession. The UK is currently going through austerity and it is impacting many families and public services. A policy of austerity is not very effective in tackling the economic crisis as it affects the poorer members of society the most and these are the people who spend most of their income in the UK economy. Austerity only reduces inflation but in the long term this results in less spending in the economy and less jobs, and therefore results in less economic growth. Austerity only works in countries where there is not much disparity in the wealth of its people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Austerity is not a good economic policy for the UK. This is because although there are cuts, these are being made in the wrong places. The cuts are being made in public services which actually need money. For example, cutting money from the NHS, which is already struggling and needs more money, is detrimental to our society. Moreover, these cuts are negatively affecting the poorer members of our society. It is having a bigger impact on the lower classes and making the already unequal society even more unequal. The questions was posed in the following week and we saw the following consensus statement: Austerity is a good economic policy for the UK as long as the spending cuts are made in the right areas. For example, spending cuts should not be made in the NHS or on teachers, as this would affect the public most and lead to lower productivity. Instead, cuts should be made in areas where it will have the least effect on people.
