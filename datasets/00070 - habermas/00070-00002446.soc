# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we should not have a maximum wage to ensure that footballers do not earn more than the Prime Minister. The role of Prime Minister is an important one, yes, but the benefits they get for having this role last a lifetime. The salary of footballers should not be capped, as it depends on their unique skills and demand. Market forces should determine salary. A maximum wage is unfair as it reduces people's earning power. Many footballers earn a crazy amount of money, however, that's the nature of the game. When they retire from the sport, they don't have a guaranteed income or pension.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Footballers should be paid what the market dictates. A maximum wage is not necessary as footballers should be allowed to make as much money as they can.

Footballers should be allowed to make as much money as they can as long as they are paying their taxes.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should not be a maximum wage for footballers as this is a free market and the salaries of footballers are dependent on the skills of the individual and the demand for them. The Prime Minister on the other hand has a maximum wage that is determined by parliament. The salary of the Prime Minister should be increased to reflect the responsibilities of the role. This was then debated by the whole group who came to a consensus view as follows: The salary of the Prime Minister should be increased to reflect the responsibilities of the role. This should be done through a pay review by an independent body.
