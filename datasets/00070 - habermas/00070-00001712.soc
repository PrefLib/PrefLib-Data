# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group of participants generally agreed that the UK should remain as it is, but with the devolution of power to the constituent countries of the UK in certain areas.  It was recognised that the countries of the UK could work more closely together in areas such as trade and defence.  This would allow the UK to remain a strong and united force in the world.  However, it was also recognised that the devolution of power to the constituent countries of the UK would be beneficial in some areas.  For example, in education, each country could develop its own curriculum and qualifications, which would be more suited to the needs of the people in that country.  This would allow for greater flexibility and innovation.  However, it was also recognised that the devolution of power to the constituent countries of the UK could also lead to greater confusion and problems.  For example, if each country had its own curriculum, it could be problematic when students from different countries apply to the same university course, and have to be judged on different qualifications.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The countries of the UK should remain as they are, but with more devolved powers.  For example, in education, each country could have its own curriculum and qualifications, which would be more suited to the needs of the people in that country.  However, it is important that the countries of the UK continue to work closely together in areas such as trade and defence.  This would allow the UK to remain a strong and united force in the world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of the UK remaining as it is.  However, it was recognised that there are some areas where the devolution of power to the constituent countries of the UK would be beneficial.  For example, in education, each country could develop its own curriculum and qualifications, which would be more suited to the needs of the people in that country.  This would allow for greater flexibility and innovation.  It was also recognised that the countries of the UK could work more closely together in areas such as trade and defence.  This would allow the UK to remain a strong and united force in the world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: Each country in the UK has its own distinct history, culture and set of traditions, and it would be good if each could have more control over its own affairs. In particular, each should be allowed to take charge of education in its own country and could focus on developing its own unique curriculum and qualifications, which would be more suited to the needs of the people in that country.  However, it would also be beneficial to the UK as a whole if the separate countries could work more closely together in areas such as trade and defence.  This would allow the UK to remain a strong and united force in the world. Participant feedback: We had one of our working days in mid February 2020 focusing on feedback, involving 18 group participants.  Feedback on how the case study had been presented to participants by the facilitator and other co-ordinators: Participants were asked how their case study session had been organised, and how the material and resources provided had helped their understanding of issues and exploration of the question. They had been provided with a sheet of paper listing ten other case study questions, and were asked to try and predict what the group of participants who received that question had focused on as key issues.
