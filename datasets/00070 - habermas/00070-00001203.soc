# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Manchester United is a worse football team than Liverpool, evident by the Premier League standings, along with Liverpool's recent treble cup win. Liverpool has been managed in a much better way than Manchester United, which has resulted in a much more efficient team and player signings. Despite Manchester United being considered a better team historically, they have been poorly managed recently, which is supported by the Glazer family wanting to sell the team to a new owner. Thus, Liverpool is the better football team.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “There are many football teams in the world, and even more in England. However, Liverpool and Manchester United have a long and rich history, which means it is not possible to answer this question without considering their past as well as their present. To this end, we came to the following consensus:” “Manchester United has a history of being a good team, as well as a history of being an over-rated and over-priced team, while Liverpool has a history of being a good team, as well as a history of being an over-rated and over-priced team. Both teams have failed in recent years to be a top team in the league, which we believe is a direct result of their recent success. In conclusion, we feel that the recent success of the Liverpool team in the Premiership, Champions League and FA Cup has caused a positive shift in their performance, which we believe will lead to a better future for Liverpool, as opposed to Manchester United, who, despite a better history and more money than Liverpool, have been an abysmal failure recently.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Manchester United is a better football team than Liverpool.  The group came to this conclusion because of the recent performance of both teams, and the recent performance of Liverpool was much worse than Manchester United.  The group also took into account the historical performance of both teams, and concluded that Manchester United has been a better team in the past as well.  The group did not take into account the recent managerial changes of the two teams, because the group believes that a manager can only do so much to improve the performance of the team.  The group also did not take into account the Glazer family's ownership of Manchester United, because the group believes that the ownership of the team is irrelevant to the performance of the team.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is Manchester United.
