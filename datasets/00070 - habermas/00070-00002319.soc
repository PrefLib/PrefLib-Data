# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “We should not abolish private property as generational wealth is important in this country. It provides an incentive to work harder and longer, if you believe your earnings will be passed on to loved ones. Abolishing private property will lead toward Socialism/Communism, and historically those countries have not fared well in the long term. If there is little incentive to work, then the society will be less productive. However, there should be more access to affordable housing so that most sections of the population have the opportunity to buy their own home. Having bought a modest home, it should be up to the homeowner whether any of this wealth can be accumulated intergenerationally. There should be a limit on intergenerational wealth to stop the 1% getting richer and richer. It would help with the rich-poor divide.”

Abolishing private property will lead toward Socialism/Communism, and historically those countries have not fared well in the long term. If there is little incentive to work, then the society will be less productive. However, we should be looking to increase the supply of affordable housing so that most sections of the population have the opportunity to buy their own home. This would be a more equitable way of increasing intergenerational wealth than the current system, where many people will never be able to afford to buy their own home.”
