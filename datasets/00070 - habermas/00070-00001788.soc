# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There are pros and cons to the implementation of a Universal Basic Income in the UK. We think that it would be beneficial to evaluate the experiments that are running in Finland and the Netherlands and get more information on how the scheme works and how it can be implemented in the UK. We would also like to ensure that the implementation of such a scheme is done so with an ethical code of conduct so that it doesn't lead to people falling into poverty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK should consider adopting a similar approach to the Universal Basic Income experiments that are currently running in Finland and the Netherlands, however only after investigating the successes and failures of these pilot schemes in these countries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We think that the UK should consider adopting a similar approach to the Universal Basic Income experiments that are currently running in Finland and the Netherlands. The rising cost of living is putting many people in poverty and struggling to meet their basic needs, and with automation of jobs, people are losing their jobs and means of income. A Universal Basic Income is one way of ensuring that all people, whether in work or out of work, can access the funds to ensure their basic needs are met. There are many benefits to this, such as increased quality of life, a reduced strain on the NHS and welfare services, and an increase in productivity and economic growth. We do think that more information on how the scheme works in these countries would be useful before making a decision. We would also like to ensure that the implementation of such a scheme is done so with an ethical code of conduct so that it doesn't lead to people falling into poverty, and so that benefits are accessible and adequate for everyone.

We also think that the scheme should be introduced on a trial basis, with close monitoring to ensure that the desired benefits are being realised.
