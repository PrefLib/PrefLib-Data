# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is no difference between the two, they seem to do the same job with the same duties.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is the opinion of the group that the answer to the question would be yes, having a President would be better than having a Prime Minister. The group came to this decision as a President would hold the highest office in the land and would be voted into that position directly by the people. A President would also be the direct representative of the people. On the other hand, a Prime Minister is only appointed to his position by a monarch who may be a foreigner or a relative. In the case of the latter, he would not be the people's direct representative.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the Prime Minister is the most senior politician in the cabinet and the government. The Prime Minister can be referred to as Head of Government or Head of the Cabinet. The President is the ceremonial head of the state and usually has no political role or power. The President is often seen as a representative of the country. It would be better to have a Prime Minister as they would be responsible for ensuring that the laws are implemented and governing the country. The President would also need to act within the law as created by the Prime Minister. This would mean that there is one main individual with overall power and responsibility for governing the country. The Prime Minister would be better suited to this task.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In conclusion, while we don't feel that either option would be superior to the other, it is more important to look at the constitution of the country which will indicate what system of governance is in place. As long as rule of law is followed, it will have no impact on the state of the country.
