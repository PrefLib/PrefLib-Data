# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the budget for both health care and education. In particular, the group emphasised the role of health care as a public good, which has a high positive impact on the overall welfare of the nation. The consensus view of the group was that if we spend more on healthcare then people will have a longer, healthier life, which will make the country as a whole more productive. In other words, the group concluded that there is a virtuous circle, where the investment in healthcare leads to the improvement in economic growth and welfare.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Money should be spent on both healthcare and education. The health of the population is very important for the well being of the economy. The economy relies on people being able to work and to produce goods and services. A healthy workforce is therefore essential for the economy. The economy also needs to be well educated. A good education system will enable the economy to produce a workforce that is equipped with the skills that are needed to produce goods and services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Healthcare is an important public service, however education is also very important. The current generation of staff are struggling with Covid and will be working for a long time to come. It is essential to spend more money on healthcare so that staff are supported and the NHS can deliver the highest level of care. More money needs to be spent on education. Education needs to be enhanced with the use of technology to improve teaching and assessment methods. More money also needs to be spent on developing public transport and improving the railways. Spending more on these areas will have a positive impact on the nation”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be more money spent on education as well as healthcare.  It was also felt that more money should be spent on staff pay and health services so that staff are attracted and retained.
