# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the UK does have an obesity problem.  The reasons for this are complex and include a change in eating habits, more sedentary lifestyles, and the ready availability of cheap, unhealthy food.  The problem is compounded by the fact that obesity is a self-perpetuating problem, in that obese people are more likely to become obese and obese children are more likely to become obese adults.  The problem is also made worse by the ready availability of bariatric surgery, which is seen as a quick fix, rather than addressing the root causes of obesity.  In order to combat obesity, the government needs to provide better education about healthy eating and the importance of exercise.  It also needs to provide incentives to make healthy food more affordable and to discourage the consumption of unhealthy food.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK does have an obesity problem. The increase in obesity related illnesses is a direct result of this. The issue is being compounded by the availability of cheap, unhealthy food and a more sedentary lifestyle. The problem needs to be addressed at its root, by encouraging cookery classes in schools again and teaching nutrition.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The uk does have a problem with obesity. we need to encourage cooking from scratch and allow schools to teach children the importance of a healthy diet and exercise.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK does have an obesity problem. A very big problem! It's well known that it is costing the NHS millions of pounds a year due to obesity related illnesses. The government are providing free healthy snacks and meals to all children up to year 2 in school. The prices of ready meals and processed foods are so cheap and this needs to be addressed. People need to get back to basics and learn to cook meals from scratch, using fresh ingredients. This way, you know exactly what is going into your food. There is so much conflicting information out there about what you should and shouldn't be eating. A lot of the information we see is sponsored by food and drink companies. That is why it's so important to read the labels. I think we should be more like Italy where there is no 'junk food' advertised on TV or in shops. Unless you are in a certain area of a supermarket, you are only presented with fresh fruit and veg. We need to be more like this.
