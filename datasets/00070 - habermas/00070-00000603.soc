# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK's approach to the EU has been wrong, with a victory for the leave campaign being used as a mandate for the Conservative government to pursue a hard Brexit. This has led to a hard border in Northern Ireland, increased bureaucracy for businesses and reduced trade with the EU. The UK has also lost its seat at the table on important world issues and been left with little power on the world stage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There has been some major issues that have arisen from Brexit and some of these have been caused by Boris Johnson. The UK has not done the best job of negotiating its departure from the EU and this has led to a number of problems. The UK leaving the EU has reduced our trade with important European markets and caused political as well as economic hardship in Northern Ireland with its hard border with the EU. Not being in the EU has reduced our global standing to that of a bystander on the world stage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In hindsight, the UK's approach to the EU has been wrong. The referendum was called on false premises and the result has been more problems for the UK and a lot of economic and political uncertainty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the UK's approach to the EU is wrong. In general, the UK's approach to the EU is wrong. In general, the UK's approach to the EU is wrong. In general, the UK's approach to the EU is wrong. In general, the UK's approach to the EU is wrong.
