# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that we should not ban cars in central London, but instead provide incentives to reduce their usage, and introduce more stringent regulations and standards for vehicles allowed into the centre of London, so that we can reduce pollution.  We should ensure that taxis, emergency services and other necessary vehicles continue to be allowed into central London, so long as they conform to the new regulations and standards.  We believe that incentivising the use of public transport, and improving public transport links to central London is an important component of this, and that the high-levels of footfall in the centre of London should help to drive down the number of people driving in their own vehicles.  We believe that a more stringent vetting process for vehicles being used in central London is a better approach, rather than an outright ban on cars, which would simply cause resentment.  We also believe that any changes to regulations should be made in consultation with a range of affected groups, so that we can ensure that those most affected by the changes have a say in them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that there are specific business and essential services, taxis, ambulances and other vehicles that need to access Central London which will be very strongly impacted by a ban, and therefore we should instead incentivise individuals to reduce their car use, and ensure that strict regulations for vehicles operating in central London are implemented to ensure that vehicles conform to those regulations.  We believe that local businesses would benefit from increased footfall, and that households would benefit from increased customer spend in London generally from customers travelling by public transport into Central London.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that we should not ban cars in central London, but instead provide incentives to reduce their usage, and introduce more stringent regulations and standards for vehicles allowed into the centre of London, so that we can reduce pollution.  We should ensure that taxis, emergency services and other necessary vehicles continue to be allowed into central London, so long as they conform to the new regulations and standards.  We believe that incentivising the use of public transport, and improving public transport links to central London is an important component of this, and that this is the most politically-palatable way forward - high-levels of footfall in the centre of London should help to drive down the number of people driving in their own vehicles, as should penalties for road-users.  We believe that new regulations and standards should be produced in consultation with residents, and any impact on those with low incomes should be borne in mind when considering rules around what vehicles are allowable in central London.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that we should not ban cars in central London, but instead provide incentives to reduce their usage, and introduce more stringent regulations and standards for vehicles allowed into the centre of London, so that we can reduce pollution.  We should ensure that taxis, emergency services and other necessary vehicles continue to be allowed into central London, so long as they conform to the new regulations and standards.  We believe that incentivising the use of public transport, and improving public transport links to central London is an important component of this, and that the high-levels of footfall in the centre of London should help to drive down the number of people driving in their own vehicles.  We believe that a more stringent vetting process for vehicles being used in central London is a better approach, rather than an outright ban on cars, which would simply cause resentment.  We believe that car owners should be incentivised to buy and use electric cars, as this will reduce pollution, and that there should be a higher cost for non-electric cars, so that the cost of owning an electric car is comparable to that of owning a non-electric car.  Finally, we believe that a policy of encouraging and incentivising the use of public transport
