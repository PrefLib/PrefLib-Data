# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: School exams provide an objective assessment of students' learning. They cannot be too difficult as students from poorer educational backgrounds may not be able to access the curriculum. The exams are set at an appropriate level to ensure they are neither too difficult nor too easy. They are designed to be challenging, not for students to only know the answers but to test that they know and understand the concepts behind the answers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Most school exams are not too easy. There is a need to ensure that all students are able to access the curriculum and the exams are the best way of assessing this. Therefore, the exams cannot be too difficult as this would mean that some students would not be able to access the curriculum and would not be able to demonstrate their learning. There is also a need to ensure that the exams are challenging enough to assess the students and to ensure that they are being stretched to their full potential. Therefore, the exams cannot be too easy as this would mean that the students are not being stretched to their full potential. The exams are set at a level that is appropriate for the students.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Some school exams are too easy for some students and some school exams are too difficult for some students. The answer lies in more appropriate exams and I think some research needs to be done into this so that exams can be made more suitable for different students.
