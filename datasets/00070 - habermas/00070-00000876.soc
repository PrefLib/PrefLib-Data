# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the government should not spend all of the money on education on people under the age of 18. There are many other things that need to be invested in, such as the health sector and the economy. It is important that the government does not spend all of its money on one sector, as this could lead to the other sectors being neglected. The government should also invest in adults, as this would be beneficial to the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, the government should not spend all of the money it spends on education on people under the age of 18. There are many adults who would like to further their education and the government should be able to provide this for them. Also, there are many adults who are interested in gaining more qualifications. The government should be able to provide this for them. However, there are many costs involved in providing education for adults and resources are limited.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, the government should not spend all of its money on education on people under the age of 18. The government should spend money on all ages, however, it should be spent on children and young people more, as they are the future. The government should invest in education for all ages and for all people. It should be spent on children and young people to help them in the future. It should be spent on adults to help them get jobs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, not all of the money the government spends on education should be spent on people under the age of 18. Whilst it is important to invest in children and young people to help us in the future, it is also important to invest in adults. Many adults would love the chance to gain more qualifications. However, the cost limits gaining more education and also resources. The government doesn't invest in many educational services above 18 years so it would be good in future to see them implement this. It would be good for adults and people of all ages to gain more skills and more qualifications for jobs.
