# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be restrictions on the age at which children can enter a nightclub. Teenagers, especially those younger than 16, are still developing their decision-making skills and are not fully able to give informed consent to actions. Furthermore, their exposure to the adult-oriented activities that are performed in nightclubs could be harmful to their health and well-being. We would propose that there should be an age limit of 18, however we are willing to concede that perhaps 16 and 17 year olds could be allowed into nightclubs with an adult relative. However, there would be a need for further controls to be put in place to ensure that the 16 and 17 year olds are not at risk from drugs or alcohol consumption.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Nightclubs should be 18+ only spaces. The risk of exposure to activities that are potentially harmful and that children are not yet able to make informed choices about are too great. We believe this is the best way to protect minors.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be restrictions on what age children can enter a nightclub. We need to be clear that by "children" we are referring to those under 18s, and that the discussion refers to nightclubs in the UK. We would agree that there should be restrictions on what age children can enter a nightclub. Teenagers, especially those younger than 16, are still developing their decision-making skills and are not fully able to give informed consent to actions. Furthermore, their exposure to the adult-oriented activities that are performed in nightclubs could be harmful to their health and well-being. We would propose that there should be an age limit of 18, however we are willing to concede that perhaps 16 and 17 year olds could be allowed into nightclubs with an adult relative. However, we have also considered the points raised by others in their critiques and we would like to include a note of caution. We have concerns that allowing children of these ages into nightclubs will increase the potential risks, as they would still be susceptible to the peer pressure to consume alcohol or take drugs.
