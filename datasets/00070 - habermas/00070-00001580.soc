# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, the group of participants believe that we should have a Universal Basic Income. This is because it would be fair to everyone in the society and not favour some people over others. It would also ensure that everyone is happy and treated in the same way as one another. The group of participants also believe that it would create money in the economy because everyone would have more money to spend so their mental health would improve. Everyone will be on the same rate and its best for everyone. There is a hope that this would create money in the economy. However, it is difficult to know until the scheme has actually been set up and seen how it goes.

The group of participants also believe that it would create money in the economy because everyone would have more money to spend so their mental health would improve. Everyone will be on the same rate and its best for everyone. The discussion method, as demonstrated above, worked well, and I would have preferred to keep this group together to see if they could have reached an agreement about whether the group should consider the Universal Basic Income to be a form of welfare or not. However, due to some participants being in a rush to go, and others being on their lunch breaks, the group had to be dispersed and reformed into a new group.
