# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “In principle, yes we should be in favour of universal basic income. It would be a leveller and help address social exclusion and reduce reliance on the state and cut down on the number of people that have to turn to criminal / dangerous activities to make ends meet. It would also increase social mobility and lead to a more fair and equitable distribution of wealth, lifting children out of poverty. However, it is not visible to aim. Each country has own advantages and disadvantages. Would be very hard if not impossible to try reaching basic income for every state in the world. We should try to reach this in the UK, however. It would be a massive difference to so many lives and take away the stresses that an abnormal amount of households face in the UK (one of the richest countries in the world) of just making ends meet and affording things like food. Universal basic income would only help the economy and the people flourish. The minimum wage is too low at the moment in my opinion and it should be increased by at least 20%. I believe in equality for all.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Yes, we should be in favour of universal basic income. We need to help those that need help. It is not right that so many people are living in poverty in the UK, one of the richest countries in the world. The lowest paid should be paid more. The highest earners should be taxed more. A basic income would be a leveller and help address social exclusion and reduce reliance on the state and cut down on the number of people that have to turn to criminal / dangerous activities to make ends meet. It would also increase social mobility and lead to a more fair and equitable distribution of wealth, lifting children out of poverty. It would only help the economy and the people flourish.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “Yes, we should be in favour of universal basic income. We should not expect people to work for a living wage, it should be a basic right. This would help to reduce the reliance on the benefits system and the need for people to turn to crime. The minimum wage should be increased and there should be a basic income for all. It is a leveller and would help to address social exclusion and reduce reliance on the state and cut down on the number of people that have to turn to criminal / dangerous activities to make ends meet. It would also increase social mobility and lead to a more fair and equitable distribution of wealth, lifting children out of poverty. We should be in favour of universal basic income. A base salary for everyone to get basic needs cannot be a bad thing. Tax the highest earners more. Everyone should be able to live life with at least the basics. It would make a massive difference to so many lives and take away the stresses that an abnormal amount of households face in the UK (one of the richest countries in the world) of just making ends meet and affording things like food. Universal basic income would only help the economy and the people flourish.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should be in favour of universal basic income. It is the approach taken in some other countries that have a higher rating on the happiness index than the UK. This approach would be a leveller and help address social exclusion and reduce reliance on the state and cut down on the number of people that have to turn to criminal / dangerous activities to make ends meet. I think that it would also increase social mobility and lead to a more fair and equitable distribution of wealth, lifting children out of poverty. It would make a massive difference to so many lives and take away the stresses that an abnormal amount of households face in the UK (one of the richest countries in the world) of just making ends meet and affording things like food. Universal basic income would only help the economy and the people flourish.
