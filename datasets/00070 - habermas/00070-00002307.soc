# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Yes, the UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050. The climate emergency is becoming increasingly evident through the increasing numbers of global weather phenomena such as heatwaves, wildfires, droughts and ice cap loss. The knock-on effects to wildlife all over the planet is already disastrous and will only get worse should drastic action not be taken. While there are many actions that individuals can take, it is ultimately up to governments and cooperation between nations to work cooperatively towards this goal to avoid a global catastrophe. The UK has a moral obligation to set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050 to help avoid a global catastrophe and to set an example to other countries. The UK has a history of being a leader in this area and should continue to do so.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral (reach net zero) by 2050. The evidence that vastly increased carbon emissions are responsible for altering the climate of the planet is incontrovertible. The climate emergency is becoming increasingly evident through the increasing numbers of global weather phenomena such as heatwaves, wildfires, droughts and ice cap loss. The knock-on effects to wildlife all over the planet is already disastrous and will only get worse should drastic action not be taken. While there are many actions that individuals can take, it is ultimately up to governments and cooperation between nations to work cooperatively towards this goal to avoid a global catastrophe. The significant cost to the taxpayer  and an excessive financial burden on industries and businesses leading to lower competitiveness. Prioritizing a carbon neutral policy would divert resources from other pressing issues. The goal of the government in making this a priority by 2050 will filter down to citizens and create an urgency that is not currently there and prompt swift policy change in respect of achievable ways we can reduce our emissions at home, in the workplace and in our environment as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050. The climate emergency is becoming increasingly evident through the increasing numbers of global weather phenomena such as heatwaves, wildfires, droughts and ice cap loss. The knock-on effects to wildlife all over the planet is already disastrous and will only get worse should drastic action not be taken. While there are many actions that individuals can take, it is ultimately up to governments and cooperation between nations to work cooperatively towards this goal to avoid a global catastrophe. While the goal of the government in making this a priority by 2050 will filter down to citizens and create an urgency that is not currently there and prompt swift policy change in respect of achievable ways we can reduce our emissions at home, in the workplace and in our environment as a whole. My only concern would be the viability of net zero by 2050 and whether this is reasonable or achievable and whether rushing policy or enacting it would not be fully thought through or for a benefit. However, the cost to the taxpayer and an excessive financial burden on industries and businesses leading to lower competitiveness. Prioritizing a carbon neutral policy would divert resources from other pressing issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, the UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050. There is overwhelming evidence that increased carbon emissions are causing a change in the climate of the planet and that this change is having a significant impact on the world we live in. The climate emergency is becoming increasingly evident through the increasing numbers of global weather phenomena such as heatwaves, wildfires, droughts and ice cap loss. The knock-on effects to wildlife all over the planet is already disastrous and will only get worse should drastic action not be taken. While there are many actions that individuals can take, it is ultimately up to governments and cooperation between nations to work cooperatively towards this goal to avoid a global catastrophe.
