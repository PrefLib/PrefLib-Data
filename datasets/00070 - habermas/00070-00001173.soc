# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should not be an age limit above which people cannot get married. If two people want to get married, they should be allowed to do so. It makes no difference if they are 94 years old, if they are in love and want to get married, they should be allowed to do so. The issue of marriage is a private matter and should be left up to the individuals involved.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is not the business of the state to say how old a person should be before they can get married. There are some people who find love when they are young and others who find love later in life. If two people want to get married, they should be allowed to do so, irrespective of their age. This is not an issue that concerns the state. It should be left up to private individuals to decide.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should not be an age limit above which people cannot get married. If two people love each other and want to get married, then they should be allowed to do so. If a 94 year old person and a 22 year old person want to get married, then that is entirely up to them. The state should not interfere with private life decisions, as long as it does not affect anyone else.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the decision that there should not be an age limit above which people cannot get married. This is not an issue that concerns that state. As a result it should be left up to private individuals to decide. If two people in their 90s want to get married, they should be allowed. We don't see why we should stop anyone over the age of 18 getting married if they really want to.
