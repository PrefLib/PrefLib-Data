# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - While I don't agree with making it compulsory, it's not really a big deal? Doesn't really impact people that strongly if they have to wear a face covering. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I don't think that we should. I believe if you are unwell, then the individual should take a considered decision whether he/her should wear a face covering for the betterment of others, but do not feel that everyone should be made to wear one. I think from a societal view, it somewhat dehumanises us, and takes away a lot of what makes humans socialise. I believe the right should go the individual, but if people want to wear something for their own protection, or the protection of others, that choice should be available to them too.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I don't think that masks should be compulsory in all enclosed spaces. I feel that it should be a personal choice and that if an individual wishes to wear a mask for their own reasons then they should be allowed to and people should accept this. On the other hand if everyone chooses to wear masks then they are not exposed to lots of airborne viruses that the body can naturally fight off and then they will not build up a natural immunity to illnesses which would leave the population vulnerable to more pandemics in the future. Masks are ok worn in a minority but not helpful for the health of a majority.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think anything that can be reasonably done to stop the transmission of infectious diseases and what might affect those more vulnerable than myself should be done. I worked throughout the pandemic and wearing a face covering was not a problem at all. However, a lot of people struggle to take responsibility and if it was made mandatory, it would need to be enforced.  Also, in the UK, party gate has eroded what trust was left in the government.  At the end of the day, wearing masks to protect others is no big deal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I acknowledge that some people do have health issues that can be mitigated against by the wearing of face coverings but those people can make the choice to wear a covering to protect themselves and most of them do. I don't think face coverings should be compulsory in enclosed spaces unless someone has a contagious infection or a health condition.
