# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group of participants in general was in favour of the idea that the Prime Minister should be able to use AI to provide advice. The group was of the opinion that the Prime Minister should not rely solely on AI to provide advice, but that it should be used to provide a more well-rounded opinion on a particular issue. The group felt that the Prime Minister would not be able to rely solely on AI, as the Prime Minister would need to make the final decision on the matter, and that a human should be responsible for this. The group was of the opinion that the Prime Minister would be able to use AI to provide advice on more technical matters, but that the Prime Minister should not use AI for advice on matters of morality, as this would not be appropriate.
