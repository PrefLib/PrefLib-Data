# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that it is not the breed of the dog that is important, but rather the way that the dog is raised.  A dog that is well cared for, well trained and well socialised will be a good pet and a good citizen.  We do not think that it should be illegal to own certain breeds of dogs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of making it illegal to keep certain breeds of dogs. However, the group did feel that it was important to ensure that all dogs were well cared for and trained, and that their owners were responsible. The group felt that there was a need for greater education for dog owners, particularly around training and the responsibilities of dog ownership. The group also felt that there was a need for greater regulation of the breeding of dogs, to ensure that puppies were being bred in a responsible way and not just for profit. The group also felt that there was a need for greater regulation of puppy farming and the transportation of puppies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While the State should not be restricting which breeds of dogs can be kept by individuals, some legislation should be implemented to make it more difficult to keep certain breeds of dogs. Perhaps a license should be required to keep dogs of a certain breed, or the dogs should be microchipped and the microchip number could be noted on a database and only accessible by the police or vets. This would help ensure that if the dog were to get out of the house and attack someone, it could be easily identified. All dogs should be trained properly and be aware of the dog owner's family's whereabouts and should be kept under control at all times, to reduce the risk of attacks. Dog owners should also be responsible for any damage or injury caused by their dogs, if the attack could have been avoided had the owner had more control over the dog.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It should not be illegal to keep certain breeds of dogs, but licensing should be required, and perhaps limited to certain individuals and homes.
