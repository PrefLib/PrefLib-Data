# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of maintaining a military presence in the UK.  This is because the UK is a member of NATO and therefore it is important that we maintain a military presence in order to fulfil our obligations to the alliance.  The group also felt that it was important to maintain a military presence in order to protect our borders and our interests abroad.  However, the group also felt that the military budget could be reduced and that some of the money saved could be used to improve the health care system.  The group felt that this was important because the health care system is currently in crisis and that the pandemic has highlighted the weaknesses in the system.  The group also felt that some of the money saved could be used to support the arts.  The group felt that the arts were important to the UK and that they should be supported.  The group felt that the arts were an important part of the economy and that they should be supported.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “We feel that the military is a vital necessity to the country.  We recognise the importance of the military in keeping the UK safe.  However, we also feel that the UK is currently spending too much on the military.  If some money were to be redirected to the health service, we feel that would be a very good use of the funds.  This would help improve the health of the nation and also ensure that the NHS is able to withstand any future pandemic or crisis that comes its way.  Furthermore, we believe that the arts are important to the health of the nation and should be subsidised, however not to the detriment of the health system.

The reason for this is because we need to have a military force to protect us from other countries and to ensure that we are not invaded. The arts are important but we need to ensure that we have a military force to protect us from other countries. We need to ensure that we have a military force to protect us from other countries.
