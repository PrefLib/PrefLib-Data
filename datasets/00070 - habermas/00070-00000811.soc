# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a national vote on whether to build new nuclear power stations. The main reasons for this are because people should have a say on big issues that affect them and their lives. Also, it is expensive to build nuclear power stations and so it is only fair that everyone gets a say on whether to spend the money on them. Also, nuclear power stations can be dangerous and so people should have a say on whether to take the risk.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a national vote on whether to build new nuclear power stations.  The main reason for this was that everyone should have a say in how the world is progressing.  Nuclear power stations are expensive and can be dangerous, so it is only fair that everyone gets a say.  Some people may be against nuclear power stations, but others may be for them.  Therefore, a vote would allow everyone to have their say.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should be given the opportunity to vote on whether or not to build new nuclear power stations.  This is because it is a very expensive project to undertake and so people should have a say in how their money is spent.  The vote should be for everyone as we are all affected by these decisions and we should all be given the right to have a say in what happens in our country and world.  The vote should be after a period of education for people to find out about the pros and cons of nuclear power.  This way people can make an informed decision on the matter.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that there should be a national vote on whether to build new nuclear power stations.  The reason for this is that we live in a democracy and people should be allowed to have their say on such a big issue as this.  Nuclear power is also a very expensive option and so the public should be allowed to have their say on whether this is a good use of their money.  We also believe that people should be educated on the issue before they vote.
