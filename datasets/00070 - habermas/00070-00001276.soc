# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should continue to host refugees from other parts of the world. The UK is obliged to do so for both moral and legal reasons. Morally, we should do so to support those in need and legally, the UK is obliged to do so under the UN Refugee Convention. The number of refugees entering the UK should not be capped. In the UK, we have an abundance of natural resources which we can share with refugees. The UK should continue to host refugees as long as there are genuine refugees who need our help. When it comes to policy formulation and implementation, it is not the opinions of the public that matter. What matters is their attitude. An attitude is a complex concept which combines feelings, beliefs, and values. A policy may be ineffective because the target audience does not believe that the policy will be effective or they don't think that the policy will lead to the desired outcome. Even if they believe in the policy, they may not feel motivated to engage in the behaviour the policy advocates for.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK should host refugees from other parts of the world. This is a moral obligation and also a legal one. However, we must also consider the capacity of our country to provide support and resources to our own citizens and refugees. We must also consider the impact of local communitites and the UK, moral and legal obligations to protect and assist those fleeing persecution or conflitct. It is essential we balance humanitarian concenrs with practical considerations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: we believe the UK should be a refuge for anyone who needs one, but we need to be sure the right measures are in place to ensure this is a success.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the UK should host more refugees from other parts of the world. The UK has a moral obligation to do so and should share some of its resources with those fleeing persecution or conflict. However, the UK must also consider the impact of hosting refugees on local communities and the country as a whole. It is essential to balance humanitarian concerns with practical considerations.
