# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should be doing more to support parents from poorer families to help their children achieve in school. There are many ways in which this could be done, including free school meals and subsidised transport. The government has a duty to ensure that all children have the best chance possible of achieving in school, regardless of their family's wealth.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Education is the right of every child. The government should be doing more to ensure that children from poorer families are given the same opportunities as children from wealthy families. This could include the provision of free school meals, or the provision of more free places at schools. It could also include providing more resources to schools that have children from poorer families. The government should be doing everything it can to ensure that children are not disadvantaged by their family's financial situation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of greater government support to parents to help children from poorer families achieve in school.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Education is the key to success in life. It is a basic human right and not a privilege. Children from poorer families should be given the same opportunities as their wealthier counterparts. The government should do more to support parents from poorer families.
