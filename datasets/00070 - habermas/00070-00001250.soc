# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is important that families can spend time together and have time to relax and take their minds off the stresses of daily life. A holiday or break can provide an opportunity for families to spend quality time together, and to make lasting memories. If families do not have the means to spend time together, the state may want to help. However, given the huge amount of need in society and the relatively small pot of resources available, it is unlikely that subsidising holidays will be the top priority. Moreover, it is not only the cost of holidays that may prevent families from taking them. A lack of resources and options in society, such as good schools and safe areas to live, may also lead families to choose not to travel. However, it is not possible to just create a perfect world and take away all of life's stresses and strains. It is the duty of the state to support the most vulnerable in society, but the state is limited in its capacity to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although holidays have a number of benefits for families, other factors should be considered.  Holiday subsidies would not be the best use of available resources and could lead to the increased cost of holidays for everyone else. It would also increase the risk of unintended consequences, such as additional pressure on the tourism industry, increases in the cost of holidays for everyone else, and unfair targeting of some groups in society.  A more balanced approach would be to take a leaf out of the book of the European Union and make sure that holiday prices are fairly regulated across the board, with people being able to enjoy holidays whenever they want to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we should not subsidise holidays.  We should not be telling people what to do with their money and if they can't afford to go away then that is their problem.  We should not be giving people money for holidays when there are more important things that need to be done with the money.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the idea of subsidising holidays for families is not a good idea. The government has finite resources and should spend its money on more important things. The holiday industry is already very profitable and does not need help from the government. There are charities that can help families who cannot afford holidays and it is not the government's role to provide holidays. However, the government should look at ways of reducing the cost of holidays, such as reducing VAT on holiday accommodation.
