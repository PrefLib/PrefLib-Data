# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we should not reduce the age at which people can drink alcohol. This is because there are inherent dangers in drinking and to reduce the age would be bad. In fact it should be increased to 21.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the age at which people can drink alcohol should not be reduced. This is because there are significant health and safety concerns which would occur as a result of reducing the age limit, and there are numerous other products and activities which present a greater health risk to young people than alcohol. We also believe that young people do not have the life experience to drink responsibly and that this can only be built up over time. Finally, we believe that the age limit of 18 is appropriate, and that the risks of young people drinking before 18 is much greater than the risks of them not drinking before 18.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe the age at which people can drink alcohol should not be reduced. Alcohol presents significant risks and the potential harm it can cause means that it should not be made available to those who are unable to cope with it. Therefore we believe that it should remain at the legal age of 18.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should not reduce the age at which people can drink alcohol. The age of 18 is appropriate, and people should not drink alcohol until they are of legal age. The dangers of alcohol are well known, and it is an addictive substance that can cause serious harm to people of all ages. There are many other substances that young people can access that present a greater risk to their health than alcohol, and it is important that young people are aware of the dangers of these substances. The age limit of 18 is appropriate, and should not be changed.
