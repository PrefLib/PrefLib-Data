# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Charities are important in providing the UK with an avenue to support causes in their home country and around the world. They also provide a way for many to volunteer their time to worthy causes. Unfortunately, as most of the funding comes from individuals, there is a risk of a large amount of funding going to charities that do not operate as effectively as they could.

For this reason, the government should make sure that charities are highly regulated, so that only the charities that are truly dedicated to the causes they support are funded. A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft of a consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement by the participants, and the final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
