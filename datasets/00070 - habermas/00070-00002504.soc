# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The problem for greater regulation should lie with the platforms - they should take more responsibility and be better regulated. The problem with bringing the government into the argument is that the current UK government is already too controlling of our freedom of speech. They have banned gatherings, even passive ones such as candlelit vigils on some occasions. Giving the government greater role in regulating social media platforms is an alternative way for them to control what people are expressing and sharing. I would rather see a neutral body set up to regulate social media platforms - the government could be part of this but should not be in control of it. They are not responsible enough in their own right.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, I do not think they should interfere with the constantly evolving world of social media. They have numerous other areas needing attention, this is surely just a diversion from the huge role of dealing with the economy tanking, poverty, climate control, NHS crisis....get on with Governing the country. Getting bogged down in legislation to control social media platforms would be like trying to catch fog in a net. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I think the government probably needs some stronger role in regulating social media, as there are a lot of risks involved with large open platforms that can foster problematic groups and false news that can be believed by the masses but be harmful in their teachings. However, I also struggle with the idea that the internet should mostly be a free place, where opinions can be shared openly and responded to in the same way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I don't think the government should have a greater role in regulating social media platforms as people should be able to freely express their opinion online. While I do believe that hateful and discriminatory speech should be policed, I do not believe that the government should be able to control what is or isn't available online. This could lead to a more totalitarian state.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I do believe that the government should play a greater role in regulating social media. I dont think they should get involved to the point where it is solely regulated by them but they do need to play a more active role in how social media is run and managed. There is far too many so called influencers on social media that are being looked upto by younger poeople and children and their content is not monitored nearly enough. There is also a lot of hate filled content inciting violence etc on social media that really does need to be monitored more closely and I believe the government should step up and take a more active role in this
