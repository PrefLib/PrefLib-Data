# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We don't think that doctors should be allowed to prescribe illegal drugs such as heroin to addicts.  We don't think that this is a good idea for many reasons.  Firstly, this could lead to a profit motive where illegal drugs are prescribed in order to make money.  This could lead to the privatisation of a part of the NHS via the back door.  Secondly, this could lead to doctors abusing their power and prescribing illegal drugs to their friends.  Illegal drugs are illegal for a reason and can be very dangerous so no person should be able to make that decision.  We definitely would not trust doctors to be able to give these types of prescriptions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we don't think that doctors should be allowed to prescribe illegal drugs such as heroin to addicts.  The reasons for this are that it is very dangerous for people to be taking these drugs and it is also very addictive.  If people are given these drugs it will be very difficult to get them off them and they will be dependent on them for the rest of their lives.  It is also very dangerous to prescribe these drugs to people as they can overdose on them and die.  It is also very difficult to control the amount of drugs that are being prescribed.  This could lead to people selling on their drugs to other people who are not addicts and this will lead to an increase in crime.  This is also a very dangerous thing to do as people will be taking drugs and this will lead to them committing crimes to get money to buy drugs.  This will lead to an increase in crime in society.  This is also very dangerous for the doctors who are prescribing the drugs as they could be attacked by drug dealers who do not want their business to be taken away.  This is also very dangerous for society as a whole as it could lead to a lot of problems in society.  This
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, we should not allow doctors to prescribe illegal drugs such as heroin to addicts as this will allow a way for drugs to enter the community in a legal way and people can be abuse the system.  Also, I don't think we should allow doctors to precribe illegal drugs such as heorion to addicts.  Why?  because I think in the long run there will be too much of a profit motive and this actually will be a way for the privasation of a part of the NHS via the back door.  Absolutely not as why should they have the power to do that as it could be abused and also some doctors may write out prescriptions for so called friends . Illegal drugs are illegal for a reason and can be very dangerous so no person should be able to make that decision. I definitely would not trust doctors to be be able to give these types of prescriptions.
