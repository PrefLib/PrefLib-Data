# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The NHS is a key part of the fabric of the UK, and we believe that it is worth its cost. There are however, several key changes that need to be made to improve its overall efficiency and value. Firstly, we believe that the NHS needs to take a step back and look at the fundamental problems it faces. They need to look at the way they provide treatment, and see how it can be done in a more efficient manner. We also feel that the NHS needs to invest more into preventative healthcare. This will prevent many problems from occurring and ultimately save the NHS money. We feel that the NHS should be given more money to enable them to make these changes, but that this money should be spent in the right way. NHS is a wonderful part of society and I definitely believe that the government needs to look into funding as the project is designed to support those who really need help.  There is an open debate on UK Parliament website on the Future of the NHS.

We feel that the NHS should be given more money to enable them to make these changes, but that this money should be spent in the right way. We also feel that there is an issue with the staffing of the NHS. The NHS needs more staff, and needs to keep the staff that they have. We think that if the NHS can address these key issues, then it can continue to be a valuable part of the UK.
