# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While nuclear power may be seen as a good alternative to coal and fossil fuels in terms of helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it should not be seen as the main solution. The primary focus should be on the long term solution of renewable energy, which is a more sustainable option. However, the government should not completely cut off nuclear power from the list of options in the immediate future. The biggest problem with nuclear power is the threat of a disaster, as seen in the recent Japanese tsunami disaster. The government should enforce strict and high safety regulations to ensure the utmost security and to ensure that the environment is not threatened. In the future, nuclear power should be phased out completely, but until then, it should be seen as a temporary solution while the government focuses on sustainable forms of energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of building new nuclear power stations. The group felt that the potential dangers outweighed the potential benefits. The group felt that the government should be investing in renewable energy sources instead, such as wind power and solar power. The group felt that nuclear power stations are a target for terrorist organisations and that the potential for a nuclear disaster is too great. The group felt that nuclear power stations are not a good use of government finances when there are more important things that need to be funded, such as the health service and education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, we do not think that the government should build new nuclear power stations. There are many reasons for this, however the main one is that they are a target for terrorist organisations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The participants feel that the government should build new nuclear power stations. The energy demand in Australia is increasing every year, so more power stations will be required. This is especially the case as Australia has very low levels of energy production compared to the rest of the world, and is very reliant on fossil fuels. Australia is the only major developed country without nuclear power. However, this will be expensive, and there are questions over whether it is really needed, given that the government has said that they will reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emissions.
