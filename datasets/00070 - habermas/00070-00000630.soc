# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the government should not use drones to monitor for criminal activity. We believe that the use of drones in this way would be too expensive, and the fact that drones can be seen makes them too easy to destroy. Also, the drones would be recording footage of everyone, and this would be a breach of our privacy. We also believe that drones could be used by the government to spy on innocent people, and this is a risk that is too great.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, the government should not use drones to monitor for criminal activity. We believe that the use of drones in this way would be too expensive, and the fact that drones can be seen makes them too easy to destroy. Also, the drones would be recording footage of everyone, and this would be a breach of our privacy. We do believe, however, that there are exceptions to this, such as using drones to follow a criminal who is fleeing the scene of a crime.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, the government should not use drones to monitor for criminal activity. We believe that the use of drones in this way would be too expensive, and the fact that drones can be seen makes them too easy to destroy. Also, the drones would be recording footage of everyone, and this would be a breach of our privacy. We also think that there are better ways to spend the money that would be spent on drones, such as on the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, the government should not use drones to monitor for criminal activity. We believe that the use of drones in this way would be too expensive, and the fact that drones can be seen makes them too easy to destroy. Also, the drones would be recording footage of everyone, and this would be a breach of our privacy.
