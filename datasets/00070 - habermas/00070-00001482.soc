# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We agree that the current level of taxation imposed on companies needs to remain, as to reduce the level would be an economic catastrophe for the country. The current level ensures that companies return the appropriate amount of tax in their country of origin, and it is important to maintain economic stability, which in turn allows the public to thrive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We agree that the current level of taxation on corporations is fair, and serves to benefit the economy as a whole. The idea of lowering the level of taxation on corporations is one that would appear to be favourable for companies, however this would ultimately serve to damage the economy and society as a whole, as companies would feel less need to return to the country from which they originate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While the reduction of taxation for corporations is a move that might appear to be favourable for companies, it is not actually in the best interests of either them or the economy as a whole. In order for businesses to thrive and for countries to remain economically viable, it is essential that all companies pay the taxes that they owe, which is the case with the current level of tax that is charged on companies. Lowering the level of taxation on corporations will only serve to damage the economy and society as a whole, as companies will feel less need to return to the country from which they originate. This will ultimately cause the economy to stagnate, which will only serve to damage the interests of the entire country.  It is also important to note that while it is essential that corporations pay the amount of tax that they owe in order for the economy to function properly, it is also important that companies are not taxed too much, as this will lead to them becoming less profitable, meaning that they will not be able to contribute as much to the economy as they would be able to if they were taxed at a lower rate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Consensus statement reached: While the reduction of taxation for corporations is a move that might appear to be favourable for companies, it is not actually in the best interests of either them or the economy as a whole. In order for businesses to thrive and for countries to remain economically viable, it is essential that all companies pay the taxes that they owe, which is the case with the current level of tax that is charged on companies. Lowering the level of taxation on corporations will only serve to damage the economy and society as a whole, as companies will feel less need to return to the country from which they originate, and will instead feel more inclined to leave the country in search of further profit. This will ultimately cause the economy to stagnate, which will only serve to damage the interests of the entire country.
