# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should encourage the people of the UK to become more health conscious.  Many of us are not aware of the health consequences of our unhealthy lifestyles.  Many fast food outlets and takeaways provide a very unhealthy diet.  The cost of obesity to the UK is £27 billion per year and over half of us are overweight or obese.  We must encourage people to take better care of their health by making healthy eating choices, being more active and ensuring they do not smoke.  This will improve the health of the population, reduce the cost to the NHS and improve the productivity of the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Yes, we should encourage the people of the UK to become more health conscious. This is because the UK has one of the highest obesity rates in Europe, with around a quarter of adults being obese and a further 40% being overweight. Obesity is a risk factor for many diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. Obesity is also a risk factor for poorer mental health, with obese people being more likely to experience depression. Therefore, by encouraging people to become more health conscious, we can help to reduce the rates of obesity and the diseases associated with it, and improve the overall health of the UK population.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People in the UK should be more health conscious. The health of a country is very important for its economical and social development. There are various reasons why people in the UK should be more health conscious. Firstly, the increase in obesity in the UK. The UK is one of the most obese countries in the world. Being overweight or obese is an unhealthy way of living as it can cause various health problems. It is very important to have a balanced diet and do exercise regularly in order to live a healthy lifestyle. Secondly, many people do not know how to have a balanced diet and how to do exercise. People should be educated on the subject. It is also very important for parents to teach their children how to have a balanced diet and how to do exercise, so they can pass on these healthy habits to future generations. The UK government should take measures to encourage people to be more health conscious.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the people of the UK should be encouraged to become more health conscious. This is because people are increasingly becoming more overweight and obese, and this is leading to an increased risk of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer. This will also lead to an increased strain on the NHS, as it will have to deal with more people with these diseases. This will also lead to an increased cost for the NHS, as it will have to spend more money on dealing with these diseases. This will also lead to an increased cost for the government, as it will have to spend more money on the NHS. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the people of the UK to become more health conscious, as this will lead to a healthier population, a healthier NHS, and a healthier economy.
