# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should have a capital gains tax. The UK is a country with a small economy, compared to the global market. In order to maintain our current standard of living, it is necessary to have a tax system that is designed to collect a steady stream of revenue. The current system of taxing profits from the sale of assets is inadequate. Many individuals and companies are able to pay less tax, or even no tax, on capital gains. This means that the UK economy is losing out on revenue that could be used to maintain our social safety net and infrastructure. We believe that the UK economy is too small and too important to rely on unpredictable tax revenues. Taxing capital gains will ensure that we continue to have a balanced budget, and will protect the UK from the threat of a recession.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the UK should not have a capital gains tax. The current tax system already taxes people on their income and on their spending. It would be unfair to tax people twice on the same money. It is also important to incentivise entrepreneurship and risk-taking in the economy. A capital gains tax would discourage people from investing in assets and businesses, which would be detrimental to the economy. However, it is also important to ensure that the wealthiest people in society pay their fair share of tax. Therefore, it would be acceptable to introduce a small capital gains tax on the sale of the most expensive assets, such as large houses, yachts and planes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK should have a capital gains tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should have a capital gains tax, but only on profits above a certain amount. The tax rate should be lower than the income tax rate, and it should be calculated on an annual basis, not on each sale.
