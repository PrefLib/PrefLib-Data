# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Everyone has a responsibility to recycle. The responsibility of individuals is to recycle what they can. The responsibility of businesses and government is to provide the facilities to make this possible and to set an example. It is also the responsibility of businesses and government to ensure that the waste is recycled in a responsible way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, recycling is a good thing to do and everyone should be recycling their waste. However, there are different levels of responsibility for different people and different groups of people. For example, some of the biggest waste producers and those with the greatest impact on the environment are governments and large corporations. These people have the biggest responsibility to recycle, as it is a lot more difficult for individual people to have the same impact. Some people may not recycle because they are not aware of what to do, or where they can recycle. This can be overcome by providing them with information and education, and by making recycling more convenient. It is everyone's responsibility to do their best to recycle. However, everyone's situation is different and some people will not be able to recycle as much as others. This is fine as long as they are doing their best, even if it is a small amount. It is important to understand that individual actions are not enough to make a difference to climate change and pollution. Instead, it is governments, businesses, and communities that have the most responsibility for this. Individual people should do what they can to recycle, but not blame themselves if they are not able to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have a collective responsibility to recycle as much as possible, and to make recycling as easy as possible for everyone. Recycling should be made mandatory for all businesses and local authorities, but also for individuals. However, it is also the responsibility of businesses and local authorities to make recycling easy for individuals, and to provide the necessary infrastructure. This should be a collective effort. Recycling should be made as easy as possible, so that people are more likely to do it. This should be the case for individuals, businesses and local authorities. We must also be aware that recycling alone is not enough to combat climate change, and that individuals cannot solve this problem alone. The government and large corporations have the biggest responsibility to act, and to act quickly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Everyone has a responsibility to recycle. This responsibility extends not only to individuals, but also to businesses, organisations, and government. To ensure this responsibility is met, we must work together to overcome barriers and make recycling easier for everyone. This includes providing appropriate education and facilities, especially for people living in low-income households, so that everyone is aware of the benefits of recycling and knows how to recycle. However, we must also ensure that the recycling that is collected is actually recycled and not just dumped in landfill or shipped off overseas. This is something that can be best achieved through political and economic pressure to ensure that businesses and the government fulfil their responsibility to recycle.
