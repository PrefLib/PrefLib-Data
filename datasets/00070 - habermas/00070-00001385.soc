# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of putting more money into the arts. However, there was a strong feeling that the money should be spent on making the arts more accessible to everyone, rather than just on a select few. The group felt that it was important that the arts were not seen as an elitist pursuit, but rather as something that was for everyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe the government should be putting more money into the arts. If they put money into the creative arts industry, more jobs will be created and more people will be able to work, so there's less unemployment. Also, creative arts jobs can be high-paying, because the jobs can be highly-skilled, so there will be more income for people, which will help businesses that rely on income from the creative arts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of putting more money into the arts. However, it was also felt that the money should be spent in a way that benefits the whole community and not just a small number of people. It was felt that a lot of the money spent on the arts is wasted because it is spent on things that are not accessible to the whole community. The arts should be accessible to everyone and it was felt that there is a need for more arts in schools and in the community. It was felt that the arts should be made accessible to everyone and not just to those who can afford it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We agree that a little more money should be spent on the arts, but only as a last resort, as there are more pressing matters that need to be dealt with first. The creative arts industry is a unique industry, in the sense that the value added to the economy, can be much larger than the value of the creative work, itself. For example, if I write a book and it sells a few copies, if it is adapted into a play in the theatre or a movie at the cinema, the value produced is much greater when it's superimposed, than by itself. The Gross Value Added is greater than the Gross Sales Revenue. Overall, for every £1 spent in producing creative arts by grinding the gears, £3 gets added into the economy from all the ancillary activity that such work helps to foster. However, it must be remembered that the creative arts industry is still an industry. The artists themselves have to make a living and earn a profit from their work. And the more profit they can earn, the more money they can invest back into their work. Therefore, we believe that the arts should be self sustaining, as they have been for the majority of human history, where artists
