# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, we believe that food should be imported from countries that allow animal testing as it would cause an increase in the price of food, which would lead to higher levels of poverty, and it would lead to higher levels of poverty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should ban the import of food from countries that allow animal testing. Although this would cause a rise in the price of food and might lead to higher levels of poverty, we feel that the health and well-being of animals should be a priority and that there are other ways of testing that do not impact the health and well-being of animals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Therefore, the group believe that banning the import of food from countries that allow animal testing is not a practical idea. Instead, the group believe that an option would be to make consumers aware of the origins of the food. This could be a simple solution that could have an impact on this issue and hopefully force countries to make the necessary changes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, we believe that food should be imported from countries that allow animal testing because if we didn't, this would cause a rise in the price of food and it would lead to higher levels of poverty. Furthermore, we would also be interfering in the politics of other countries.
