# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government wants the UK to drive electric vehicles but makes the cost prohibitive. Subsidising electric vehicles would enable more people to purchase electric cars. The cost could be recouped by cleaner air and less health problems caused by pollution. At the moment, most people on average wages cannot afford electric cars
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government need to be putting in policies that are more eco-friendly and support people to make the changes necessary to become more environmentally friendly in their behaviour. Electric vehicles are one way to reduce the impact of diesel and petrol in the UK. In addition, if more people start purchasing electric vehicles then the government can start investing more into the infrastructure to enable a smoother transition from petrol/diesel to electric. Government need to show that they are serious about addressing climate change issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No I'd rather they put more money into Public Transport then people owning cars. it's currently a pain in the arse to use Public Transport as the services need a cash injection and less people owning cars isn't a bad thing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think it's a good idea, but I've heard that electric vehicles are not quite as wonderful as we're told. In terms of environmental sustainability, I'd need to do some more research before I'm convinced it's a good idea for them to be heavily subsidised. That said, they're surely better than the current options, at least for now.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - The life time of an electric car is far less than that of petrol or diesel. As the battery life is not as efficient and hugely expensive and the disposal of these electric cars are much higher volume compared to the traditional petrol and diesel vehicles which can have a lifespan of over 20years or more. The electric cars seem to be inefficient and highly expensive. There will need to be more research and development in the electric vehicle space, before the government should subsidize for the masses. Private sector should invest in the technology to make electric vehicle more durable and have a longer term benefit to the environment. Right now the car batteries have a shorter lifespan. So in short no the government should not heavily subsidize.
