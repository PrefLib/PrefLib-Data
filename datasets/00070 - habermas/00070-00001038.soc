# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour that we are too dependent on the car. This is borne out by the ever increasing numbers of cars on the roads which is causing pollution and congestion in many towns and cities. If public transport was improved in availability and cost then people should be encouraged to use that instead but at the moment it is unreliable, often unavailable and too expensive. This causes people to use their cars for more journeys, often just short ones. People could use bicycles or walk more on short journeys which would have the added benefit of being more healthy for them. We have become more lazy due to having cars and being so reliant on them that we choose to use them instead of other methods.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the car has made our lives easier. It has allowed us to travel long distances quickly and easily. However, we have become too dependent on the car. It is often the only option for many journeys. This has led to increased pollution and congestion. The car is also a major cause of climate change. If we are to reduce the impact of the car on the environment we need to reduce our dependence on it. This can be done by making public transport cheaper, more available and more reliable. People should also be encouraged to walk and cycle more, especially for short journeys.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the car is too much used for short journeys and we are too dependent on it. We need to use our cars less and use other forms of transport such as walking, cycling and public transport more. This will be better for our health, reduce pollution and congestion on our roads. We need to change our lifestyles and make it easier to use other forms of transport. This will require investment in public transport, more cycle lanes and better pedestrian facilities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the car is a very convenient form of transport, but we have become too reliant on it and should try to use other forms of transport more, particularly for short journeys. We should try to use public transport more, but this is often not available or is too expensive. Bicycles are a good alternative and should be encouraged. Walking is also good for our health and we should try to walk more. We need to make more effort to reduce the number of cars on the road, which is causing pollution and congestion. If we want to keep using cars, we should use them less and use them more efficiently. We should try to use cars that are more environmentally friendly, for example electric cars. We should try to use our cars more efficiently by driving more slowly and more carefully. We should also try to use our cars more efficiently by making sure that we are carrying the maximum number of passengers, for example by car sharing.
