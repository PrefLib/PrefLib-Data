# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - National pride is a complex issue. A nation's past should be remembered analytically. Forcing an encouragement of national pride would lead to a dangerous Nationalism as seen in countless examples past and present. On the other hand, it is important to remember history, whether it be good or bad. However, the pride we should have is not for a nation state, but for the people within it. We should be proud of the people who live in this country, who have made it what it is today. The people who live in this country are what make it great, not the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - National pride is a complex issue. To be proud of your country has many benefits including galvanizing the population, team-spirit and goodwill amongst the populace. However, it also encourages the support of governments and their actions, even if these are harmful to the country as a whole. A government should not be encouraging nationalism but should rather encourage patriotism, which is a very different concept. National pride is also a complex issue because it is often based on a wide range of issues, some of which may be controversial. The history of a country is a prime example of this. Many countries have histories which include colonialism and imperialism, as well as slavery. These are highly controversial, and to say that a country has nothing to be proud of because of this, as one participant suggested, is a dangerous idea. Instead, a country's history should be examined and considered, in order to ensure that a greater understanding is developed about how it has come to be the way it is. This can help to avoid repeating mistakes made in the past, and to encourage progress in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, the group has come to the consensus opinion that we should not be doing more to encourage a greater degree of national pride. Whilst we all agreed that it was important to have a sense of national pride, we did not think that we should be doing more to encourage this. It was thought that it was important to have a critical analysis of the nation, and that this could be encouraged by the government, but it was thought that national pride should be encouraged by the populace itself, and should not be encouraged by the government. The thought process behind this was that national pride can be dangerous if it is encouraged too much by the government, as it can lead to a dangerous Nationalism.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - National pride is a complex issue. A nation's past should be remembered analytically. Forcing an encouragement of national pride would lead to a dangerous Nationalism as seen in countless examples past and present. On the other hand, it is important to remember history, whether it be good or bad. However, the pride we should have is not for a nation state, but for the people within it. We should be proud of the people who live in this country, who have made it what it is today. The people who live in this country are what make it great, not the government. The government could do more to make it great, if we had people in power willing to make progressive change.
