# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although there are good arguments to suggest that local elections are a good barometer for public opinion in general elections and a high turn out in local elections could have an effect on turnout and political decisions in general elections, forcing people to vote in local elections may be seen as being undemocratic and is therefore not advisable. Participation in democracy is encouraged however as it is important for public opinion to be expressed through the ballot. This is however ultimately down to each individual and whether they feel strongly about it or not. It is more democratic to have a voluntary system where those that wish to take part in democracy and have their voice heard are able to do so. It may be that it would be more beneficial in the long run for politicians to increase public participation in elections rather than trying to make people vote when they do not wish to do so. The rights of the individual are paramount in our democratic society and we should not encourage anything which may infringe upon this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The general consensus of the group was that voting in elections should be encouraged, however that it should not be compulsory. Some members of the group were concerned that compulsion could lead to increased democratic imbalances and could be undemocratic in principle. Furthermore the general view was that voting was an essential part of a democracy and should be encouraged. We feel that local elections are important as they provide a barometer for a predicted general election and are an important factor in how democracy works. There was a feeling that some people would not turn up to vote if voting was made compulsory and therefore would not be allowed their democratic right. Overall we feel that encouraging people to vote is the best way to ensure a good turnout of voters.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of people being encouraged to vote, however we did not think that it should be compulsory as this could be seen as undemocratic.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We agree that the current system is the most democratic. We agree that people should be encouraged to vote in local elections. However, we feel that it is not the most democratic to force people to do so. We think that this would take away people's freedom of choice, which we believe to be a fundamental part of democracy. We feel that voting is an important part of a democracy, however if people do not wish to vote then they should not be forced to do so. We also agree that it is important that people have their say and make their voices heard. However, people should not be forced to make their voices heard.
