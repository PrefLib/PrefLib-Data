# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Income is something that is very important to everyone in society. The way we allot income is very important to the function of society. We have different ideas of how this should work and what we would like it to do. The consensus is that there should be a basic income provided to all UK citizens by the government. It should be enough to live on but if you work you should be able to earn more. This should replace the benefits system. Everyone would then be able to work and contribute to the economy, or choose not to and live on the basic income. There is a cost to the government in implementing this. This will be borne by taxing the rich more. The costs are likely to be recouped by an increase in the GDP.
