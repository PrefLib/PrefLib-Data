In the future, the world will be increasingly based on science and technology, therefore more government funding for primary schools should be a priority. The new funding could be used to invest in advanced teaching resources, to improve the quality of teaching, to improve the quality of teaching resources, and to reduce class sizes. If more government funding was to be invested into primary schools, there would be a knock-on effect in terms of benefits for society, such as lower crime rates, lower unemployment, and an increased proportion of the population being active in the community.
