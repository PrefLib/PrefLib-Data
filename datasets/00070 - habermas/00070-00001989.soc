# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the UK has strict gun control laws. The laws should be made stricter still. Gun crime is often committed by those who have obtained the weapons illegally. The laws should be tightened to make it even more difficult for people to get hold of guns. This is the only way to prevent a descent into frequent mass shootings. Shooting for recreation should be stopped also.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Gun control laws should be tightened. The UK has strict gun laws, but these should be made stricter. The sale and distribution of guns should be further controlled, and there should be harsher punishments for those who illegally obtain or distribute guns. Shooting for recreation should be stopped also.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Gun crime is on the increase and we should not be complacent. There are simply too many incidents, including those of a fatal nature, that show that guns are still too accessible to the wrong people. While we can sympathise with people who use guns for recreation, and understand that there are certain professions which require to use guns, we believe that stricter controls on who can possess guns and how they are stored are essential. We also think that there needs to be more education and awareness in relation to guns, particularly when it comes to children. Children are the people who are most likely to see a gun and think that it is a toy, and therefore it is crucial that they are taught from a young age to understand that guns are dangerous and to be avoided.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the UK has very strict gun control laws which have been very successful in preventing mass shootings. There have been some very rare exceptions, but in general the laws are very successful. However, we think that they could be made even more strict. For example, it should be made more difficult to obtain a gun license, and those who do have a license should be subject to more stringent checks. Also, it should be made illegal to own a gun for recreational purposes. The only people who should be allowed to own guns are those who require them for their work, such as gamekeepers, farmers and environmentalists, and those who require them for their hobby, such as clay pigeon shooting. Also, those who are allowed to own guns should be subject to strict laws on how they store their guns, and should be required to have secure gun safes.
