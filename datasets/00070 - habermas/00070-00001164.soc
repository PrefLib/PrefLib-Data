# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that smoking should be banned in all public places such as restaurants, pubs, clubs, work places, schools and colleges, etc. However, we believe that designated smoking areas in these places should be introduced where people can smoke without damaging the health of those around them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that smoking should be banned in all public places such as restaurants, pubs, clubs, work places, schools and colleges, etc. However, we believe that designated smoking areas in these places should be introduced where people can smoke without damaging the health of those around them. The benefits of doing this is that it could encourage people to cut down on smoking or even stop smoking altogether, which will have a positive effect on their health, their wallet, and their quality of life. Furthermore, those who do not smoke will not be inhaling toxic chemicals and pollutants. The reason why this should be banned is because it not only has a negative impact on the person smoking, but those around them as well. It could be argued that this is a part of their human rights to smoke, but at what price is this right as it is putting the health of those around them at risk.

This will also remove the opportunity for younger people to start smoking, as they will be less likely to see smoking as normal.
