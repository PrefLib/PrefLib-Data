# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the decision that the use of propaganda is not acceptable to shape public opinion. We believe that by the government doing this they are taking advantage of their position and manipulating the public's opinion on things. This could cause the public to have a negative view of the government and the public's trust in the government could be ruined. We also believe that by the government using propaganda the public may not be getting the full truth and what the government are actually saying and may not be the whole story. We have all agreed that the use of propaganda should not be allowed and should be looked into further as it could affect the trust in the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Propaganda is a weapon that can be used by anyone to shape opinion. Unfortunately, it's also something that can be used for bad reasons as well as good. It can be used by powerful organisations to prevent criticism and silence dissident voices. It can also be used to undermine a nation's electoral process, to influence voters, and shape public opinion in ways that may not be in the interests of the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, it is not acceptable for the government to use propaganda to shape public opinion. In some countries this may be the case but in our country we should be able to trust what the government says. We do not want to be a dictatorship and have our voices heard. We want the government to be truthful and honest at all times.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, It is not acceptable for the government to use propaganda to shape public opinion. Propaganda is where a government is attempting to convince people of something that isn't necessarily true.
