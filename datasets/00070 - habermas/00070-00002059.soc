# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Teachers are often considered by children as being experts on every topic, but that is not always the case. It is important for teachers to be able to express their views in the classroom and for this to happen they need to have been trained appropriately. However, we must acknowledge that there are also dangers to expressing views in the classroom. Teachers need to be careful to always present a balanced view and should always present the opposing view, if there is one, and not present one-sided views to the students. The best way to present both sides of an argument in the classroom is through allowing students to develop their own view by engaging in class debates or group discussions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Teachers are considered by children as being experts on every topic, but that is not always the case. It is important for teachers to express their views in the classroom and for this to happen they need to have been trained appropriately. However, we must acknowledge that there are also dangers to expressing views in the classroom. The best way to express both sides of an argument in the classroom is through allowing students to develop their own view by engaging in class debates or group discussions.     Given the role that views play in culture, and that we are all used to engaging in a debate of issues and ideas, it is inevitable that teachers hold and express personal views in the classroom. So perhaps instead of forbidding teachers to express their own views, we must instead ensure that they are trained in the best way to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Teachers should be allowed to express their views in the classroom. However, teachers must be trained in how to express their views, and should be aware of the dangers of expressing one-sided views. Teachers should also make sure to present the opposing view to their own, and allow students to develop their own views by engaging in class debates or group discussions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Teachers should only express their views in a balanced and safe manner so that students have the chance to develop their own views, express their opinions and develop their skills of analysing and challenging points of view. Teachers are often considered by children as being experts on every topic, but that is not always the case. It is important for teachers to be able to express their views in the classroom but in a balanced way. However, we must acknowledge that there are also dangers to expressing views in the classroom. Teachers should never present one-sided views to the students. The best way to present both sides of an argument in the classroom is through allowing students to develop their own view by engaging in class debates or group discussions.
