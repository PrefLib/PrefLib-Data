# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I believe at least some money should be given to improving the railway network.  I rarely use railway myself but when I do it's always been to a high standard.  A LOT of people that I both know well and know little use this service and when railway lines or railway services are impacted it has a huge detrimental impact on travel, work and disrupts peoples lives.  Due to COVID and hybrid conditions a lot of people have moved further out from city centres (also due to affordability), this they rely heavily on trains for transport.  With there being more and more restrictions placed on car travel in city centres also trains are an obvious alternative so you may find that people use it more and more often because of this in the future.  The infrastructure needs to be there to counter this future change.  There are not many alternatives that allows people to travel timeously between low and highly built areas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, I think this is a very important issue especially because there have been a lot of strikes since last summer and this has affected lots of people
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes. They're absolutely disgraceful. More spending is needed to improve the railways.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In my opinion allocating increased funding to enhance the railway network is crucial for reducing traffic congestion, minimising environmental pollution and promoting cleaner air in ubran areas.   Secondly, investing in railways can boost the economy by creating jobs both in the short and long term. It stimulates growth in related sectors like manufactoring, technology and construction.   Moreover, an improved railway network can enhance overall connectivity, making transport more convenient for everyone (such as people in remote areas). This will allow people to stay together.
