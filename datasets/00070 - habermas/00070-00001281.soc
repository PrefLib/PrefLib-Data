# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to have their own Instagram account. They are not yet at an age where they can fully comprehend the consequences of their actions and the dangers of the platform. It is important to note that Instagram is not a site that can be fully monitored by parents and children could be exposed to inappropriate content. The social media platform has been shown to have a negative effect on the body image and mental health of young people who use the site. It would be irresponsible to allow children under 13 to have their own Instagram account.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the effect of social media on children under the age of 13 is overwhelmingly negative. Their mental health is damaged and their perception of reality skewed by the highly-edited, often staged and surreal images of the lifestyles of people they follow on social media. The issue is not so much the content itself as the volume of it. Social media also exposes children to adult content, making it easier for them to gain access to pornography and extreme material that they may not otherwise come across. There are some positives to social media use in terms of interaction with other young people and building confidence and a sense of community, but ultimately the downsides outweigh the upsides.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed their own Instagram account. This is because there is much content on the site that is inappropriate for this age group, and they cannot be fully monitored if they are using their own account.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed their own Instagram account. This is because there is a large amount of inappropriate content on Instagram which could be harmful to the mental health of young children. The content is also often of an adult nature which is not suitable for children. Having their own account means that they cannot be monitored in the way that they might if they were using a parents' account.
