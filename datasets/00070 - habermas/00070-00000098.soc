# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Capitalism has been a key driving force in the development of the modern world and has created a lot of wealth. But the exploitation of workers and the environment has been excessive and needs to be reduced and better managed. The benefits of capitalism are needed for society to move forward but the system needs to be managed more carefully to ensure the benefits are shared equally by all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Capitalism is the best system for the economy. However, people with power can exploit people in need. The system is very good, but only if it is not abused by corrupt leaders.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Capitalism is a structure that allows for the survival of the fittest. This structure only creates the potential for more wealth in the long run, as it encourages entrepreneurship and innovation. This is good for society. However, capitalism does not necessarily reward people who provide a positive service to society. In the long run, capitalism does not prioritise what is best for the people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Global capitalism is exploitative and unsustainable, however the solution to this is to shift to a model of cooperation and shared prosperity.
