# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, we believe that the government should subsidize sports in state schools. The current generation of children are less active than previous generations and this could lead to further problems down the line. Therefore, we think that the government should subsidize sports so that more children can take part and develop an interest in physical activity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of subsidised sports in state schools. We feel that as long as the UK government can afford to fund it, then subsidising sports in state schools is a positive thing. It would help the public health of the country by helping to reduce obesity. The issue is however not straightforward. It depends on how much money is being put into sports and whether it will have a big impact. Some people may also disagree with subsidising sports in state schools as they may feel that not enough money is being spent on the core subjects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Sports in state schools should be subsidized. Children should have the opportunity to participate in sports and exercise, and the more children who do so the greater the health benefits. Sports and exercise also teach young children valuable life skills including teamwork and competitiveness.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the UK government should subsidize sports in state schools. We all recognise that sports participation has numerous health benefits and can also serve as a good career option for some people. We believe that subsidizing sports in schools should be treated the same way as funding for other school subjects.
