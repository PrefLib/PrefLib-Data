# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Fast food chains should not be banned from operating near schools. There are many factors that influence children's health, and fast food is only one of them. Fast food chains provide jobs for many people, and banning them from operating near schools would be unfair to them. Children are influenced by many things, and banning fast food near schools would not be a very effective way of tackling childhood obesity. It would be better to educate children on why fast food is unhealthy, and provide cheap, healthy school meals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Fast food chains should be allowed to operate near schools, but should be encouraged to provide healthy options on their menu. They should also be encouraged to provide nutritional information on their food. The group felt that banning fast food chains from operating near schools would be an ineffective measure, as it would be easy for children to access fast food from other locations. Instead, they felt that the best approach would be to educate children on the importance of healthy eating, and to provide healthy meals in schools.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not ban fast food chains from operating near schools. We feel that it is not the responsibility of the fast food chain to stop children from eating their food, and that this responsibility lies with parents and schools. The fast food chains should not be blamed for the choices that children make. However, we feel that fast food chains should be encouraged to provide healthier options, and that schools should be encouraged to provide healthier meals. We also feel that children should be educated on the health risks of fast food, and that parents should be encouraged to provide healthy meals at home.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Fast food chains should not be banned from operating near schools. The issue is more complex than simply banning them. Children have free will and banning the chains will not stop them from eating fast food. The issue is more complex and requires more education on healthy eating and why fast food is bad for you. We also need to ensure that children have access to healthy food and that healthy food is more affordable than fast food.
