# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Generally speaking - yes. The world is already polluted with litter, in particular plastic, and single use containers only adds to this. While they are useful for takeaways, there are some which have a much smaller impact on the environment. Cardboard based containers are a great alternative as even if not recycled, they biodegrade quickly. But cardboard containers aren't suitable for all kinds of foods, which poses an issue in itself
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should ban single use containers but only if it wont cost the consumer more. The large companies should absorb the extra costs and offer materials like glass that consumers can recycle and receive money from doing so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes I think we should as a lot of these end up in landfill, even when they are put in the recycling centres as they can be contaminated and then are not recycled. They can be very damaging to the environment, some countries have come up with clever ways to combat this in their supermarkets like in Germany, where you take your own containers in for various different food items and also drinks.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is some use for them. Maybe we should ban them but we should also be looking into replacing what the containers are made of.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I think we should ban all single use food containers, it is a major cause for excess plastic which harms the environment, both from production and waste. There are much more eco friendly option which do not have the same negative environmental impact, whilst remaining at a similar price point. Moreover, there is the additional benefit of removing microplastics from foods which is a common theme of using single use plastic, whilst the effects of microplastics are not completely known currently the consensus is they are harming both humans and the planet.
