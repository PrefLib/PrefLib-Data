# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have a duty to protect children and other vulnerable people and we have the right to legislate for them, but we should not impose our values on others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A minimum unit price is a form of prohibition by the back door. It would impact upon the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. The nation should be educated on the dangers of alcohol rather than punishing everyone who consumes it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not have a minimum unit price for alcohol. The vast majority of people who drink do so responsibly. In the vast majority of cases it is not alcohol that is the problem, but rather the person consuming the alcohol. It is the responsibility of parents to control how much alcohol their children consume and if parents are unable to do this, then the state should not have to. Alcohol should not be made more expensive for everyone, just because a small minority of people are unable to control themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to minimum unit pricing, with one person being undecided. Some of the reasons given were as follows: 1. The whole population should not be punished for the irresponsible behaviour of a few. 2. Drinking is a matter of personal responsibility. The individual has to make their own decision about whether they want to drink or not. 3. The government should not interfere with the choices of adults. 4. It is not right to treat adults as children. 5. It is not fair to the majority to force them to pay more for alcohol. 6. People have to be allowed to make their own decisions. 7. There will be problems with defining what a unit is and how to apply it to different types of alcohol. 8. People will still find a way to get alcohol if they really want to. 9. A minimum unit price will mean the poorer people have to pay more. 10. Responsible drinkers should not be punished. 11. The supermarkets and alcohol retailers should not be allowed to profit from irresponsible drinking. 12. An individual's choice to drink should not be controlled by the government. 13. It is not possible to stop people from getting alcohol if they want
