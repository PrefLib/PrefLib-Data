# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the bridge, although with reservations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A bridge to Northern Ireland would be very difficult to build, and very expensive. The current consensus opinion is that it is not necessary to build a bridge to Northern Ireland.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group have come to the consensus view that we should not be building a bridge to Northern Ireland. This is due to the potential negative impacts it could have on the surrounding area and the cost of construction. It would also impact shipping lanes which could result in negative effects on the local economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We think that the Government should build the bridge. The bridge will improve tourism and transport links between Scotland and Northern Ireland. This will benefit the economies in both countries. The bridge will be a welcome addition to the infrastructure of both Scotland and Northern Ireland. The bridge will also be an internationally known structure which will attract more tourists to the areas.
