# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be the option for people to sell their organs as this would be beneficial for those who need transplants. However, it is of paramount importance that there are strict regulations in place to prevent exploitation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should not be able to sell their organs, but in certain situations, such as if the donor is aware of the health implications and are financially comfortable and there is no chance of coercion, then this could be allowed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the idea of selling organs to be used in transplants is unethical as people should not be exploiting their own bodies for profit. The idea of donating organs to help others is one that is already very established and is a selfless act in which people should feel good about. This should be encouraged, but if people want to sell their organs, they should be free to do so, as it is their body and therefore their choice. There would need to be careful regulation put in place to make sure that the person selling their organ is doing so of their own free will and isn't being exploited. It should also be heavily regulated to make sure that the transplant surgeons are not using organs from people who are being exploited or are using organs that have been tampered with, such as the genetic makeup being altered.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People should not be allowed to sell their organs. The health and safety of the seller should be a priority and if they can not be assured this then the process should not take place.
