# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: All children should have access to a laptop for homework. They should be able to take the laptop home but would need to return it after use. If their family cannot afford to buy a laptop then the child should be entitled to a free one from the school. The school should also provide ongoing support for the use of the laptop in terms of technology help desk. This would help all children in school have access to the same technology and level the playing field for all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of free laptops for children but thought that it was important to make sure that there was an appropriate level of support for them in order to use them effectively. They thought that it would be very important to provide free technical support to ensure that children and their families were able to use the laptops to their full potential. The group thought that if children were able to take their laptops home, it would be essential to include some parental support as well. In conclusion, I think that although I was very skeptical of the process before it began, it worked very well. I believe that the system is very useful for group discussion and decision making. It is easy to use and quite interesting and enjoyable as well. I would like to use it again in future and would recommend it to others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In principle, we believe that all children in schools should be given free laptops. The issue of cost needs to be addressed though. It is clearly going to be very expensive and difficult to achieve. A more realistic option may be to set up a scheme whereby families who cannot afford to buy their own laptop are given one free of charge. This would also help to reduce the likelihood of the laptops being misused.  Of course, if the cost of laptops dropped significantly in the future, then it may be possible to give them out free to all children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children should receive laptops if they need to use them to complete schoolwork. If they don't need to use them then they should not be forced to. If they are being given out for free they should be given to those who are most in need. If they need to be used for home work as well as school work then maybe they should be given on a case by case basis.
