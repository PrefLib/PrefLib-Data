# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I had thought the voting age is already at 18, however, regarding the requirement for all students to vote, I believe that it would be very beneficial for the UK if done correctly. Younger people will be influenced most by the decisions made by government, a prime example of this is Brexit, if younger people were involved more then it would have reduced the chance of the UK leaving the EU. Nevertheless, young people need to be educated in schools on government policies and voting, to ensure they are able to make a decision based on their future goals and visions. Furthermore, instead of punishing people for not voting, incentives should be given to ensure students want to vote 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: i thought the age was already 18 so i dont see how this would change things, however i believe all students should vote as i think they are the ones that could make a big difference in terms of votes as i think this age group has a poor turnout in terms of poll day . I think if they were required to vote this would make a big difference to politics and the polls in this country . 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: As far as I am aware, the voting age in the UK is 18 - therefore I cannot provide an opinion on raising it to what it currently is.  Regarding forcing students to vote, this is not very democratic. Everyone has the right to vote but should not be forced to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The voting age in the UK is 18 and has been for around 50 years. I do not know why students in particular should be required to vote, as opposed to other social groups. Enforcing voting by law is a topic I am unsure about because although voting is extremely important, not all citizens/ those eligible to vote feel represented by the current political system. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: No I don't think they should be requiring anyone to vote. If they did a better job of managing the country and following through on plans and promises people would willingly vote for who they deem the best for the job.
