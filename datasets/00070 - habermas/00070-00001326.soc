# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Medicine cannabis should be made available for prescription by doctors to alleviate symptoms of illness and chronic pain. This would help alleviate the opioid crisis as it has fewer side effects and far less addictive qualities. It would also prevent the proliferation of drugs from criminal organisations, which could also lead to exploitation. The health risks of cannabis are fairly limited and there is substantial evidence that it could help alleviate symptoms of illness or chronic pain. This would also allow strains of cannabis to be cultivated that focus on the healing and pain relieving qualities of the drug, as opposed to the psychoactive qualities which people are not always comfortable with. Conditions: 1. Everyone who is entitled to participate in the decision must be allowed to contribute to the debate. 2. Everyone who is entitled to participate in the debate must be given the chance to voice their views. 3. Only possible options should be suggested. 4. All views that affect the final decision of the group must be taken into consideration. 5. The final decision must be based on the current conditions and participants.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The medical benefits of cannabis have been proven in numerous studies. Even though it can have some short term negative effects, it can have long term positive effects when used in an appropriate manner and outweighs other drugs that have negative health consequences. It has proven to alleviate pain and can be an alternative for more dangerous painkillers like opioids. In a medical setting, it has been used to treat a variety of conditions, ranging from chronic pain, arthritis, PTSD, epilepsy to Crohn's disease and migraines. Growing evidence suggests that cannabis can even treat and mitigate cancer. Beyond the benefits it has for people suffering from illnesses and the long term consequences of the opioid crisis, legalising medical cannabis would have many more effects. It would take control of the drug from criminal organisations which can often lead to exploitation of the vulnerable. It would also make the drug significantly more affordable and accessible for people who are already using the drug for medical purposes. The argument that weed makes people lazy or prone to crime is easily dispelled, as has been argued for alcohol or tobacco. Regulating the drug would allow for its quality to be ensured, but this would also allow cultivating strains which are more concentrated on the medical uses of the drug

This would also allow horticulturalists to generate strains with the beneficial compounds and less of the psychoactive compounds as people are not always comfortable with something that can have a strong effect. Cannabis is consumed on a large scale and, in the UK, it is all acquired illegally which gives money to organised crime and can encourage exploitation.

It is important that the government monitor its use and limit its use to certain ailments, to prevent it from being abused or taken for the psychoactive effects.
