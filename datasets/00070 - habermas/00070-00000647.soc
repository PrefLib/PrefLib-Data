# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to Scotland becoming independent. It was felt that Scotland would not be able to survive on its own as an independent country. However, if the majority of people in Scotland do want to become independent, then this should be allowed. This is because, as one participant pointed out, it would be unfair to prevent Scotland from being independent if the majority of people living there wanted this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of independence, but with some reservations. The primary reservation was the economic viability of an independent Scotland, and the fact that it would probably need to adopt the Euro in order to be accepted into the EU. This would have a detrimental effect on the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Scotland should be given the option to vote on independence again in the future. They should have the option to do so after a reasonable amount of time has passed since the last referendum. However, this option should not be offered until after Brexit has been fully implemented and the UK has had time to assess the impact of this decision.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of independence for Scotland. The benefits of an independent Scotland are numerous, and include greater sovereignty, greater democratic accountability, and the ability to forge their own path. The group was, however, of the opinion that there are numerous disadvantages to independence, and these include the potential loss of subsidies from the UK, the need to establish new institutions and infrastructure, and the potential for future disputes with the rest of the UK.
