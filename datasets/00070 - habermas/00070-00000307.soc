# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that there should be a proportion of council housing that no one can buy, in order to give housing to those in need and to prevent a growing homelessness crisis in the UK. This is because it would prevent council housing from being used as a means of profit and also because it would provide the best long term solution to homelessness in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be some council housing that no one can buy as this would be beneficial for vulnerable people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, as people deserve to be able to buy their own property, however we do need to keep a supply of council houses available to vulnerable and low income people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of council housing that no one can buy.
