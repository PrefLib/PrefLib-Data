# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “We have come to the conclusion that we should not replace the income tax with an additional value added tax (VAT) on goods and services. We already pay plenty of tax, and inflation will mean that we pay more tax every year cumulatively, so it makes no difference whether we pay an additional VAT. However, it may encourage people to spend less money on goods and services, which will negatively impact the economy. We believe that those with higher incomes should be taxed more and those in the median range should be taxed less. Adding VAT to goods and services would punish those who earn less. No income tax is deducted at a level once people have earned a basic level of income. Adding extra VAT increases the cost straight away on goods and services making items more expensive for everyone regardless of income. This passes more of the tax burden lower down. We think that this might help people to budget more effectively as they have more of a choice as to paying the tax or not. We do not think it is necessary to replace the income tax with an additional added tax. We already pay tax on goods and services so there is no need to add an additional tax. We pay enough.”
