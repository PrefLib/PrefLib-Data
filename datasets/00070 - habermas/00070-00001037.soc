# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children under the age of 14 should not be allowed to have social media accounts, and there should be a system in place that prevents children from being able to access the accounts of their parents and older siblings. The group also came up with the following reasons to support their view: - The people who work at social media companies don't let their children use social media, so it seems like a bad thing for a developing mind. - Social media can be dangerous - the apps are built in such a way to encourage constant use and can lead individuals to be exposed to inappropriate content. - Without guard rails social media can be dangerous - the apps are built in such a way to encourage constant use and can lead individuals to be exposed to inappropriate content.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should impose a minimum age on social media use. However, it is important to note that social media is not all bad, and it can be a good thing. For example, it can help people stay in touch with friends and family. We believe that the minimum age should be 14 as this is the age that most children start secondary school. At this age they are more mature and can understand the risks of social media. We also think that social media companies should have filters in place to stop children seeing harmful content.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a minimum age for social media use. We believe that social media can be dangerous for children and can cause them to become addicted to it. The minimum age should be 12 or 13, as this is the age when children are able to use social media responsibly. The social media companies should also have more control over the content that is displayed, and should have a more efficient way of filtering out inappropriate content.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Social media has a number of negative effects on the mental health of young people. There is no doubt that social media is addictive and it is difficult to control the amount of time people spend on it. The apps are built in such a way to encourage constant use and can lead individuals to be exposed to inappropriate content. Also given the anonymous nature of many of the systems essentially anyone could speak with the children without serious controls. We believe that the only really meaningful way to do this would be via use of a minimum age as well as improved parental controls / safe spaces for younger uses.
