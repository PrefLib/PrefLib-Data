# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was neutral in regards to the issue. The group believes that cellphones can be a good tool in classrooms as they can be used to find useful information, which in some cases can be hard to find. The group agrees that cellphones can be distractive and cause students to lose focus on their work, but can also be used for a learning experience, and could be a benefit to the students learning.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Students should be allowed to have their cellphones in class with a couple of exceptions. This will only be the case if the student has the cellphone on silent and all games and social media is off. The student must also be using the cellphone for a study-related purpose and not just because they feel like it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, Students should not be allowed to have cell phones in class, however we do think that it is a good idea for students to be able to use a calculator on a phone in Maths class if they are stuck on a question. Students will use the phones to play games, check social media and text, this is a huge distraction and could lead to a student failing their exams. If students really need to use a phone then the phone should be switched off and in their school bag and it should only be taken out for the duration of the lesson, at the end the phone is placed back in the bag.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Students should be allowed to have cellphones in class. Students can use them for study related purposes. The teacher must ensure the students are not using their phone for social media during lesson times.
