# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The current system of organ donation is ethically sound. The system is built on a foundation of respect for individual autonomy and a presumption in favour of donation. It is also built on a system of presumed consent, with the option to opt-out if one does not want to be an organ donor. This makes it very difficult to argue that the system is not ethically sound. The system could be improved, however, by making the default option to be a donor, rather than the other way around. This would increase the number of organs available for donation, and help to reduce the number of people on the waiting list.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The current system is ethically sound. The group felt that the consent of the donor should be made the default, but that this default can be changed at any time by the donor, so that there is no change to the principle that no-one can be compelled to donate their organs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We feel that the current system of organ donation is ethically sound. In our view it provides the basis for a system that ensures that people’s organs are donated only with their consent and is a system that does not discriminate on the basis of socio-economic status, or religion, or gender, or sexual orientation. However, it is a system that can be improved. In particular, we feel that the default status should be ‘donor’ and people should then have the option to opt-out of the system. This may improve the number of donors, and provide a better balance between a person’s autonomy, and the common good.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the current system of organ donation is ethically sound. It is the case that the current system requires the express permission of the potential donor, and this is an important ethical consideration. However, the current system is also the most efficient way of getting the organs that people need to live a full life. The current system has the advantage of being able to provide organs to those in need without requiring the deaths of people who are not in need of organs. The current system also has the advantage of being the most efficient way of getting organs to those who need them. The current system is also the most efficient way of getting organs to those who need them.
