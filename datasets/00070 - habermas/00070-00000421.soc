# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The NHS is a socialist institution because it is funded by the taxes that the people pay, it also has a duty of care to all people and is not a profit making institution. It also serves to provide a service that is free to all regardless of income and status.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although some aspects of the NHS are Socialist, it cannot be said to be completely Socialist as it is controlled by the government and not the community.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the NHS is not a socialist institution. Although there are elements of socialism involved in the running of the NHS, it is still mainly capitalist due to the large role of the government in how the NHS is run and the capitalistic and free market principles they follow.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The NHS is a socialist institution in terms of ideology but not necessarily in its operation, because it is not controlled by the community.
