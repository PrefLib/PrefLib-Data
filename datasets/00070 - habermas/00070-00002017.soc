# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Schools should definitely be teaching philosophy. It helps to develop logical thinking, creative thinking and critical thinking, all of which are very important skills in the modern day. The ability to present a convincing argument is also a useful skill that would be beneficial to people in their everyday lives. There is a lot of nuance in philosophy that is not often discussed, and many people do not consider it. If schools taught philosophy, it would allow people to consider different ideas and become more well rounded as people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Schools should teach philosophy to a greater extent than they currently do. Philosophy is often referred to as learning to think, and can be a very useful tool for students. Philosophy has a lot of common ground with logic and writing convincing arguments. Both of these are essential skills for everyone. Many people today would benefit from being able to organise and delivery their thoughts and opinions about different topics. WIth philosophy, students would also be able to construct and deconstruct arguments for and against many topics. However, it is also important that schools teach other subjects to a greater extent. For example, classes focusing on life skills such as taxes and politics related topics could be beneficial for young people. Therefore, teaching philosophy would be a good idea, as long as other more important issues arent forgotten about.
