# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of using more of the UK's land to grow food. The general feeling was that more food needs to be produced in the UK, not just for export but to feed the people. The consensus opinion was that food produced in the UK is fresher, has less air miles (i.e. less environmental impact), and helps reduce the need for importing food, making us less reliant on other countries. In this example, it is clear that the opinion of the group as a whole was more liberal and in favour of using more of the UK's land to grow food than any individual opinion of the participants. It is also evident that this more liberal group opinion was reached after much debate and deliberation on the issue.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should be using the UK's land to grow food instead of importing from other areas of the world for when it can be helped. It is more sustainable that importing. Using local farmers and using their produce, will only help in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe the UK should be using more of its own land to grow food. This will reduce the reliance of the UK on other countries for food supplies and reduce the import of foods, leading to more money being spent within the UK economy. This will also lead to a decrease in emissions from transporting the food from overseas, as well as the fact that the food will be fresher and thus have a longer shelf life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, yes we should use more of the UK's land to grow food, as it is more sustainable and can help in situations such as the pandemic. Local produce is healthier and we would be reducing our carbon footprint as we would not be importing as much food.
