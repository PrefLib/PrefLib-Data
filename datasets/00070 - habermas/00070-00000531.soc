# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “After a debate, we came to the consensus view that school league tables should not be abolished as they can promote healthy competition between schools. This can help schools thrive and students receive the best teaching.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although league tables have a detrimental impact on education by creating a negative competitive culture, they are still useful for parents to use when making an informed choice about their child’s education. They also provide a way to rate schools in a way which includes multiple different factors which go into teaching and education. The league tables also encourage healthy competition between schools which has been proven to improve education and help schools strive to be the best they can be.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we do not think all school league tables should be abolished. Although we recognise that some league tables are detrimental to student wellbeing and are often based on purely academic success, we believe that league tables are a good way of comparing schools and identifying the best ones in your area. We also believe that league tables encourage teachers and students to try their best and achieve the best results possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should not abolish all school league tables. They can be a very useful guide for parents in helping to decide on the school for their children. However league tables need to reflect the entire school and not just a few exam results. The tables need to incorporate all areas of school life including the quality of the school environment, the support offered to pupils, and other measures of pupil well-being and achievement. The tables need to be a guide only and should not be relied upon solely when choosing a school.
