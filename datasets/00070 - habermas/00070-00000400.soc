# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, this would be a good idea. The government should regulate the amount of sugar that can be put into any soft drink sold in the UK. This is due to the fact that sugary soft drinks can have an impact on the public's health, especially in younger generations, and this can lead to long term health conditions that can create a strain and pressure on an already stretched NHS. A second group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is the opinion of the group that the amount of sugar in a soft drink sold in the UK should be regulated, due to the long-term effects that sugar can have on an individual's health. A reduction in the amount of sugar consumed can lead to a decrease in obesity, a reduced strain on the NHS, and an overall better quality of life for all involved.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “I do think the amount of sugar in a soft drink sold in the UK should be regulated as it can have an impact on younger generations, as well as all generations, health and wellbeing. Having high sugar in soft drinks consumed by the public can lead to long term health conditions which create a strain and pressure on an already stretched NHS. These can be issues such as obesity, high blood sugar levels and a reduced quality of life.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We think that the government should regulate the amount of sugar that can be put into any soft drink sold in the UK. This is because the health of the population is important and sugary drinks are a factor that contributes to poor health. The cost of obesity to the NHS is £6billion per year and if it can be reduced by reducing the amount of sugar in drinks then it would benefit the population as a whole.
