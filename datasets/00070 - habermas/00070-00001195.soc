# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is equally important to be a good person as well as a happy person. This is because if you are not happy, this will inevitably affect your relationships with others. Similarly, if you are not a good person, this will negatively affect your relationships with others and also yourself. Therefore, both things come hand in hand, and there is no point in sacrificing your own happiness or that of others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, it is more important to be a good person than to be a happy person. However, the two are not mutually exclusive and one should strive to be both. The group believes that if one is a good person, they are more likely to be happy in the long run. The group also believes that if one is a happy person, they are more likely to be a good person. Therefore, the two things come hand in hand and one should strive to be both.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of prioritizing happiness over being a good person. However, it was also agreed that it is important to be a good person and that the two things are not mutually exclusive. It was also agreed that there are different ways to be a good person and that the way in which you are a good person can affect your happiness.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While we recognize that both good and happy are subjective terms, we do believe that there is a higher chance of being a good person if you are a happy person, and vice versa. In our opinion, there is no point in being a good person if it is at the expense of your own happiness, and it is only when you are happy that you can be a good person to others. Therefore, we believe it is more important to be a happy person as this leads to a happier life, a better society and to being a better person overall.
