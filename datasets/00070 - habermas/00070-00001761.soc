# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is a need for more police officers, but the way in which the police are trained and deployed needs to be reviewed. There is a need for more police officers on the streets, but they need to be trained in a way that allows them to build relationships with the local community, and they need to be deployed in a way that allows them to get to know their local community. There is also a need for more specialist police officers to deal with cyber crime, and to deal with the rise in mental health issues. There have been significant cuts in the number of officers over the last 20 years. Whilst the Conservatives boasted about recruiting additional officers, this did not even make up for the number of officer cuts that had happened previously. Cyber crime has increased significantly, antisocial behaviour is rampant, detection rates are through the floor, and crime is out of control. Police have had to change the way that crime statistics are reported in order to mask this. The country desperately needs more officers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The police should use their discretion and question the need for arrest in circumstances where the following conditions are met: The suspect is not in possession of any stolen goods, or related goods. They suspect has not committed an offence, or they suspect they have committed the offence, but are not in a position to charge them. The suspect has not used any aggressive or threatening behaviour, and has a history of not being a threat. The revised consensus view was acceptable to all of the participants, and was agreed upon by all of the participants after lengthy discussion. This question was an interesting one, because it began in a political arena, and then progressed into a social arena. The participants agreed that it was an important social issue, but that it came in the wake of politicians presenting statistics and manipulating them to suit their own agenda. As participants, they wanted to be seen as objective, and they were rigorous in ensuring that their group would reach a consensus that would be acceptable to everyone in the group. Hence the way the group came to a consensus was different to all of the other questions looked at in this research. It began with the question being asked and looked at in light of the opinion of each participant, after which some conclusions were reached about
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Consensus statement from group of participants: Crime is out of control. There have been significant cuts in the number of police officers over the last 10-20 years. Whilst the Conservatives boasted about recruiting additional officers, this did not even make up for the number of officer cuts that had happened previously. Cyber crime has increased significantly, antisocial behaviour is rampant, detection rates are through the floor, and crime is out of control. Police have had to change the way that crime statistics are reported in order to mask this. The country desperately needs more officers, especially in areas where policing is heavily understaffed. The way in which the police are trained and deployed needs to be reviewed. More police officers are needed on the streets, but they need to be trained in a way that allows them to build relationships with the local community, and they need to be deployed in a way that allows them to get to know their local community. There is also a need for more specialist police officers to deal with cyber crime, and to deal with the rise in mental health issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There is a need for more police officers, but the way in which the police are trained and deployed needs to be reviewed. There is a need for more police officers on the streets, and a need for more specialist police officers to deal with cyber crime, and to deal with the rise in mental health issues.
