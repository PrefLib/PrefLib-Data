# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Scotland should be an independent country, however the Scottish Government should also remain responsible for setting the tax rates for their citizens.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although there is already a Scottish Parliament, many laws are still passed by the UK Government in Westminster which do not pay sufficient attention to the impact of the lives of those living in Scotland. This will enable self-determination of its population, which have a more beneficial impact on its economy by expanding Scottish trade.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of devolution of power to regional areas and was in favour of a more self-governing Scotland with its own parliament and laws, which better suited the needs of Scotland. However, the group was divided as to whether Scotland should be independent. The group was aware that many important laws were still passed by the UK government, which did not pay sufficient attention to the needs of those living in Scotland. The group agreed that there would be many benefits to Scotland being independent, however Scotland is already seen as an independent country but being part of the United Kingdom strengthens all countries involved and unites us. It would be a massive shame for both the Scots, and the remaining UK countries. The heritage and history we share is too strong to break bonds.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be an independent Scotland. However, it is important to note that there was a lot of disagreement within the group over this matter and that their final conclusion should be seen as the best possible solution they could come up with.
