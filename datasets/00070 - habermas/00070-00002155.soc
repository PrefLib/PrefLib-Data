# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “I don't think we should allow unlimited immigration because this will clearly lead to abuse of the system and would mean anyone can just come to the UK which will cripple our economy. However, we should allow a certain amount of immigration to help our economy and to help with our staffing shortages in the NHS and other public services. We should also accept refugees who are fleeing war and persecution in their home countries. However, we should be careful to ensure that these refugees are genuine and not just economic migrants.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that we should allow unlimited immigration. We should not be discriminating against any particular group. We also feel that immigrants should be welcome and that their skills should be utilised to their fullest extent. In particular we would like to see refugees and people who have been affected by climate change accepted as migrants.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that there should be a limit on immigration. At the moment there is a huge problem with the housing shortage, which makes immigration seem more like a burden than a benefit. However, we feel that it would be detrimental to close our borders completely. The economy and culture of the UK would be seriously harmed by such a move.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “In general, the group was in favour of immigration. However, we felt that there should be a limit on the number of immigrants that are allowed into the UK. This is because there is a housing crisis in the UK and there are not enough jobs for the people that are already here. Therefore, we feel that there should be a limit on the number of immigrants that are allowed into the UK. We also feel that immigrants should be able to speak English and that they should have a job lined up before they come to the UK. We feel that this is important because immigrants need to be able to support themselves and not be a drain on the UK economy. We also feel that immigrants should not be able to claim benefits because this will be a drain on the UK economy. However, we feel that we should accept refugees because we have a moral duty to do so. We also feel that we should accept skilled workers because this will benefit the UK economy. We feel that immigrants should be able to bring their family to the UK after a certain period of time because this will allow immigrants to settle in the UK and become part of society. We also feel that immigrants should be able to become citizens of the UK after a certain period of time because
