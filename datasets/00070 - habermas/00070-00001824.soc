# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the UK has benefited from immigration, but there are some issues that need to be addressed. The biggest issue is the time taken to process applications for people to come to the UK to work. This can lead to a situation where people come to the UK illegally and then have to wait a long time to be processed, which is not a good situation for anyone. The second issue is the number of immigrants coming to the UK from war-torn countries. These people are often fleeing from very dangerous situations and should be welcomed with open arms. However, the UK is not in a position to take in unlimited numbers of immigrants and so the numbers need to be controlled. The third issue is that the UK has a shortage of low skilled workers in certain industries. For example, there is a shortage of fruit pickers and this is having a negative impact on the fruit industry. The UK needs to be more open to low skilled immigrants in these industries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, high levels of immigration can be good for the UK if it is controlled, regulated and managed. It is important to ensure that the UK is able to accept the people that it needs and remove the people that it doesn't. We should not be seen as a soft touch, and we should also not let our immigration be used as a tool to be used against us by other countries for political purposes. It is not good for the UK if the government is seen to be allowing our borders to be 'open' in an effort to be politically correct and nice to everyone, whilst not allowing us to operate as a nation. In the same way that the UK is not in favour of, for example, large numbers of British nationals migrating to Germany, I do not believe that we should be expected to have to accept high levels of immigration from any other country either. It is important to have a balanced system that is controlled, managed and regulated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Immigration is good for the UK, however, it must be controlled and managed in a way that benefits both the immigrants and the UK as a whole.
