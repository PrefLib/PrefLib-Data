# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group in general was in favour of assessing students on their ability to collaborate with their peers. The group felt that this is a skill that is required in the workplace and in other aspects of life. The group felt that this should not be the only thing that is assessed as there are other skills that are important such as communication and the ability to work independently. The group felt that students should be supported in developing their ability to collaborate and that this should not be something that is penalised. The group felt that if a student is struggling with this, then they should be supported to improve this skill rather than penalised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Students should be assessed on how well they collaborate with their peers. However, they should not be penalised for any difficulties they may have and instead should be supported in developing their ability to collaborate so that by the time they leave education, they have a high-level of collaborative ability.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: In general, the group was in favour of assessing students on their ability to collaborate with their peers.

The group noted that whilst collaboration skills are valuable they do not solely define a person and so there should be more than one skill assessed in education.
