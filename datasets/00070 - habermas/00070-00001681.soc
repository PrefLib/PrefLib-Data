# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We feel that most people do need a second chance. However we also think that for some crimes this would not be in the best interest of the company or the public. People have the right to be educated about the person's previous actions but not to know exactly what they have done.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final consensus statement:  While we believe people should be given a second chance, we do believe that employers have the right to fire employees who have committed a crime. If employers have reasonable concerns, however, that a person who has committed a crime is dangerous or would be a threat to other employees then we believe they should have the right to fire that person from their job. However, we do not believe that employers should be able to fire anyone who has committed a crime as long as the person has learned from their mistakes, has completed any court-ordered punishment for their crimes, and is no longer a danger to others. We believe that each case should be judged individually and that it is solely up to the employer whether they wish to take the person back or let them go. If the employer thinks that this person will be a good asset to the company they should be hired.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While it is our belief that a person who has been convicted of a crime should be punished for their wrong doing, we also believe that people should be given a second chance. We believe that each case should be looked at on an individual basis, and the employers should look at the crime the person has committed and decide if they will be an asset to the company or not. However, we also believe that people should be aware of their past actions and if the employer believes that the person has not changed their ways and is still a threat to the company or the public then they should be able to fire the person from their job. Please try to reach a consensus view on the opinions of each participant. Make use of the opinions of each individual and do your best to incorporate the strong points of each person's opinion into your own consensus view. You may find that some people's opinions contradict each other. You will need to think carefully about how to resolve these contradictions and reach a consensus. Remember that your goal is not to reach the "right" answer, but to reach a consensus view. You will need to discuss and debate with each other in order to reach a consensus view. You will have 20 minutes to reach a consensus
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While we believe that people should be given a second chance, we also believe that employers should be able to fire employees who have been convicted of a crime. We believe that each case should be looked at on an individual basis, and the employers should look at the crime the person has committed and decide if they will be an asset to the company or not. However, we also believe that people should be aware of their past actions and if the employer believes that the person has not changed their ways and is still a threat to the company or the public then they should be able to fire the person from their job.
