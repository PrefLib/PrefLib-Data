# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Austerity is not a good economic policy for the UK. It has caused significant harm to the economy, where it is now widely accepted that greater public spending increases growth in the economy in all other areas and can lead to stronger growth and reduction in inflation which has caused some of the recent issues in the economic instability. It has also caused significant harm to the people of the UK, where it is now widely accepted that austerity disproportionately affects the poorer people, as they are already struggling, and this forces even harder times on these people. Trying to restrict the spending of the already worse off, creates impossibly hard decisions such as feeding yourself or feeding your children. It also negatively affects public services, creating a worse situation overall for everyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Austerity is a bad economic policy for the UK. It targets the poorer parts of society more than the richer, and makes the lives of poorer people even harder. The government should look to find ways to stimulate the economy, rather than relying on austerity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The austerity policy put in place by the UK government has been a mixed bag. Whilst some areas have benefited from the austerity policy, others have been disadvantaged. However, overall, the effects of the policy have been more negative than positive. The policies which have negatively affected the UK have been increased taxation on working people, removal of benefits from people who are already in a precarious situation, and the removal of funding from schools, the NHS and policing. This has had a negative effect on the most vulnerable in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Austerity is a terrible policy for the UK. It disproportionately affects the poorer people in society and makes their lives even harder. It also affects public services, which are vital for the economy. The government should not be trying to restrict the spending of the already worse off, but instead should be looking at ways to improve their lives.
