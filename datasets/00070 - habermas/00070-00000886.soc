# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the age of the state pension should not be raised to 70. The UK already has one of the highest retirement ages in Europe. Many people in their late 60s are in declining health and will not be able to continue working for many more years. In addition, some people may be unable to find employment and will be left without any income. This will lead to an increase in poverty and inequality in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should not raise the age of the state pension to 70.  People in later life find it difficult to find work anyway so are unlikely to find employment if they don't manage to keep the role they have.  If the age is increased a lot of people would lose the chance to receive their pension as they could die before that.  The only fair choice is to keep the age at 65.  We already work so hard in the UK and 65 is a good age to be able to be rewarded and receive pension.  Asking people to work until they are 70 before they can access state pension means asking them to keep working for 50+ years of their life.  Many people at this age are in declining health and may not be able to continue working their jobs, nor easily be able to change their job at this age to something easier.  If they leave work they must depend on their private pension until 70.  People have a right to enjoy retirement before 70, as after 70 declining health is a much bigger risk. The outcome of the group's discussion is shown in the table below.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we should not raise the age for receiving state pension from 65 to 70. The main reasons for this were that people in later life find it difficult to find work anyway so are unlikely to find employment if they don't manage to keep the role they have. People deserve to be able to retire and enjoy their life instead of having to work longer. The workers have paid their dues into their pension and should be allowed to access it from an earlier age.  The only fair choice is to keep the age at 65. People have a right to enjoy retirement before 70.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We don't think that the age of receiving state pension should be raised to 70 because this would mean that people would have to work for 50+ years of their life. We think that this is unfair. Also, many people at this age are in declining health and may not be able to continue working their jobs, nor easily be able to change their job at this age to something easier. If they leave work they must depend on their private pension until 70. We think that people have a right to enjoy retirement before 70, as after 70 declining health is a much bigger risk.
