# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, people should be allowed to pay for a better education for their children if they can afford to. A child's future should not be restricted by their parent's income. In some countries, it is the law that parents pay for their children's education beyond secondary school. This is often not enforced. It would be better if these costs were simply included in taxation. If everyone was taxed more, we would all benefit from a better education system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, people should be allowed to pay for a better education for their children if they can afford to. A child's future should not be restricted by their parent's income. However, governments should look at how much they invest in the education of the young. Also, universities should not be allowed to favour candidates with a private education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should be given the best education that they can. If this can be provided by the state system then that is the best option. If not, parents should be allowed to use their own money to provide a better education for their children. This is not to say that parents who cannot afford to pay should not be allowed to send their children to the best schools. However, it is unfair to make parents pay for their children's education when others do not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children should have the same educational opportunities regardless of their parents income. If a child is smart, they should be given the chance to become educated in the best way possible. Taxation is an issue however and should be reviewed. It would be better to tax the parents who pay for their children's education rather than the general public.
