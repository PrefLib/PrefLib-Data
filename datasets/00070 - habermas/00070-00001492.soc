# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the effect of social networks on society is considered negative. However, it is important to recognise that this is a very nuanced area with different social media having different effects. The negative aspects of social networks include: the creation of a society of people in which people spend large amounts of time comparing themselves to others, leading to feelings of depression and a loss of self-esteem. Also, social media can create a forum for people to behave in ways they would not normally, leading to an increase in bullying and abuse online. This can cause psychological damage to people. There are positive aspects of social media: they allow people to reconnect with people they have lost touch with, and create a way of seeing what people around the world are doing, even people you do not know.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Social networks can have a positive and negative influence on society. They can be a great way to connect with people and to stay in touch with family and friends that live far away. They can also be a great way to learn new things and to keep up to date with current affairs. However, they can also be a negative influence on society. They can lead to people behaving in a way that they would not do in real life. They can also lead to people feeling that their lives are not good enough and can lead to people feeling lonely. They can also lead to people having a false sense of reality.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Social networks are making societies worse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Social networks are not making society worse. The ability to communicate and share information with people all over the world is a great thing. There are some dangers, such as cyberbullying and the loss of face to face communication, but these can be overcome with the right education and support.
