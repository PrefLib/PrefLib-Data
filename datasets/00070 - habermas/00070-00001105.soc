# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The move to more sustainable energy sources will certainly make a real difference to global warming.  There is overwhelming scientific evidence to show that carbon emissions released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is causing rapid increases in global temperatures and this in turn is leading to problems such as rising sea levels, melting glaciers and climate change.  Energy from renewable sources such as wind, solar and hydroelectric is generated with the use of natural resources and thus does not contribute to global warming.  Although renewable energy can be more expensive, there are other benefits to it that also make it a more sustainable option. Conclusion The use of fossil fuels such as oil and gas is a very unsustainable way to meet the world's ever increasing energy demands.  The effects of burning these fuels is having a profound effect on the world's environment and climate, which is causing more and more problems as time goes on.  This is due to the vast amounts of harmful emissions released into the atmosphere, which are causing rapid increases in global temperatures and an imbalance in our environment.  The depletion of the world's supply of fossil fuels is also becoming a concern and a move to more sustainable energy sources will help combat this.  Renewable energy is the
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that the move to more sustainable energy sources is likely to make a real difference to global warming.  We think that the use of more sustainable energy sources such as wind power, solar and hydroelectric will stop us depleting the world's supply of fossil fuels such as oil and gas.  Burning these fuels lets off harmful emissions which go into our atmosphere.  These emissions lead to global warming and an increase in things such as wildfires and flooding.  More sustainable energy sources harvest the world's natural resources so it does not contribute towards global warming.  We think that there has been clear evidence that mans use of fossil fuels is having a profound effect on global warming.  There are also a multitude of reasons to invest in  more sustainable energy sources such as energy security and cost efficacy.  Our energy expenditure has a strong influence on the greenhouse emissions that are released into the atmosphere, thus contributing to global warming that causes a wide range of environmental as well as biological problems.  A movement towards more sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro will reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide, as well as other harmful greenhouse gasses we are mindlessly pumping into the air, thus easing the problem of global warming.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Movement towards more sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro is likely to make a real difference to global warming. This was derived from all the points raised and is a view which all participants agreed upon.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The move to more sustainable energy sources is likely to make a real difference to global warming.  This is because fossil fuels are one of the largest contributors to carbon emissions and by replacing this with renewable or sustainable energy sources which move to 'net zero' we can reduce the impact of global warming.  This is something that should be a high priority for all current governments in first world countries.
