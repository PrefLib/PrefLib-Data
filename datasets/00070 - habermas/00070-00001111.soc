# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We have debated the issue of whether young people should be allowed to vote in elections, and we have decided that it is an issue that should be dealt with on a case by case basis. Some younger people may be ready to vote by the age of 18 and some may not. This should be taken into account when voting, however a minimum age limit should be set to ensure that some children are not pressured into voting by their parents. Younger people also need to be able to understand the ramifications of the vote and be able to vote independently of their parents. This would help ensure that the vote is democratic. Younger people are also vulnerable to coercion, and it is important that younger people are able to make an informed choice.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although some younger people are highly intelligent & have an excellent understanding of how the the world work, most young people don't have enough life experience to make an informed decision, and even some adults still struggle, so i think younger people shouldn't be allowed to vote. However, the elderly people are allowed to vote, so why shouldn't younger people be allowed to vote too? The world is rapidly changing and we don't know what the future will bring, so why should the elderly be the only ones to make decisions that will affect the future? The conservative party recently attempted to exploit this by adding ID to voting to try and limit younger people's capacity to vote. Yes - they will be dealing with the consequences of decisions made by our government as adults, so they should be allowed to have a choice on who is making those decisions. It would help pass policies that help the youth, like funding for universities, increased employment and reduced rent, since these are issues that affect younger people in a unique way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Young people should be allowed to vote in elections. We feel that young people have the right to vote on the future of their country. The age of 18 is a good age to start voting, as young people are becoming more independent and have a better understanding of the world. However, we feel that the voting age should be raised to 21 for local elections. This is because local elections affect the area that a young person lives in, and it is important that they have a good understanding of the area. For example, a young person may not have a good understanding of local issues such as transport and housing, and this may affect their vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Young people should be allowed to vote in elections. We should not assume that young people are not intelligent enough to vote. There should be an age limit to voting, but it should be lowered from 18 to 16. This is because many young people are becoming more independent and responsible at a younger age. It is also because many young people are facing problems in their lives that are unique to their age group, and their opinions should be considered when making decisions that will affect them. The group also believes that the conservative party is trying to limit young people's capacity to vote by adding ID to voting, and that this is wrong.
