# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Water is an essential requirement for survival and so we need to make sure it is available to all. By having the government raking over the supply of water, the government can ensure that quality is never sacrificed for cost and ensure that consumers do not pay too much to get water supplied to them as profit will not be one of the many driving force for government. Water is an essential requirement in people's lives today as it is one essential thing for survival. Private companies are known to always be profit driven and would go to any length to maximize their profits which will often include rise in cost to the consumers, or reduction in quality to meet rising production cost. Having government taking over the supply of such important requirement for life will help to ensure that quality is never sacrificed for cost and ensure that consumers do not pay too much to get water supplied to them as profit will not one of the many driving force for government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should not take over water supplies from private companies. The private companies have the expertise to deal with the water supply, and the government does not.

The government can ensure that quality is never sacrificed for cost and ensure that consumers do not pay too much to get water supplied to them as profit will not one of the many driving force for government. The government can also ensure that the water supply is not monopolized by a few companies and that water is made available to all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the government should not take over water supplies from private companies because private companies are in the business to make money, and are more efficient than the government in their operations, which in turn means lower cost to the consumer. The government is better suited to regulating and ensuring that water companies are doing a good job in providing their services. However, if a water company is providing sub-par service to the consumers, such as not providing clean drinking water, or not providing adequate water to meet demand, then the government should step in and take over the company to ensure that its citizens are not suffering. On the other hand, private companies are more profit driven than the government, so they may have an incentive to charge high prices to the consumers, especially when they have a monopoly on water supply in an area. This is a good reason for the government to step in and regulate the water companies and ensure that prices are fair and reasonable.
