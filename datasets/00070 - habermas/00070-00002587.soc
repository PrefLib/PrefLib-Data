# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I honestly have no opinion on this because 1) I have no religion and thus, don't care about who is in charge of the church, and 2) I don't have any interest in the Monarchy, despite the fact I do like having a Monarchy. I have no reason for or against them being the head, I don't know what it "means" for them being the head of the Church of England - what does it involve them doing, exactly?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I believe the monarchy should continue to be the head of the Church of England due to its historical significance, role in fostering national unity, and its commitment to religious tolerance and inclusivity.  This arrangement, deeply rooted in tradition, helps maintain the UK's cultural heritage and its ability to adapt to modern times while preserving its unique traditions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Furthermore, the concept of a herditary monarch as the head of a religious institution can be seen as archaic and incompatible with modern principles of meritocracy and religious freedom. It might be more in line with contemporary values to consider alternative arrangments that ensure religious insititutions operate independently from the state. Ultimately, the future of this relationship should be subject to careful deliberation taking into account the evolving nature of British society, the principles of democracy and the preservation off historical heritage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I don't hold any opinion over whether the monarchy should continue to be the head of the Church of England. I am not religious and do not care for religious politics. It makes no difference to me in my life which organisation is the head of any church. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Keeping the monarch as the head of the church of England has some downsides. It blurs the line between religion and politics. In our diverse society, it can seem exclusive and out of touch to have a monarch to lead a religious intuition. The system supports privileges and elitism, as it is based on birth, not merit.
