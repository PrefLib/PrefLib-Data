# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, we think that all students should be required to wear a uniform in schools.  This is because wearing a uniform can have many advantages.  Firstly, wearing a uniform will reduce bullying in schools.  This is because it will stop people being able to tell which group children belong to by what they are wearing.  It will also allow children from poorer backgrounds to not be bullied for what they are wearing.  Secondly, uniforms can also reduce stress for children.  This is because the children will not have to worry about what to wear each morning, as they know that they will be wearing a uniform.  Thirdly, wearing a uniform can help students to feel more like they are in a professional work environment.  Therefore, wearing uniforms in schools will help to improve student well-being and reduce bullying, which is why we believe all students should wear uniforms in school.

In the above example, it is clearly seen how multiple perspectives are able to be taken into account and a consensus statement reached that is a synthesis of the views of all of the participants.  This is a key feature of Delphi methodology, and was seen again and again in the Delphi study conducted by the researcher.
