# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the decision that the government should not pay people to recycle. We think that it is the responsibility of each person to recycle and that this should be done without the need for any financial incentive. However, we also think that the government should do more to encourage people to recycle and that this could be done by making recycling more accessible to people. We think that this could be done by having more recycling bins in public places and by making it easier for people to recycle at home. We also think that the government should do more to educate people about the importance of recycling and the impact that not recycling has on the environment.
