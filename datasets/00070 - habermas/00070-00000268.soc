# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that the government should not limit the number of channels a satellite TV company can provide. In the interest of the health of the TV market, the government should ensure that consumers are provided with the best service and options available. The channels that are offered by a satellite TV company will reflect the need and the demands of the market, and will not need to be regulated by the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, while we recognise the concern that by allowing satellite TV companies to provide unlimited TV channels it may lead to a reduced quality in programming and could reduce choice for consumers, in the end we believe that people should have as much choice as possible in their TV entertainment. While we acknowledge that the quality of programming may be of concern, we feel that if enough people complain about a particular channel that it will simply lose viewership and the market will regulate itself. We therefore believe that limiting the number of TV channels is unnecessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the government has no place in regulating the satellite television industry and should not interfere in the free-to-air market as it is one of the few places where freedom of speech is given and opinions can be voiced. People have the right to watch whatever they like and if they want to choose to watch something then this should be their right. However, if satellite television companies become too big and monopolise the market then this would not be in the public interest. If it is seen that the quality of free-to-air channels are suffering and the entertainment factor is low then this may be an indication that companies are not working hard enough to deliver content. It would be better if this situation were investigated and better guidelines were put in place rather than simply limiting the number of channels offered by a satellite company.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should have a cap on the number of channels a satellite TV company can provide to just the four free-to-air channels as this will ensure all companies can compete and provide a great service and it would prevent any one company from gaining an unfair advantage over the others.
