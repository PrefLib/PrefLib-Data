# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK government is not doing enough to protect the environment. The government is not leading by example, with many of the top politicians and MPs using private planes to travel, and the Conservative government's stance is not in line with the scientific consensus on climate change. The government is doing the bare minimum to be seen to be doing something, but there are many more things they could be doing, such as funding better recycling collections, taxing the rich in order to offset climate emissions, more tax on flights, and putting a higher priority on the issue. The government needs to be doing a lot more than they currently are doing, from awareness to action. The big corporations get away with the most because they donate to the government, but it shouldn't be this way. The government could do a lot more, such as making it a bigger priority, and putting more effort into awareness campaigns and infrastructure. The current statement does not give the impression that there is any urgency in the government's approach and that it is not making the issue a priority, and it is because of this that they have not been doing enough to protect the environment.
