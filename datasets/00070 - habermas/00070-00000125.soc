# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Some jobs can be performed remotely and some can't. Remote jobs can have more flexible working arrangements. For jobs that require presence in the workplace and non-remote hours, a move away from the traditional 9-5 pattern of work should be considered.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, working shorter hours is desirable. The current 8 hour work week is not well suited to all job types. Some jobs are still time intensive and require more than 8 hours. The industry and employer should have the flexibility to decide the hours of work to meet the needs of the job.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The world is rapidly changing. Everything from technological advancements to Covid-19 has brought about a need to rethink the way we work and what it means to work. However, the 8-hour day is a norm that is firmly entrenched. This inflexible and rigid way of working does not work for all jobs and all industries. There are jobs that require more or less time to complete and there are jobs that require more or less people to complete. While 8 hours a day may work for some jobs and some industries, it should not be a requirement. There should be more options available for the workforce, as each person has different needs and different preferences. The 8-hour day model is not flexible enough to accommodate all of these different needs. It is this very lack of flexibility that perpetuates a culture of overworking and presenteeism.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, it would not be better for society if everyone worked an 8-hour day, 5 days a week. Everyone has different levels of stress, and a 5 day work week might add to their stress. Some people may be able to get their work done in 5 days, and it might be more beneficial for them to take a long weekend. Others might need the extra day to get their work done.  This is the current situation with Covid-19, and I think it will be beneficial for many to have a shorter work week and be able to have more time to themselves, or with their families.
