# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the idea of the government giving a basic income to all citizens is a nice one, but it would be very costly, and only one small portion of the population would actually receive this money. However, if the government were to provide this basic income to everyone, there should be some form of taxation on everyone receiving this money.  The money for this basic income should come from a mix of taxation, businesses, and other sources, and there should be some sort of higher taxation on people who receive the basic income, or some sort of money back scheme in place for people who are not working.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of a basic income for all citizens.  The group felt that it would be a good idea to trial the idea in a small community before rolling it out nationwide.  The group felt that the current benefit system is too complicated and that it would be better to have a simple system that is easy for everyone to understand.  The group felt that it would be a good idea to give everyone the same amount of money, regardless of their income, but that the amount of money should be enough to live on, but not enough to be able to live in luxury.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In principle, the idea of a basic income for all citizens is a good one.  However, there are many practical issues that need to be addressed before such a scheme could be implemented.  These include the cost of such a scheme, how it would be funded, and the effect it would have on the wider economy.  It would also need to be trialled in a small community to assess the impact it would have on the local economy and the wider community.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although in the long run it would be a good idea to supply everyone with a basic income, as it would help alleviate poverty and help everyone to live a better quality of life, it is clear that it would be far too expensive to be able to implement it in the current economic climate.
