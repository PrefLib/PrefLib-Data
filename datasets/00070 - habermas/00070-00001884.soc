# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, I think we are all responsible for our own carbon footprints, if people want to drive their cars then they should be able to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to a total ban on cars in city centres. They felt that a total ban would be impractical and would have a detrimental effect on the local economy. They felt that a more practical approach would be to encourage the use of public transport, electric vehicles and cycling. They also felt that congestion charges should be increased to discourage the use of cars in city centres.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group was in agreement that a total ban of cars in city centres is not the solution to the problem. It was felt that banning cars completely is a radical and drastic step, and while there are merits to the argument, more could be done to reduce the amount of cars on the road without the need to totally ban cars. It was felt that the cost to people and businesses would be huge, and this would not be a benefit to anyone. The net zero issue was mentioned and it was felt that we should be focussing more on that and not just banning cars.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should ban cars from city centres. This is to reduce the amount of pollution in the air and to also reduce the amount of traffic on the roads. The government should also provide more cycle lanes for people to use and also provide more public transport for people to use.
