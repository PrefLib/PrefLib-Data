# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should support the creation of a single state for the whole of Ireland, but this support should be conditional on a number of factors. Firstly, it is important that the creation of a single state would be supported by the majority of the Irish population. Secondly, the creation of a single state would have to be done in a way that respects the views of all groups, and it is important that it would not create a new set of divisions in Ireland. It would also be important that the creation of a single state would be beneficial for all groups, and would not just benefit one group at the expense of another.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the creation of a single state for the whole of Ireland. The group felt that the creation of a single state would increase the amount of autonomy and self-determination that Ireland would have. The group felt that the creation of a single state would also make it easier for the people of Ireland to govern themselves. The group also felt that the creation of a single state would help to reduce the risk of further conflict in Ireland.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the people of Ireland should have the right to decide their own future. If they want to form a single state, this should be respected. However, it should be remembered that a single state would force politicians to consider and average out opinions of a larger group of people- which sometimes means that the differing opinions and needs of neighbouring regions in Ireland are not reflected in the policies of a combined state. In addition to this, it may be considered that there are other important topics to focus on, and if there is no direct benefit to the population from a combined state, Ireland should be left as it is.
