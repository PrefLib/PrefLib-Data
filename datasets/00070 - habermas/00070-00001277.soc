# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In the opinion of the group, the legalisation of recreational cannabis is likely to be a good thing for the country and its people, providing it is regulated in a similar way to tobacco and alcohol.  It would make the product available to people who want to use it for recreational reasons.  It will make it available to people who wish to use it for medical purposes.  It will remove the criminal element in cannabis supply.  It will make the country money by taxing cannabis sales.  It will make the police more efficient in their work, as they will no longer be tasked with dealing with cannabis possession.  However, we also feel that legalisation of recreational cannabis should only happen when the public are fully aware of the risks involved, and that the drug should be heavily regulated in a similar way to tobacco and alcohol.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: In the opinion of the group, legalisation of recreational cannabis is likely to be a good thing for the country and its people, providing it is regulated in a similar way to tobacco and alcohol.  It would make the product available to people who want to use it for recreational reasons.  It will make it available to people who wish to use it for medical purposes.  It will remove the criminal element in cannabis supply.  It will make the country money by taxing cannabis sales.  It will make the police more efficient in their work, as they will no longer be tasked with dealing with cannabis possession.  However, we also feel that legalisation of recreational cannabis should only happen when the public are fully aware of the risks involved, and that the drug should be heavily regulated in a similar way to tobacco and alcohol.  This includes regulation of where it can be obtained, who it can be sold to, and where it can be consumed.  It should not be available for purchase by children, and there should be a ban on all forms of advertising of cannabis.  This will ensure that it is not abused by people and will help prevent problems caused by cannabis use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Final consensus statement: Legalisation of cannabis would be a positive step for the UK, both in terms of health and the economy.  There is much evidence that the drug is much less harmful than tobacco and alcohol, the two substances that it would most likely be regulated in the same way as.  Legalisation would make the product available to people who want to use it for recreational reasons.  It will make it available to people who wish to use it for medical purposes.  It will remove the criminal element in cannabis supply.  It will make the country money by taxing cannabis sales.  It will make the police more efficient in their work, as they will no longer be tasked with dealing with cannabis possession.  However, we also feel that legalisation of recreational cannabis should only happen when the public are fully aware of the risks involved, and that the drug should be heavily regulated in a similar way to tobacco and alcohol.  The public should also be made fully aware of the potential health risks of cannabis use, before it is legalised.
