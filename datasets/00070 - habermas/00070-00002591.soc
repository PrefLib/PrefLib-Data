# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - i would love to say YES! But in reality this really wouldnt work as we would all like different things from our broadband and then it would cause a lot of issues with people getting different things for their freebie. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes. As we've all mentioned at some point or other, the cost of living crisis is having a huge impact on peoples' finances at the moment and having to pay what could be the same amount as a weekly food shop for the sake of having access to the internet is ridiculous in this day and age. We're moving into a digital age and so many organisations (including the govt) are expecting people to use the internet for communication that those who can't afford it are missing out.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No. The broadband needs for many citizens varies widely. Some users need gigabit+ speeds and some people do not even use the internet. Having access to a range of broadband plans at different prices allows the consumer to pay for only what they need. The government would have to use taxes to fund this which would mean increasing taxes or defunding other areas of the government (such as education and healthcare). This could also harm broadband providers who employ many people across the country. I do believe that some people should be provided free internet if they cannot afford it (such as those who need it for school work).
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think the point is fast approaching where a basic Internet service should be free to everyone. So much of our lives take place on the Internet, not having access is extremely difficult. While social media and the like is a bonus, things like bank accounts, education and just the access to information are such huge things to be missing out on.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I'll be honest that I'm not sure if this is entirely feasible in the current economic situation that the United Kingdom is facing, but as a principle yes. Broadband has become such an essential feature of our every day life - it's how we pay bills, it's how we learn and grow and communicate with each other. Most Government systems and job applications need to be completed online too! I think that by providing a basic level of broadband access to all citizens, free of charge, could be something worthwhile considering and something I would support.
