# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Animal fur should not be sold if it causes pain or suffering for animals in any way. We should ban the sale of animal fur derived from animals that are verified to be endangered especially. This is cruel, a lack of respect to animals and animal lovers, a clear degradation, immorally wrong, and is clearly a vanity thing. Animals deserve to be shown a great deal of respect, they deserve to live and thrive on this planet just as much as humans, and are a vital aspect of the environment and ecosystem of planet Earth. Some of these animals are killed just for this vanity aspect, and this is a big taboo and topic that should enrage the human aspect of people. Using animal fur is an outdated practice and isn't necessary when faux fur can be made to look the same. The process of collecting animal fur is unethical and is a form of animal abuse, and can't be justified for the use in clothing, false eyelashes etc. There are suitable alternatives so continuing to sell animal fur is wrong and not necessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that some types of animal fur should be banned. We feel that we have come to this view for a number of reasons. Some types of animal fur are more expensive than synthetic alternatives, and these are often made to look identical. The reasons why people would choose real animal fur over faux fur are unclear. There is a cruelty aspect to some methods of collecting fur, and this is morally wrong. The use of animal fur for vanity reasons should be outlawed. Many types of animals that provide fur are in danger of becoming extinct, and this use of their bodies for vanity products is a contributing factor. For all these reasons, we have decided that certain types of animal fur should be banned.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Animal fur should not be sold if it causes pain or suffering for animals in any way. This is the only opinion that was agreed upon by all participants.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that we should ban the sale of animal fur, and that there is no justification for it, given the existence of synthetic alternatives that are essentially indistinguishable from animal fur. This is a cruel practice that has no place in a civilized society, and that shows respect for the well-being of animals.
