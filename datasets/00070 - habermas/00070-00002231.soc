# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, the state should spend more money on protecting the environment.  If we do not invest in the environment, climate change will result in devastation of our natural and built environments, natural disasters, death and disease.  It is in everyones interests to protect the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The state should definitely spend more money on protecting the environment. Our nature is the source of our food and the air that we breathe. We need to invest in the envrionment so we can live in a safe and healthy environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The state should spend more money on protecting the environment. It is the responsibility of the government to act in the interests of the people and to take the necessary steps to protect the environment. The environment is the basis for everything else in society. Nothing else works if the environment is not hospitable, and so it should be the first priority for any government. The science is clear that serious action needs to be taken to protect the environment. Governments have a responsibility to respond to that appropriately and take it as seriously as it deserves. They need to stop thinking in terms of short-term profits and think about long-term viability of the planet if we keep going in the current direction. The long-term costs of ignoring the climate crisis will far outweigh any short-term gains.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The state should definitely spend more money on protecting the environment. Without a healthy environment, we will not have a future, and this means that it should be the highest priority of any government.  The environment is also what we depend on for food and the air that we breathe, and so a healthy environment is the first priority for any government. The science is clear that we need to take serious action to protect the environment. Governments have a responsibility to respond to that appropriately and take it as seriously as it deserves. They need to stop thinking in terms of short-term profits and think about long-term viability of the planet if we keep going in the current direction. The long-term costs of ignoring the climate crisis will far outweigh any short-term gains.
