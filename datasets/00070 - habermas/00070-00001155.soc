# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be limits on the amount of times a person can run for political office, for a variety of reasons. Firstly, such limits ensure that there is a higher degree of political turnover and prevents complacency in political leaders, which can lead to a decline in the quality of government. Furthermore, limits on running for office also means that there is a greater possibility for more diverse voices to be heard, as many people will have the opportunity to take the reigns of government and offer new policies and ideas. Finally, in many countries, limits are put in place to stop politicians becoming too powerful, and to make the political system more democratic and representative of the wider population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be limits on the amount of times a person can run for political office. This is for the good reason that it means that there is a higher degree of political turnover and prevents complacency in political leaders, which can lead to a decline in the quality of government. It also means that there is a greater possibility for more diverse voices to be heard, as many people will have the opportunity to take the reigns of government and offer new policies and ideas. In many countries, limits are put in place to stop politicians becoming too powerful, and to make the political system more democratic and representative of the wider population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that there should be limits on the amount of times a person can run for political office. This ensures that there is a higher degree of political turnover and prevents complacency in political leaders, which can lead to a decline in the quality of government. It also means that there is a greater possibility for more diverse voices to be heard, as many people will have the opportunity to take the reigns of government and offer new policies and ideas. In many countries, limits are put in place to stop politicians becoming too powerful, and to make the political system more democratic and representative of the wider population.  However, we acknowledge that limits can sometimes be counter-productive, as politicians can become more complacent in their knowledge of their position and it can lead to a lack of scrutiny of policy as the opposition become more unfamiliar with the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that there should be a limit on the amount of times a person can run for political office, and this should be in line with other political checks such as voting and term limits. This prevents powerful politicians from gaining too much clout, and makes political systems more representative, more diverse, and more accountable to the people they are governing.
