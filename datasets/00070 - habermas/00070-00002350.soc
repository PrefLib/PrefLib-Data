# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The majority of participants thought that it is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. The only exception was when it was proposed that discounts could be applied to certain groups, like students, the elderly, or NHS workers, but not a specific age range. The majority of participants also thought that it was not acceptable to increase or decrease prices based on demand or need for the product, but if this is the case, it should be for everyone, otherwise this will lead to increased discrimination which is likely to have the company's profits at heart. It would seem fair to decrease prices for certain demographics where a product may otherwise be too expensive if it should be easily accessible, but in these cases the prices should also be the same for everyone, otherwise it may lead to some individuals having to go without a product that is necessary just based on a demographic that they cannot do anything about in this instance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, it is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. In general, the prices of products should be the same for all customers. This is to ensure that all customers are treated equally and fairly. It is also to ensure that all customers have access to the same products, and that no customer is left out or disadvantaged due to their age or sex. It is also important to note that in some cases, it may be acceptable to offer discounts to certain groups of people. For example, it may be acceptable to offer discounts to students, pensioners, or NHS workers. However, these discounts should be available to all people who fall into these categories, and should not be available to some and not others. It is also important to note that these discounts should be offered due to need, and to ensure that the product is affordable for the customer, and not just to boost profits for the company.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. The issue of gender and age discrimination are very relevant in today's society, and companies should not be allowed to capitalise on this and make profits by charging different prices for different groups of people. There is no difference between a man and a woman, or an old person and a young person, in terms of the price that they pay for a product. It is important that we do not allow companies to dictate prices in this way, as this can lead to a society that is divided and discriminatory. In terms of discounts, it is important that discounts are available to everyone, rather than just to certain groups of people, as this can lead to further discrimination and a society that is divided. The issue of dynamic pricing is also very important and is an issue that companies should not be allowed to use to their advantage and to make profits. Companies should not be allowed to use people's vulnerabilities to their advantage in this way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, it is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. In general, the prices of products should be the same for all customers. This is to ensure that all customers are treated equally and fairly. It is also to ensure that all customers have access to the same products, and that no customer is left out or disadvantaged due to their age or sex. It is also important to note that in some cases, it may be acceptable to offer discounts to certain groups of people. For example, it may be acceptable to offer discounts to students, pensioners, or NHS workers. However, these discounts should be available to all people who fall into these categories, and should not be available to some and not others. It is also important to note that these discounts should be provided for a reason, such as line of work, rather than a blanket due to sex or age.
