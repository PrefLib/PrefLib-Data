# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the consensus that it is important to increase funding to train professional musicians.  The current situation is not adequate and we feel that the government should invest in the future of music in our country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to increasing funding to train professional musicians. However, it was recognised that there may be some benefits to society of having more professional musicians. It was also recognised that some of the participants had not been aware of the topic prior to the group discussion and that this had influenced their opinions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of increasing funding to train professional musicians. The group felt that the current funding levels are adequate and that the government should be focusing on more pressing issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should not increase funding to train professional musicians.  We are in a cost of living crisis and funds should be diverted to where they are most needed. The government wastes enough money on unimportant things. We should drastically reduce wasteful spending and spend more on the things that are truly important.
