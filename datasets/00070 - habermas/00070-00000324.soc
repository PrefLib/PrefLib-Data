# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be some form of abolishment of private schools as the quality of education should be the same across the board. However, this should not be forced and should be implemented over time as a more gradual, phased process. It is important that we have a fair and equitable system that does not separate people at an early age and does not force children to be surrounded by people of similar backgrounds and upbringings.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of abolishing private schools. However, it was recognised that many schools were built as charities, and as such it was not felt that they should be closed down. However, it was felt that private schools should not be allowed to expand further, and all new pupils should be placed in state schools.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Abolishing private schools may be a challenge for the country, however we believe that private schools encourage a hierarchical system that is not necessarily representative of talent. Therefore we believe that private schools should be abolished, especially as they may prevent talented children from other backgrounds to fulfil their potential.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Private schools have a number of pros and cons. The main benefit of private schools is that they can give a greater variety of choice and opportunity to students who wish to explore further into a particular subject or field. They can also create an environment of high-achieving students who are focused on their studies. The negatives of private schools is that they create an even greater gap between rich and poor, and as such increase the level of inequality within society.
