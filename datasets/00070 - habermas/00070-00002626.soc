# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, definitely, particularly after a series of important crises (i.e. economic, immigration, coronavirus, climate) at the domestic and EU level, a top priority of the government would be to allocate more resources to reduce inequality and alleviate those at risk of poverty and social exclusion. A thriving society is a society that respects itself and harnesses the skills and knowledge of its citizens so in this context it is imperative for the government to invite local authorities, academics, researchers, and other stakeholders and public institutions to contribute to a debate and come up with an implementation plan, especially for the under-developed areas of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Absolutely! I believe the government our mostly responsible for financial inequality so they could start there by lowering the tax and price inflation for the working class and making sure those with higher pay packets pay higher tax and do not avoid it. For all inequalities in the Country for the most part it begins and ends with our Government so they should be taking a more active role in reducing it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Absolutely, the Government should be involved in reducing inequality. We live in a multicultural society, and any form of abusive behaviour to anybody needs to be stamped out, whether that's racism, sexism, ableism, or abuse against LGBT community. The Government also should be focussed on supporting the poor people through minimum wages, workers rights and fair tax regimes. Strong support for social workers, NHS workers and anybody in the public sector like teachers has a dramatic effect on the less well off
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: government intervention can help prevent extreme income disparities, contributing to economic stability and reducing the risk of financial crises. Government programs can provide a safety net for vulnerable populations ensuring basic needs like healthcare, education and housing are met. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Yes I believe they should be the driving force to take inequality. I believe everyone should be paid fair wages and have good working conditions for a start. Another issue is the rich are getting richer, and many of whom don't pay their fair share of taxes which we can then reinvest back into the economy
