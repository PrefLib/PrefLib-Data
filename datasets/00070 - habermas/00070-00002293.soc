# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should raise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. This is because they cause issues that cost the NHS millions of pounds every single year. We believe it is fair to raise these taxes as it would help pay for these issues. We also believe that it would put people off buying them. They're both drugs that do damage to the human body so we believe that it should be thought about before you buy them, and making them more expensive would do this. However, we can also see the down-sides to increasing the taxes on them such as people with addictions would need more money to purchase them and in turn could put them in an even worse financial state. It could also cause a rise in underground black markets where they are sold for cheaper, illegally. This would mean that they're not guaranteed to be safe. So overall, we think their price should be raised slightly but not too much.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of raising taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. The majority of participants thought that this would help to reduce the number of people who smoke and drink and would also help to reduce the cost to the NHS of treating the health problems associated with smoking and drinking. However, it was also recognised that this could lead to the creation of black markets for alcohol and cigarettes, which could lead to health problems. The majority of participants also thought that the extra tax revenue should be spent on programmes to help people to stop smoking and drinking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of raising taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. The reasons for this were that they cause harm to health and cost the NHS a lot of money. However, it was also recognised that this would be unfair on people who are addicted to these substances and that it could also lead to an increase in black market sales of these substances. It was suggested that the taxes should be raised but not too much, and that the extra money raised should be spent on programmes to help people stop smoking and drinking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should raise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. This is because they cost society a lot of money in healthcare and policing. We believe that these extra taxes should be spent on programmes to encourage people to stop smoking and to drink less. We think that this idea could be an issue as there are other things, such as unhealthy food, that also cost the NHS money and taxing these may punish certain groups in society, especially those who live in areas with poor quality food shops. However, we think that the price of alcohol and cigarettes should be raised slightly but not too much. This is because we think that it would put people off buying them. They're both drugs that do damage to the human body so we believe that it should be thought about before you buy them, and making them more expensive would do this. However, we can also see the down-sides to increasing the taxes on them such as people with addictions would need more money to purchase them and in turn could put them in an even worse financial state. It could also cause a rise in underground black markets where they are sold for cheaper, illegally. This would mean that they're not guaranteed to be safe.
