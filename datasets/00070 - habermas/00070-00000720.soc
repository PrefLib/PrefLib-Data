# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that a universal basic income should be provided, as it would create a more equal society and provide a safety net for those who might fall on hard times or go through bad financial experiences.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “A universal basic income would be a good thing to implement in society. It would ensure that everyone is on a level playing field and would help to reduce the income inequality gap in society. It would also help to reduce the welfare bill as people would be more incentivised to work. It would also help people who are struggling to get by and help to reduce poverty.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of providing universal basic income, but with some caveats. The consensus view was that if a person is able to work, then they should be required to do so in order to receive the basic income. This would help to reduce the cost of providing the basic income and would also encourage people to work, thus helping to reduce unemployment. It was also suggested that the level of basic income provided should be linked to the cost of living in a particular area, with the level of basic income being higher in areas where the cost of living is higher.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: A universal basic income should be provided as it would provide a safety net for those who might fall on hard times or go through bad financial experiences. The scheme would also provide a more equal starting point for everyone and encourage those on benefits to work as they would be better off. A second group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
