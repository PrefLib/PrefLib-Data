# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should tax people more who produce more pollution. The tax would act as a deterrent and encourage people to find alternative means of producing energy and fuel from fossil fuels. This would be better for the environment and would encourage people to use more renewable and sustainable means of energy. This would also be good for communities as the health of people would be better.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should tax people more who produce more pollution. The issue of pollution is a very real and pressing issue in the world today. Governments and people around the world are starting to realise the damage which is being done to the planet. The planet is in danger of being irreparably damaged. Therefore, we should tax people more who produce more pollution in order to discourage them from polluting the environment and to encourage them to find ways to cut down on pollution and to find more sustainable means of energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should tax people more who produce more pollution. This will discourage people from producing more pollution and will encourage them to find more environmentally friendly ways of living. This will also mean that the government will make more money and can use this to invest in green technology and to promote renewable energy. This will have a positive effect on the environment and will benefit future generations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should tax people more who produce more pollution. This will help to discourage pollution and encourage people to find more sustainable means of energy. We should also provide incentives to people who find more sustainable means of energy. This will help to encourage people to find solutions that are better for the environment.
