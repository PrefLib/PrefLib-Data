# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the UK joining the Eurozone. We had different reasons for wanting to join, and felt that the benefits of joining would outweigh the costs. We felt that it would make the UK economy more stable, improve our international standing and our ability to trade with other countries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is the view of the group that the UK should not join the Eurozone, because it would not be good for the economy and is an overall bad idea. There were a few dissenting voices, who expressed the following views:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “I think that the UK joining the Eurozone would be a very good thing for the economy. We are struggling to deal with inflation and our own devalued currency and being in the Eurozone would mean that the economy would be stable and would have the ability to grow in a healthy way. The only issue I can see is that if the Eurozone were to collapse, the UK would also be dragged down with it, however I think that if we joined now, when things are looking up, it would be a good idea and we would not have to worry about the collapse of the Eurozone.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should join the Eurozone as it will increase stability and jobs and also increase the UK's involvement with the EU.
