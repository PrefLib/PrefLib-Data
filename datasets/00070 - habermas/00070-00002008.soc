# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The education system should be focused on creative thinking and less focused on memorising facts. The current education system focuses on a narrow range of subjects, memorisation and testing of knowledge. However, these subjects are becoming less relevant in today’s world. There are a wide variety of careers that require creative thinkers. In order for children to be prepared for life, they must learn how to think creatively. If a child can think creatively they will be able to achieve more, and have a more balanced approach to life and learning. Memorising facts is something which can be done at any time. The current education system is pushing children to remember and learn facts which can then be tested. This can cause anxiety for many children and is not the best way of learning. If children were able to learn in a more creative and inspiring way, then they will be more engaged and excited to learn. The focus on creativity and being inspired will support children to develop themselves and achieve the best results in life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The education system needs to change in order to be relevant to the current world and prepare children for their lives ahead.  The system is too focused on teaching factual information and testing this information which can lead to children feeling stressed and anxious. The system needs to be changed to focus more on creative thinking and to inspire children to explore new ideas. The system needs to be changed in order to support children to enjoy learning and to prepare them for the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: We believe that the education system should be more focused on creative thinking and less focused on memorising facts. In order to be prepared for life, children must learn creative thinking as this is a way of dealing with problems and finding solutions. If a child can think creatively they will be able to achieve more, and have a more balanced approach to life and learning. Memorising facts is something which can be done at any time. The current education system is pushing children to remember and learn facts which can then be tested. This can cause anxiety for many children and is not the best way of learning. If children were able to learn in a more creative and inspiring way, then they will be more engaged and excited to learn. The focus on creativity and being inspired will support children to develop themselves and achieve the best results in life.
