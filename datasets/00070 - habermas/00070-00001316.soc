# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We agree that non-biodegradable plastic needs to be banned. Plastic has a lot of uses but we believe that there needs to be a push to use the alternatives such as glass, metal and paper. The main issue is that plastic is a non-renewable resource which means that once it has been made it can’t be used again. There are some plastics that can be recycled but the amount of energy required to recycle plastics is too high to be economically viable and that is why we feel that plastic should be banned. It is also worth noting that a lot of plastic ends up in landfill which is causing significant harm to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of a ban on non-biodegradable plastics.  However, it was recognised that this would be difficult to implement and that it would be difficult to find alternatives.  It was agreed that more research should be done into biodegradable plastics and that the government should be lobbied to provide more funding for this research.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should be looking into the use of non-biodegradable plastic.  We need to find a substitute for it so that we are able to eliminate the waste of non-biodegradable plastic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “In my opinion, the use of non-biodegradable plastics should be banned, or at least highly regulated.  There are so many alternatives that can be used, such as glass and metal, which are infinitely recyclable and will not cause any problems in landfill sites.  The only issue I can see with this is the cost implications, as it is often cheaper to use plastic.  This being said, I think that if we can find a way to recycle the plastics that are already in circulation, this would be a great start.  We should also look into the use of biodegradable plastics, as these can be disposed of in landfill sites and will break down.
