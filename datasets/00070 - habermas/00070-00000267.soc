# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, because laws have been in development for centuries, building off experiences from history. Starting over again will cause a lot of confusion especially if all laws are being replaced. If a new law system were to be developed it should be phased in over time.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should not get rid of all laws and start from scratch.  We need a well-functioning legal system that provides guidance for the conduct of people and organizations, and protection of their rights and interests.  The legal system we have today is a culmination of centuries of developing law and order and has been established to make the best of what has been learned in history.  It is unlikely that any new legal system that may be developed would be better than the one we have today.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that we should not get rid of all laws and start from scratch. This is because most of our laws are developed through experience and it will take a long time to develop a new system. We need laws to protect citizens and ensure that people are held accountable for their actions. There is no point in getting rid of everything that is in place now.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, laws that are in place have been in place for centuries and have been developed in such a way to allow our country to prosper and allow its people to live peacefully.
