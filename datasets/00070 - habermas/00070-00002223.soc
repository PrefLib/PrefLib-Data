# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is unacceptable for UK citizens to consume meat if they do not know whether the animals from which it came had a good quality of life. The group stated that they believe that, in order to live in a just society, citizens of the UK should be able to access information about the conditions in which the animals from which they are consuming meat were raised. This is necessary in order to ensure that animals are treated humanely, which should be a right of all animals. The group also mentioned that the government should enforce standards for animal treatment in the meat industry and that the standards should be easily accessed by citizens.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of people only eating meat from animals that had a good quality of life. However, we recognised that this would be difficult to implement, as it would be very difficult to determine what a good quality of life is for an animal, and also that this would be very expensive, and therefore would only be available to those with a higher income. We also recognised that it would be unfair to those with a lower income if they were unable to buy meat, and so we believe that it should be a personal choice for people to consume meat from animals that had a good quality of life. However, we also believe that there should be a basic standard of animal welfare that should be adhered to, and that this should be regulated by the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group was in agreement that people should be given the choice as to whether they want to consume meat that was raised in conditions that allow for a good quality of life. However, as a consensus, the group felt that this is a long-term goal that is unrealistic and will not be achieved for many years to come. They also felt that in the short-term, regulation of welfare conditions should be a top priority to ensure that animals are raised in acceptable conditions. They also felt that it is important for individuals to do their own research into the quality of life that the animals had. They felt that the public should be given as much information as possible, so that they can make informed decisions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of people consuming meat if they don’t know whether it came from animals that had a good quality of life. However, the group was in favour of a basic standard of animal welfare being implemented in the UK.
