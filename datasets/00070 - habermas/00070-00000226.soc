# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although the arts have a strong presence in society, it is more of a luxury and should be funded by individuals or businesses that benefit from it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should continue to subsidise the arts as it encourages creativity, innovation and fosters well-being.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the arts are not something that should be subsidised. However, if there is an artist that has a very good art piece or performance, then it would be fine for that artist to be subsidised as they are contributing something valuable to society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Subsidising the arts is a necessity for allowing art to continue to be created, it is a highly valued part of society and something we should continue to invest in”
