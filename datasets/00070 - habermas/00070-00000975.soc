# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Electronic devices should be allowed to be used on planes. They should be used in a respectful manner, such as using headphones, and not be used to view inappropriate material. This is because they are a good way to pass the time and can be used for entertainment purposes. However, the use of electronic devices on planes should be restricted during take off and landing, as this is when they are most likely to interfere with the aircraft's operating systems. This could result in the plane crashing and the death of all crew and passengers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the use of electronic devices on planes should be permitted, as long as they do not interfere with the aircraft's operating systems. However, this is dependent on the aircraft and its systems, and some older planes may not be able to accommodate the use of electronic devices. Therefore, it is recommended that airlines clearly communicate the policy on the use of electronic devices to passengers before they board the plane.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the use of electronic devices on planes should be allowed. If there is a risk of interference with the aircraft's operating systems, then this should be explained to the passengers and they should be asked to switch off their devices during take off and landing. If there is no risk of interference, then the use of electronic devices should be allowed at all times. If a device is used in a way that is inappropriate or causes a nuisance to other passengers, then the airline should have the right to ask the passenger to stop using the device.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Electronic devices should be allowed on planes, provided that they do not interfere with the plane's operating systems. The group felt that people should be allowed to use electronic devices on planes as long as they do not affect the safety of other passengers or the aircraft itself. The group felt that it is reasonable to use electronic devices on planes, provided that they do not interfere with the plane's operating systems. The group felt that electronic devices can help pass the time and are a good way to entertain yourself during a boring journey. The group felt that provided people use headphones and view only appropriate material, they are a reasonable way to pass the time. The group felt that the only time you are not able to fully use electronic equipment on a plane is during take off and landing. The group felt that at all other times there is no restriction on the use of these devices and most airlines even provide a charging point and access to WiFi when in flight. The group felt that there is no mobile/data signal anyway so by putting your device on flight mode you are not being penalized - would you rather not take off and land safely than take the risk of interference with the aircraft operation (whether that is a myth or not).
