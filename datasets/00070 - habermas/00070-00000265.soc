# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we do not think the state pension age should be increased.  There is no consensus on any other statement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The state pension age should not be increased.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - State Pension Age should not be raised. The current level of the state pension age is fairly high and the expected lifespan of the population is going down. If we raise the age consistently many people won't make it to retirement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should not increase the state pension age as it would make it harder for younger people to enter the workforce. The state pension age is already high compared to other neighbouring countries. Increasing the state pension age may result in an increase in unemployment. Increasing the state pension age may keep jaded, older worker in the workforce as opposed to hungry, ambitious workers.
