# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, employers should have the right to fire employees who have been convicted of a crime, if they have good reason to do so and as long as the method and decision is both fair and legal. The exercise illustrated the issues with the Delphi Method. The participants often did not even bother looking at the comments from others (a very common problem in face-to-face discussions as well), and the participants had a very one-sided view on the topic. However, despite these issues, the method, in this case, worked well, and many other similar methods of group agreement have more severe drawbacks, where, for example, people get easily offended by negative comments (as also happens in some face-to-face discussions). In addition to some of the advantages of the method described above, there were also disadvantages encountered during this exercise. One of the major ones was the effort it took to complete the task. People did not write in a lot of detail in their comments (in the responses they sometimes simply made several sentences). If, however, they had the participant numbers of the comments, they could more easily find specific comments. Instead, the comments took a long time to sift through (they were not well organised)
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We agree that it is the employer’s responsibility to hire the right person for the job and a crime could affect that in many ways. We feel that if the person was employed before they were convicted of the crime, then it is the responsibility of the employer to re-evaluate their job position and decide whether or not they still wish to keep them in their employment. We also feel that if the person was employed before they were convicted of the crime, then it is the responsibility of the employer to re-evaluate their job position and decide whether or not they still wish to keep them in their employment.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Consensus statement from group of participants: Yes, employers should have the right to fire employees who have been convicted of a crime. We agree that it is the employer’s responsibility to hire the right person for the job and a crime could affect that in many ways. However, employers should have the right to do so, as long as they do it in a legal and fair way. After all, it is the employer’s responsibility to decide whether an employee is fit for the job, and a criminal conviction could impact that decision. We also feel that if the person was employed before they were convicted of the crime, then it is the responsibility of the employer to re-evaluate their job position and decide whether or not they still wish to keep them in their employment.
