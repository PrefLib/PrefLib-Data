# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Employers should be forced to provide their employees with at least one day off from work each week. This is because employees need to have time to relax and have fun and be able to do things that they enjoy doing. This will help them to be more productive at work and make them feel happier.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Employers should be forced to provide their employees with at least one day off from work each week. Although it is important to maintain a steady economy and productivity at work, there are a growing number of studies that indicate employees are under increasing levels of stress and mental illness. Providing at least one day off a week allows for individuals to complete their errands, spend time with their families, have a day to themselves, and complete their chores, which will prevent further burnout and mental illness. This will also allow for employees to recharge their batteries, and allow them to return to work in a better state of mind.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Employers should be forced to provide their employees with at least one day off from work each week. This is because employees need to have time to spend with their families, to relax, and to complete chores. If employees are not given a day off from work each week, they will become burnt out, stressed and unproductive. This will lead to an increase in employee turnover, which is expensive for the employer. It is also important to note that employee safety and well-being is paramount to a successful economy. Not providing employees with at least one day off from work each week will result in an increase in employee burnout, reducing productivity and harming both physical and mental health of employees. This has further negative effects on the economy, such as the healthcare bill increasing and employees not spending time outside work contributing to day-off economic activity (e.g. visiting pubs, restaurants, holidays, etc).
