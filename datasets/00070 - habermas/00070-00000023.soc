# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, we need to increase the number of teachers in the education system because we are failing our children at the moment. This however doesn't just mean fill the classroom with teachers, they need to be skilled and paid the right salary especially with the cost of living crisis. We also need to ensure that schools have enough equipment and are able to provide effective teaching.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that there needs to be an increase in the number of teachers in the education system. We believe that the more teachers in the system the more attention each student will receive and the better the education will be. The debate on whether to increase the number of teachers in the education system is one that has long been argued in many countries around the world. This statement shows how groups can work together to come up with a consensual opinion even when the initial opinions of the participants differ widely.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, yes we need to increase the number of teachers in the education system because if you are a teacher and you are teaching in a class of 25 students with 5 students that need attention to their learning disability, how are you going to teach the 20 other students? Also, if you are trying to teach in a class of 25 students and there are 5 students that are very smart and want to learn more, how are you going to teach them? Therefore, we need more teachers in the education system because students are different and some students need more attention and teachers need to be able to have a good student to teacher ratio so that they can spend the right amount of time with each student, so that each student has the best learning experience possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should increase the number of teachers in the education system as this would lead to smaller class sizes which will help to increase the attention given to each child. In order to attract teachers to the role, the government should increase their salary and provide the schools with more equipment and resources.
