# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of raising the minimum age of purchase to 21. This is because people under the age of 21 are still in the process of developing and are more impressionable. This means that they are more likely to start smoking and become addicted to tobacco. However, the group did not think that the minimum age should be raised to 21, but rather to 18. This is because 18 year olds are still in the process of developing, but are also old enough to make their own decisions. The group also thought that this was a more realistic option, as it would be less likely to be passed by parliament.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the conclusion that the minimum age to purchase tobacco should be raised to 21. The health benefits of this outweigh the negatives. The age of 18 is still quite young and impressionable, and people can still be influenced by peers to take up the habit. By raising the age to 21, it is hoped that this will reduce the number of young people who take up the habit, and also the number of people who continue the habit into adulthood. The minimum age of alcohol is 18, and this is a substance that is arguably more dangerous than tobacco, so this is a good comparison. The health benefits of this outweigh the negatives, and it is hoped that this will reduce the number of young people who take up the habit, and also the number of people who continue the habit into adulthood.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “I believe that the minimum age to purchase tobacco should be raised to 21 because smoking has a huge negative impact on health. It will be harder for young people to get hold of cigarettes, which will mean they are less likely to take up the habit. I feel that young people are at a very impressionable age and are easily influenced by their peers. I believe the health benefits of smoking outweigh the financial losses to the government of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco to 21. I also think that the minimum age to purchase tobacco should be raised to 21 because at this age people have a greater sense of maturity and will be able to understand the implications of smoking on their health.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The minimum age to purchase tobacco should be raised to 21 due to the negative impact on health.
