# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe cannabis law should be relaxed for personal use, as it is too harsh for the amount of harm associated with the drug. While we are skeptical about evidence that cannabis is a gateway drug, the fact that this risk exists should be acknowledged and should be taken into account in the legal framework that is created. We believe, however, that CBD should be allowed for medicinal use, and treatment for cannabis should be encouraged, and not required, to avoid criminalization. Additionally, education of students, especially young students, should be increased in order to improve decision making ability about cannabis use and avoid potential negative consequences. Exercise 2. A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft of a consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement by the participants, and the final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the law on cannabis should be relaxed. It is a complex matter and there are good reasons why the law should be relaxed. These are mainly problems with prison sentences and social injustice where a minor trespass can lead to a tratechtory of a life involving more crime. There are also medical qualities that CBD has that can help people with severe and chronic health conditions such as cancer and chronic health. It can also be argued that the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal use and as a recreational drug would produce more revenue for the government and help to compensate for the increasingly higher use of alcohol, which is currently a legal recreational drug, in society. Canada and California have recently been making changes to the law which allow greater access to cannabis for medicinal use. The benefit of being a late adopter of such legislation is the ability to gain insight from the research and actions of these states. On the other hand, however, there is evidence that cannabis consumption can become a gateway drug. We believe we should support medical use of CBD and reduce prison sentences regarding to cannabis use, but maintain some restrictions for the better of society as a whole. We should also await the results of the research from Canada and California.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We agree that there are complex forces at play in the debate about cannabis law. We believe that the law on cannabis should be relaxed and that prison sentences regarding cannabis use should be reduced, but we also maintain that some restrictions should be in place for the better of society as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is good evidence that cannabis can have a positive impact on health and well-being. However, there are potential harms. In general, the law on cannabis should be relaxed. It is a complex matter and there are good reasons why the law should be relaxed. These are mainly problems with prison sentences and social injustice where a minor trespass can lead to a tratechtory of a life involving more crime. There are also medical qualities that CBD has that can help people with severe and chronic health conditions such as cancer and chronic health. On the other hand, however, there is evidence that cannabis consumption can become a gateway drug. In the future we should support medical use of CBD and reduce prison sentences regarding to cannabis use, but maintain some restrictions for the better of society as a whole.
