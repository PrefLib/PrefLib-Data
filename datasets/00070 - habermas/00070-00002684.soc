# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In principle, the group was in favour of free childcare.  However, the group was not convinced that this should be universal.  Rather, the group felt that free childcare should be provided to those on lower incomes, with the threshold being set at £30,000 per annum.  The group felt that this would allow parents to work and contribute to society, whilst also ensuring that all children get a better start in life by exposure to positive environments, irrespective of their background and homelife.  The group felt that this would be a more equitable solution than providing universal free childcare, as it would not require those who do not have children to pay into a system that they will not benefit from.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The government should provide free childcare for families with incomes of less than £100,000.00 per year. This will ensure that families who are struggling to pay for childcare will be able to access this service, allowing parents to work and contribute to society, whilst ensuring that all children get a better start in life by exposure to positive environments, irrespective of their background and homelife. The cost of childcare in the UK is at an unacceptable level however if the government provided universal free childcare,   there is a concern that people who do not have children would ultimately be paying into a system they will not benefit from which is not equitable. Individuals who choose to have children must take a level of responsibility to fund those children. Given the needs of society currently I would rather a system that allows for free care of the elderly than that of universal free childcare.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of free childcare but with some caveats. The consensus view was that free childcare should be available to those on low incomes and to single parents. There was a concern that free childcare for all would be an unfair burden on the tax payer and that people who do not have children would ultimately be paying into a system they will not benefit from which is not equitable. The group felt that individuals who choose to have children must take a level of responsibility to fund those children. However, the group felt that the cost of childcare in the UK is at an unacceptable level and that if the government provided free childcare, it should be linked to parents being able to work or to undertake training.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of providing universal free childcare, but with some caveats.  It was felt that it was important to ensure that this was not a free-for-all and that some form of eligibility criteria should be in place.  This would ensure that the scheme was targeted at those who really needed it and that it did not become a free service for all.  It was also felt that the scheme should be means tested and that there should be some form of 'skin in the game' for parents.  This would ensure that parents still had some level of responsibility for their children and would also encourage them to use the service in a responsible manner.  It was also felt that the scheme should be flexible and allow parents to choose the level of childcare they required.  This would allow parents to work part-time if they wished to and would also allow parents to choose to work less hours and spend more time with their children.  This would also allow parents to work more hours and earn more money if they wished to.  It was also felt that the scheme should be flexible enough to allow parents to use the service for a variety of purposes.  For example, if a parent was ill and
