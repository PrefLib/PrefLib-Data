# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we don't think air fare tax should be increased. We think the money should be spent on researching more sustainable methods of travel and helping the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No. We should be encouraging travel and we should not be discouraging the public from using planes, after all, they are the only option for travel to certain locations and we should not tax on the basis of luxury.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While the environment is suffering and air fares are too expensive, we believe that increasing the tax on air fares in the UK is a bad idea. It's not the people's fault that they need to fly to get to their destination, it's the governments fault for not having a good transport system. They should be investing in a better transport system for everyone, so people don't have to travel on planes. The government also needs to be investing in sustainable methods and using the extra tax to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of increasing the tax on air fares. Most people in the group felt that the tax on air fares was already too high. However, it was agreed that there should be some form of tax on air fares, but that it should be applied in a more targeted way. It was suggested that the tax should only be applied to flights that are considered to be a luxury, such as private jets. The group also agreed that the tax should be used to fund research into more sustainable methods of transport.
