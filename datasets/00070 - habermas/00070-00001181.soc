# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group came to the consensus view that the government should provide universal free childcare from birth. They also stated that by providing free childcare, the government will be helping children, parents and the economy. Children will benefit from early learning, parents will benefit from the additional income and the economy will benefit from the additional taxes paid by parents in employment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the decision that the government should provide free childcare from birth. We believe that it is important for the government to support families in their early years, to ensure that they are not disadvantaged due to the costs of childcare. We believe that this would also support the economy, as more people would be able to enter the workforce, and also support children in their early years.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should provide free childcare from birth. It would mean that everyone has the option to work if they wish to. It would also allow parents to take part in training and education, so they can improve their prospects for the future. This would also benefit the children as they would get the opportunity to interact with other children, and learn new skills. It would also mean that families would not struggle as much with financial worries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group of participants believe that free childcare from birth should be made available to all children as it will be better for both the parents and the children. Childcare costs are very high, and many people cannot afford them. If they were free, many parents could take up employment, allowing them to provide for their families. This would also mean that the government would be receiving more money from taxes, which would help fund the country. The children will also benefit from free childcare as they will get to interact with other children and learn from them. They will be in a safer environment, being looked after by qualified professionals. The government should ensure that all children are looked after to a high standard.
