# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that the UK government should make it mandatory for all food companies to display the sugar content of their food. This is because the health of the population is deteriorating. Diabetes is becoming more common and the prevalence of obesity is at an all time high. We believe that making it mandatory to display sugar content will allow consumers to make more informed choices when purchasing food. Many foods which are labelled as healthy have a shocking amount of sugar. The food industry is very powerful and it is hard to imagine that the government will implement this policy change, but in light of the power of the food industry, it is more important than ever that consumers themselves get savvy about what they put in their mouths, and refuse to put into their bodies, those processed food-like products that so many companies are trying to sell.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that the UK government should make it mandatory for all food companies to display the sugar content of their food. In the UK, the health of the population is deteriorating and the government should take action. Diabetes is becoming more common and the prevalence of obesity is at an all time high. We believe that making it mandatory to display sugar content will allow consumers to make more informed choices when purchasing food. Many foods which are labelled as healthy have a shocking amount of sugar. A regular can of coke for example has 12 teaspoons of sugar. We believe that displaying the sugar content of food will allow consumers to see how unhealthy unhealthy food is. We also believe that this will make the food industry reformulate their products to have less sugar in them. This would help the UK population to live healthier lives.

Diabetes is becoming more common and the prevalence of obesity is at an all time high. Displaying the sugar content of food will allow consumers to see how unhealthy unhealthy food is. We believe that this is very important as many people are unaware of the amount of sugar in the food they eat. A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft of a consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement by the participants, and the final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
