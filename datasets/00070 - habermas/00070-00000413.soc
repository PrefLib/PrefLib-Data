# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a maximum wage in the UK. The current level of income inequality in the UK is unsustainable and a maximum wage would help reduce the widening gap between the rich and the poor. By capping the amount of money that individuals can earn, we can ensure that resources are distributed fairer and that the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Income inequality in the UK is increasing to an extent which is unsustainable. We therefore believe that there should be a maximum wage in the UK. This maximum wage would be set at £100,000 for individuals and £150,000 for couples. This would apply to everyone, regardless of age, occupation or nationality. The government would have the power to reduce this maximum wage, if economic circumstances required this to be done, but it could not be raised by anyone except Parliament. If it were necessary to raise the maximum wage, this would be done by an Act of Parliament. There should be a transitional period of at least two years before the maximum wage comes into effect. This would allow people to adjust their lifestyle and financial situation to the new circumstances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, there should not be a maximum wage in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a maximum wage in the UK. However it is hard to get agreement on the issue of where it should be set.
