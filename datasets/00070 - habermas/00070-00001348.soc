# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: There is broad agreement in the group that smoking is a risky activity and should be discouraged. However, the group has had to balance the wish to reduce the risk of smoking with concern about a possible increase in black market tobacco sales to youngsters (which could cause other health problems). The group came to the view that a full ban on smoking is unlikely to work, and may lead to an increase in the risk of smoking. Therefore, the group feels that measures such as an increase in the smoking age to 21, education about the risks of smoking, providing good advertising of other alternatives to smoking and a more active role by the police in preventing the sale of tobacco products to under-age individuals will be the best way forward.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of raising the smoking age to 21. Although it was recognised that there may be some risk of increase in black market sales of tobacco products to younger people, this would be outweighed by the benefits of reducing the uptake of smoking by young people and reducing the exposure of non-smokers to tobacco smoke.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general the group was in favour of raising the smoking age to 21. Although it was recognised that there may be some risk of increase in black market sales of tobacco products to younger people, there would also be benefits of reducing the exposure of non-smokers to tobacco smoke, and the risk of health harm due to uptake of smoking by young people. It was felt that a full ban on smoking would be unworkable, but that other measures such as teaching about the risks of smoking and providing good advertising of other alternatives to smoking would also be useful.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There was a strong consensus view that raising the smoking age to 21 would be helpful in reducing the uptake of smoking by young people and reducing the exposure of non-smokers to tobacco smoke. The group felt that a full ban on smoking would be unworkable, but that other measures such as teaching about the risks of smoking and providing good advertising of other alternatives to smoking would also be useful. The group acknowledged that there may be some risk of increase in black market sales of tobacco products to younger people, but felt that this would be outweighed by the benefits of reducing the uptake of smoking by young people and reducing the exposure of non-smokers to tobacco smoke.
