# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “The participants agree that more houses should be built in the UK, however we also think that the government needs to focus on preventing homelessness and house hoarding. More houses are required to increase stock, but also to keep prices low and reduce competition for the existing houses. We are also against the government’s planned house building targets because these are unrealistic and the private sector will never reach them without financial incentives.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should build more houses in the UK to help solve the housing crisis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - More houses should be built in the UK to prevent the current housing crisis and the government should create more initiatives to support people into their own homes
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be more houses built in the UK. However, this should be carefully controlled so that the increased availability of housing does not affect the value of existing homes. Also, it is important that more housing is built in areas that are close to schools, hospitals and shopping centres.
