# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of universal basic income. The group felt that everyone in society should have a basic income to be able to live comfortably. In order to determine the basic income, the group felt that the government should ask the public what they think a basic income should be. The group also felt that the government should ask how much income is needed to be able to live comfortably. In addition, the group believed that the basic income should be flexible. For example, it should be adjusted based on the cost of living. This would mean that it is in line with inflation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A universal basic income is needed to lift people out of poverty.  It would also encourage people who want to learn and get better jobs.  It would also be a good incentive for people to try and better themselves.   A lot of people have been unemployed for a long time and it would be a good incentive for them to try and get a job.  However, it is important to understand that having a universal basic income is not going to be the magic answer to all problems and it is going to need to be worked on over time to ensure that it is giving people a quality of life and not just being able to pay the rent.  I would be concerned that the government could take the easy option and put the basic income too low but with the right political party, a basic income should be achievable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should have a Universal Basic Income. It should not be means tested. This will reduce poverty, and help alleviate the effects of inequality and rising costs of living. The basic income will also allow people to change jobs without being financially penalised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a universal basic income in the UK.  This would be beneficial for everyone.  The people who are the poorest and most in need would find it easier to cope financially and more people would be able to afford to go to university, to have their own homes, to afford food and to be able to make ends meet.  This would be a great help to our society and the people within it.
