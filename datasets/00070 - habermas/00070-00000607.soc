# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the current system is fair but it is not perfect. It is a bit outdated and it needs to be modernised. It is a good idea to introduce ID cards to make sure that people are voting legally.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the current system of elections in the United Kingdom is fair. However, it could be improved by allowing voters to split their votes. This would help avoid the issue of tactical voting and allow voters to vote for the party they truly want to vote for. It would also make the voting system more representative of the population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the current system is fair. However, it is clear that there are a number of areas where it can be improved. Firstly, the introduction of the requirement for photographic ID to vote is a step in the right direction and will help to prevent fraud. However, it is important that the government does not leave it until the last minute to announce the introduction of this requirement, as this will cause unnecessary panic. Secondly, there are areas where the current system could be improved. For example, there is a clear disproportionality in the way votes can be reflected in parliamentary seats. There are also issues with the way in which the system is archaic and not reflective of the modern political era. It is important that the government is made aware of these issues and that steps are taken to address them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the current system is fair. However, the group of participants felt that the system is outdated and in need of a revamp. The first past the post system is archaic and not reflective of the number of political parties and people may wish to split their votes. The new system should be more democratic and include more transparency and openness.
