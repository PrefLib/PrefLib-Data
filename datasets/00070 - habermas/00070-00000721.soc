# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There was a strong consensus that solar panels should be installed on all houses in the UK. It was agreed that solar panels are a great way of reducing our energy costs and they are a great way to help the environment. However, it was also agreed that there are some problems with this idea. It was agreed that it is very expensive to install solar panels on houses and it is not viable for many people to afford to do so. The group thought that the government should help with the cost of installing solar panels but it should not be forced upon people. It was agreed that this is a great idea and it would be a very good thing for the environment but the cost is a big issue and it should be addressed.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group in general thought that solar panels are a good idea to be installed on all houses, however this is easier said than done. It may be unaffordable to the poor and some houses roofs may not be suitable for the panels. We also thought that all new builds should be required to have solar panels installed on their roofs as standard.
