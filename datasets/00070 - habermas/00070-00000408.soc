# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, it should never be made illegal for a person to leave their partner or spouse. The most important aspect of relationships in this day and age is that they are mutually beneficial and voluntary. A person should never be forced to stay in a relationship. Forcing people to stay in a relationship would be like forcing them to be in a contract with someone they don't want to be in a contract with. It is no different from forcing people to work in a job that they don't want to work in. No one should be forced to be in a relationship with someone else, as this would go against basic human rights.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, it should never be made illegal for a person to leave their partner or spouse.  The best way to ensure that people have the right to stay in relationships is to make it impossible to force people to stay in relationships. In particular, in relationships where one partner is abusive, it is vital to allow the other partner to leave. Additionally, relationships can and should be about love and compromise, but should not be made to suit convenience.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, it should never be made illegal for a person to leave their partner or spouse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, it should never be made illegal for a person to leave their partner or spouse. A relationship is a voluntary agreement between two parties. No one should be forced to stay in a relationship that they are no longer a part of, that is no longer mutually beneficial, or that is abusive in any way. We should protect people by making it impossible for them to be forced to stay in a relationship that they no longer want to be a part of.
