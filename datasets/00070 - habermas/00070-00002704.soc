# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People should not be forced to work until they are 68.  However, it is recognised that people are living longer and this has an impact on the cost of pensions.  It is important that people are encouraged to save for their retirement and that the state pension is not their only source of income.  It is also important that people have the opportunity to work for as long as they want to and that they are not forced to retire at a certain age.  People should be encouraged to work for as long as they are able to and to have a flexible retirement that allows them to reduce their hours and responsibilities as they get older.  This would allow people to contribute to the economy for as long as they are able to and to enjoy their retirement when they are no longer able to work.  It is important that the government makes people aware of any changes to retirement age well in advance so that people can plan accordingly.  This would reduce the impact of any such changes.
