# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the consensus view that it is ok for sports athletes to be paid money to promote products they do not use, but it is important to remember that they should not be promoting any illegal or harmful products.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of sports athletes being paid money to promote products they do not use. It was felt that this was not fair on the consumers of these products and that it was not in the best interests of the athletes to endorse products they do not use. However, it was recognised that the athletes need funding and this may be the only way they can get it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is not okay for sports athletes to be paid money to promote products they do not use. However, if they are willing to promote the product and be associated with it, then it is not unethical for them to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, it is not ok for sports athletes to be paid money to promote products they do not use. This is because people look up to them as role models and they have a duty to make sure any products they endorse are of a suitable quality. In particular they should have agents/teams who can vet these products to make sure the company is legitimate and the product is not illegal or harmful.
