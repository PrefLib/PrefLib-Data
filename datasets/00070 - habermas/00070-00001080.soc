# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the use of DNA evidence to identify a person as a criminal is acceptable. DNA evidence can be used to identify a person as a criminal in a wide variety of cases. DNA evidence is often used to solve crimes that would have otherwise gone unsolved. The use of DNA evidence has helped to convict the guilty and exonerate the innocent. It is therefore an essential tool in the criminal justice system. It is important to ensure that the collection and analysis of DNA evidence is done in a way that is rigorous, fair and incorruptible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the use of DNA to identify criminals is acceptable. It is a very useful tool for law enforcement and can be used to identify criminals with a high degree of certainty. DNA evidence is often the only way to prove guilt or innocence in a court of law, and can be used to exonerate the innocent as well as convict the guilty. However, it is important that the collection and analysis of DNA evidence is done in a way that is fair and just, and that the results are interpreted in a way that is not biased. It is also important to remember that DNA evidence is not infallible, and that there are some circumstances where DNA evidence can be misinterpreted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While using a persons DNA to identify them as a criminal is a controversial topic, it should be used to increase the likelihood of solving crimes. DNA evidence is extremely difficult to fake and is therefore an effective way of identifying a criminal. However, it is important that this method is used with the upmost integrity and that if evidence is mishandled, the investigation must be halted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is acceptable to use a person’s DNA to identify them as a criminal, because DNA provides irrefutable evidence which has drastically increased the likelihood of crime being solved and punished.
