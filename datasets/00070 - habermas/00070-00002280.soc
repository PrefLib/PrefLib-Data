# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, it should not be a crime to fail to vote in a general election. We live in a democracy and part of that dictates that we all as citizens have the freedom of choice, both of our right to vote and for whom but also to opt out if that is what aligns with our views or expression of wish. Criminalising a lack of vote is a direct contravention of this and a disturbing backwards concept when it comes to freedom of speech and democracy in our country. Forcing citizens to vote will lead to votes that are disengenuous in nature and corrupt the meaning of the results in respect of those who voted who wanted to, for specific reasons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, it should not be a crime to fail to vote in a general election. The freedom to choose whether to vote or not is a key part of democracy. Forcing people to vote is not only an infringement of their freedom of choice, but also risks people voting for a candidate they do not support in order to avoid a fine. This would result in a vote that is not genuine and could be seen as corrupting the democratic process.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, we don't think it should be a crime to fail to vote in a general election. We feel that everyone has the right to vote or not to vote. It would be very difficult to enforce it as a criminal offence and would need significant investment as a viable policy, money which would be better spent elsewhere. We also think that making it mandatory would affect certain demographics such as those who are physically unable to vote leading to further inequality. In the end it should be up to the individual freedom of choice to  make that decision as it forces people to participate in a process they may not believe in.
