# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we should not build more nuclear power stations. It is very dangerous and poses too much of a risk to our environment and to our health. We should be looking into more renewable energy options.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should continue using nuclear power plants, as it is a source of reliable and safe energy. However, we must ensure the highest level of safety for the staff of nuclear power plants and ensure that safety is a high priority when constructing and maintaining the nuclear power plants. We also must be prepared to deal with any accidents which may occur, as these are rare and will not happen frequently.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of building more nuclear power stations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that we should build more nuclear power stations to meet our energy needs. This is because nuclear power is the cleanest and greenest energy source that we have. The risk of radiation leaks and accidents are quite small, and they don't pose a major threat to the environment. We are against the idea of building more coal plants as they are dirty and bad for the environment. We are also against the idea of using biofuels, because it means that agricultural land will be taken away from farmers, causing them to lose money. In order to make the build process as quick and easy as possible, we should try to find places that are as close to nuclear power plants as possible. This means that we won't have to worry about extending roads and transportation networks. We should also try to avoid national parks and other places that may be affected by nuclear waste. We believe that we should build more nuclear power plants, as we are currently running out of energy sources, and we need to make sure that we have a continuous supply of energy to meet our energy needs.
