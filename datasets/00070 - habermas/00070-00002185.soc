# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Consensus View: In the opinion of the group, Austerity is not always the best policy to take during a recession. Austerity, which is reducing government spending during a recession, can have both positive and negative impacts. In a recession, the economy is weak, so cutting government spending can have a negative effect, leading to further job losses and a deeper recession. This can have a major impact on the vulnerable in society and the government should be mindful of this. At the same time, being too generous during a recession can lead to an unsustainable budget deficit which can also be detrimental to the economy in the long run. Therefore, a balance needs to be reached. If a country is in a weak position during a recession, there needs to be enough austerity so that the budget deficit can be reduced, but not so much that the recession becomes much worse. If the budget deficit is already high before the recession, austerity may be needed. Also, if austerity is needed during a recession, the impact on the vulnerable in society needs to be minimised as much as possible.
