# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, people should be free to buy what they want. Banning unhealthy foods would infringe on human rights. The government should only provide information to help people make good choices.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People have the right to buy what they want, but education from the government is needed to encourage healthier food purchases. The health consequences of food purchases should be left up to the consumer, and not be dictated by the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be no ban on unhealthy foods, but there should be a very heavy tax on those products to make them less desirable. Also, health warnings should be placed on the packaging to ensure that consumers are aware of the potential health consequences of the products they are buying.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should have the freedom to buy what they want. The health consequences of food purchases should be left up to the consumer, and not be dictated by the government.
