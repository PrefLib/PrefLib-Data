# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should require all citizens to vote in elections. However, this should be paired with mandatory education sessions to ensure that all voters understand the voting process and the important of voting.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, we do not think that it is necessary to require all citizens to vote in elections. We think that this is because not everyone will have a full understanding of the issues at hand and therefore will not be making an informed decision. In a democracy, we believe that every vote must be an informed vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, we do not think it is necessary to require all citizens to vote in elections. In many cases, there are going to be people who have strong opinions and don't want to vote for a certain party and vice versa. We believe it is essential that all citizens have the right to choose not to vote. It could lead to dangerous situations if a group of people were forced to vote for something they did not agree with. However, there is an argument that it could lead to a more democratic society if everyone was required to vote. This is because every single citizen in the country would have a say on the outcome. We are undecided as a group as to which opinion is correct, but overall we think it is acceptable for some people to choose not to vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the consensus view that we should not require all citizens to vote in elections. This is because it could lead to lots of people just voting because they have to without having any knowledge or strong opinions on who or what they are voting for. It is important that every voter knows what they are voting for and not everyone will understand this. It could lead to people inadvertently voting for something they didn't mean to. We also think that it is dangerous and irresponsible to make people vote if they have no knowledge of what they are voting for. This could lead to bad decisions.
