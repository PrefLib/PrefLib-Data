# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children under 12 should not be allowed to vote as they are not mature enough to hold informed opinions on many of the complex issues surrounding politics and the future of the country. Furthermore, children at those ages are more susceptible to peer pressure from both adults and peers which could further damage an already problematic system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children under 12 should not be allowed to vote as they are not mature enough to hold informed opinions on many of the complex issues surrounding politics and the future of the country. Furthermore, children at those ages are more susceptible to peer pressure from both adults and peers which could further damage an already problematic system. This is not only due to children being easily influenced but also because children are at a stage of life where they are exploring and learning. The consensus opinion also believes that it would be difficult to get an accurate representation of the population as children are easily influenced and could be coerced into voting for a certain party. It is also important to consider that children are at an age where their opinions may not be their own and could be heavily influenced by others who may have ulterior motives. The consensus opinion also believes that a child under 12 may not have a full understanding of the issues at hand, and therefore may not be able to make an informed decision when voting.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children under 12 should not be allowed to vote as they are not mature enough to hold informed opinions on many of the complex issues surrounding politics and the future of the country. Furthermore, children at those ages are more susceptible to peer pressure from both adults and peers which could further damage an already problematic system. Also, due to immaturity, there would be a greater rate of spoiled ballots thus skewing election results. This would detract from the legitimacy of voting as a whole. After you've read through this, feel free to jot down in the comments the word you think best describes this process.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Final consensus statement: Children under 12 should not be allowed to vote as they are not mature enough to hold informed opinions on many of the complex issues surrounding politics and the future of the country. Furthermore, children at those ages are more susceptible to peer pressure from both adults and peers which could further damage an already problematic system. This is particularly important because the younger age-groups are more easily influenced than the older ones. It would also be difficult to ensure that children under 12 represent the views of a wider age group in an unbiased way.
