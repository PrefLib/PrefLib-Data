# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should be providing more subsidised childcare, as many families in our country are struggling financially, especially families with younger children. This means that often, only one parent is able to work, to try and bring in the money needed to survive, and often the wages that one parent is bringing in are barely enough to cover their expenses. This would then mean that the family is less likely to be able to afford to pay for the other parent to work, and the children in the family are then less likely to have access to after-school clubs, or have access to anything extra-curricular.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, yes we should be providing more subsidised childcare, because we have so many parents who are struggling to get by in our country. This means that in a lot of families, only one parent can work as they cannot afford childcare for the other parent to work, and the wages are only just enough for the one parent. So if we were to provide more subsidised childcare, we would be helping the country and the families of the country as we would have more parents working and therefore providing more money for the country, which would then hopefully come back to us as the working people. And also, if we do not provide more subsidised childcare, there is a higher chance of parents leaving their children unattended for longer than they should be. This is a crime and should not be happening in our country, as it can cause many issues in the child's future life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, yes we should be providing more subsidised childcare. The current crisis and the raising cost of living means that many families are struggling to make ends meet. In a lot of families, only one parent can work as they cannot afford childcare for the other parent to work, and the wages are only just enough for the one parent. The stress of this current situation causes many families to fall apart. So if we were to provide more subsidised childcare, we would be helping the country and the families of the country as we would have more parents working and therefore providing more money for the country, which would then hopefully come back to us as the working people. It would also help children under 3 not to be left alone at home unattended, as they should be with someone who can look after them, and they should not be treated as a burden. Studies show that the first years of childhood are crucial to their future development and most of them are not getting all the support they need at home. It would also provide more time for the parent at home to look for a job, so they can also help to provide for their family and their child, which would be beneficial for the child, the parent and the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be more subsidised childcare as it can help families and children. If a family is struggling to provide for a child, the government needs to be there to help. The government should also subsidise childcare for families who are not struggling, because even for those who are well off, the cost of childcare is rising and therefore it can also be helpful to subsidise childcare for them as well. If we subsidise childcare for families who are struggling to provide for their children and for families who are not struggling, we are helping the economy because more people are working and therefore the economy is rising. We are also helping the children and the families, because the families are not stressed with the childcare cost, they can focus more on looking after their children. If we subsidise childcare, we are helping to prevent children from being left unattended, which is a crime and can cause issues in the child's future life.
