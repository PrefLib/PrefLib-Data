# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group of participants were broadly in agreement that the UK was too strict when it came to gun ownership, and the group felt this was one of the main reasons the USA was so much more prone to mass shootings. The group were of the opinion that gun ownership was less dangerous than the law makes it out to be, and that there should be more restrictions on other things which cause more deaths, such as knives and drugs. I asked the participants what they felt about the issue of whether or not the government should enforce its will on the people, and this is what they had to say:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK is not too permissive when it comes to regulating gun ownership. I think the UK has a very good system in place when it comes to guns and ownership. The UK is strict in terms of what people can and cannot buy. In terms of knife crime, I think this is more of an issue than gun crime, and it is essential to tackle knife crime first. I think it is important to ensure that people are aware of what is legal and illegal when it comes to guns. If we educate people about the law in regards to guns, then I think we can prevent crime and ensure that people abide by the law and use guns responsibly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the UK is strict enough when it comes to gun ownership. This is because there are various laws and regulations in place to ensure that only the right people are able to buy and use guns. This means that the general public are unable to access guns, which is a good thing as it means that the number of gun related crimes is kept to a minimum.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the UK is not too permissive when it comes to regulating gun ownership. However, the UK could be more strict in terms of what guns people can buy and what permission people need to buy/use guns. The UK should regularly look at its laws to make sure they still work and adjust if needed. The UK should be strict about who can get hold of guns like automatic guns etc. There should be checks on people and guns only needed for farming ie shooting hares and birds. The UK is strict not permissive when it comes to gun ownership.
