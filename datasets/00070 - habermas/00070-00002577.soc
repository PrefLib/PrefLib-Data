# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I believe that the voting age should be reduced to 16 years old. Once a person reaches the age of 16, they are able to acquire part-time jobs, paying into the economy by generating revenue through the work that they do and by paying tax on the income they generate. The Government's job is to distribute tax income to support the inhabitants of a country, and if you as an individual have the potential to pay into the system, you should have a say, via voting rights, on how that tax money is spent and by whom.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No I don't think it should as I feel the opinion of a 16 year old would be influenced heavily by their parents and at that age it's very hard to figure out a political stance. The same reason for their opinion being easily influenced through schools and their friends. I think it's much better to keep the voting age at 18 which the individual can slowly learn about politics and create a better stance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes I think the age should be lowered to 16. In many cases 16 year olds are considered adults and have to contribute towards society so I feel their opinion is important. 16 year olds can have jobs, live away from family and have babies so their opinions on society are as important as 18 year olds. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I think at 16, I personally didn't have a full understanding of politics. If politics was taught as a compulsory subject, then I could see why this would work. The decisions made by governments will impact on young people for longer so the young should be involved in politics to shape their future. I do, however, worry that some young people would be influenced by extreme views without realising the consequences of this due to a lack of real knowledge of politics.   I think it is important to engage young people in politics and for them to have a real passion for how the world works. At the moment, I feel as though many feel disillusioned by politics and that it 'isn't for them'. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I think the voting age should be reduced to 16 for a few reasons. One is it starts to engage younger people in politics and making them realise they can help create shifts in policies, which would help improve engagement over time. It also allows people this age to vote directly on things that affect them which is only fair, like issues of education. It would also add numbers to the voting pool which is desirable for voter engagement and reflecting more accurately the wants of wider society through voting outcomes.
