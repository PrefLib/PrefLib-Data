# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Religious schools should not receive public funding. We believe that it is the responsibility of parents to pay for their children's education, and that the government should not be funding religious schools. The government has a responsibility to ensure that all children receive a good education, but this can be done through the state schools that are already in place. Religious schools can be funded by the parents of the children who attend.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No religious school should receive public funding. It would be unfair to fund some religions and not others. The public money could be better spent on improving the quality of education in state schools. It is also important that children are not separated into different schools according to their religion, and that they are able to mix with people from different backgrounds.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of public funding of religious schools. However, the group did recognise that some schools may be better suited to providing an education to students than the state, and so in these cases, public funding may be necessary to ensure that all students are receiving the best education possible. The group also felt that it was important that all students are able to mix with students of different religions and backgrounds, and so funding should only be provided to schools that are able to provide this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No religious school should receive public funding. Some schools may have extremist views and these should not be supported by public money. The funding could be a lot better used elsewhere. If the students really want to attend a religious school, they should be willing to help support it themselves. It would be far too expensive to fund all religious schools.
