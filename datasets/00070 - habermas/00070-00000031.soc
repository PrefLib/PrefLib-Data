# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There are lots of things that need to be taken into account when deciding whether using animals for scientific research is ethical. In the case of the use of animals for scientific research the possible benefits and downsides of the use of animals should be weighed. Animal experimentation should only be used when there are no alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is ethical to use animals for scientific research if it helps to improve human life and/or if the use of animals can reduce the number of human trials that are needed. It is unethical if it can be proven that the use of animals can lead to suffering and harm.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the use of animals for scientific research is considered to be unethical. However, where a human's life is at risk it is considered ethical to use animals for research.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “I believe that the use of animals in scientific research is a very complicated issue. In some cases it may be absolutely necessary and in others it is unnecessary. However, it is difficult to define when an experiment is absolutely necessary as a lot of the time the effects of a drug or chemical are unknown. Also, I think that there needs to be some sort of balance between the welfare of the animals and the research to be carried out, if an animal is going to suffer from an experiment then it is unethical. However, some experiments may not harm the animal at all, for example, a very small incision to take a blood sample. So, I believe that there needs to be a more in-depth review of the use of animals in research and the use of alternatives, such as computer models.”
