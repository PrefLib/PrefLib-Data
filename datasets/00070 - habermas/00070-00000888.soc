# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Dogs do have the right to live and they should be treated as living creatures, not human beings.  We should be treating dogs as dogs and not dressing them up in clothes and taking them with us wherever we go.  We also should not try to turn a dog into a human or treat it in the same way that we would treat a human.  Humans have higher rights in this world due to our ability to contribute to society in a greater way than dogs can.  Also, sometimes there are some circumstances where human life would be favoured over a dog's life as the human has a lot more to offer society than the dog.  Humans are more likeable by other humans which make humans more deserving to life over the dog.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Dogs should have the same right to live that a human has.  This is because a dog is a living creature and therefore should have the right to live.  However, the group also felt that there are some cases where a human life should be chosen over a dog's life.  For example, if a human and a dog were in a fire and there was only one way out, the human should be saved first.  This is because the human is able to make a greater contribution to society.  The group also felt that some people treat their dogs as if they are humans and this is not right.  For example, some people dress their dogs in clothes and take them everywhere with them.  This is not right as dogs are not humans and should not be treated as such.  However, dogs should be treated with the same kindness and compassion that humans would want to receive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The right to live is something all animals possess and in this regard, dogs should have the same right to life that a human has. The human-dog relationship goes back centuries and throughout this time humans have exercised power over dogs by controlling their breeding and domesticating them for different purposes. Recently the tide has turned and in many societies today the human is no longer considered superior and in this regard many people value dogs equally or sometimes even more than other humans. Many argue that the fact dogs cannot communicate verbally to humans in any sophisticated way that humans consider appropriate makes them inferior. In their world view dogs are seen as dumb beasts that act solely on instinct and feeling. We argue however that in fact, a dog can use body language, hand signals, the way they walk and wag their tails to create whole conversation patterns and send complex messages which human may just not fully understand, although they certainly respond. Communication is a key feature of many species including dogs and people should see them for more than just beasts of burden that can be used, discarded and re-used in a new home.  In addition, by emphasising certain breeds over others, humans are taking from their natural evolutionary cycle which selects for certain skills such as running and survival
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the statement that a dog should have the same right to live that a human has.  This is because a dog is a living creature and therefore should have the right to live.  However, the group also felt that there are some cases where a human life should be chosen over a dog's life.  For example, if a human and a dog were in a fire and there was only one way out, the human should be saved first.  This is because the human is able to make a greater contribution to society.  The group also felt that some people treat their dogs as if they are humans and this is not right.  For example, some people dress their dogs in clothes and take them everywhere with them.  This is not right as dogs are not humans and should not be treated as such.  The group would like to make it clear that although dogs are not the same as humans, they are still living creatures that have the right to live.  If a person chooses to have a dog, then they have a responsibility to make sure that their dog is looked after.
