# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that we should implement free early childhood education. We all believe that education should be accessible to all and the more knowledge and experience that children have the better the future of society will be. The initial costs may be expensive but the overall effects will benefit society in the long run. There may be the argument that the current tax system is not sufficient to support this policy, however we believe that with careful use of resources this policy can be achieved.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Early childhood education should be free for all children. Children should not be discriminated against based on their family’s financial situation. All children should be provided with the same opportunities and experiences, so that all children are given the same start in life. Free education will provide a sense of equality, a sense of pride and would be beneficial for everyone in society. It would be necessary to use public finances to support this model of education, this could be achieved through increased taxation or through the government re-directing funds from other sources, for example from those who do not have children. Those without children may feel that they are funding something that does not benefit them, however the long term benefits of free early childhood education will benefit society as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that we should implement free early childhood education. All children should have access to the same opportunities and resources to allow them to be successful in later life. In order to ensure this happens, we must use the resources we have available to us in the best possible way to support this. The initial cost may be expensive but the overall effects will benefit society in the long run. There may be the argument that the current tax system is not sufficient to support this policy, however we believe that with careful use of resources this policy can be achieved. The policy should be carefully managed so that those who don't have children do not feel penalised. Conclusion:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that we should implement free early childhood education. We all believe that education should be accessible to all and the more knowledge and experience that children have the better the future of society will be. There may be the argument that the current tax system is not sufficient to support this policy, however we believe that with careful use of resources this policy can be achieved. One argument against is that the tax system may not be sufficient to fund this policy and therefore alternative means may be required to achieve this policy.
