# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People in general do not realise the impact that they have on the environment, and some need to be made more aware of how they can be more sustainable in their lives. The government needs to force large companies and the super-rich to pay a tax to combat climate change, and it needs to reduce it's own carbon footprint.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was wary of giving the government any more power to tax individuals. Instead, they suggested that large corporations should be made to pay for the impact that they have on the climate. However, they also agreed that the government should be able to introduce laws that target specific individuals who are living lifestyles which are causing harm to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although climate change is a worrying issue, and we should all be doing our part to reduce our carbon footprints, it is not the government's responsibility to make people pay a tax to combat climate change. Individuals can decide themselves how to combat the issue, and I believe that the government has bigger things to worry about than climate change, as they do not always get it right. The only people that should pay tax to combat climate change are the large companies or super rich who travel in private jets etc.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be taxes, however they should not be 'forced'. The word 'forced' has negative connotations that do not necessarily fit with the topic. Also, the question does not specify who the tax should be aimed at. The tax should be aimed at organisations and the super rich, as they are the biggest contributors to climate change.
