# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is a high possibility that we will see another economic downturn.  This is due to the current political climate and the fact that there are many factors that contribute to economic downturn, including a lack of resources, war, trade deals and inflation, all of which are somewhat unavoidable.  Whilst it is difficult to predict what the outcome of the downturn will look like, it is certain that there will be periods of economic prosperity and hardship.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There is a high possibility that we could be put in a similar situation to the 2022-2023 crisis again. But, we should be prepared and try to prevent it. If we can reduce inflation and if wages can increase we can avoid another serious economic downturn. The economy is still recovering from the crisis, but if we can manage it correctly we can get back on track.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, we will definitely have another serious economic downturn. The current state of the global economy is volatile. It is difficult to say when this economic downturn will occur and what it will look like. The global economy is so complex and relies on a number of factors such as supply and demand, interest rates, inflation, employment, trade deals, and environmental factors. There are a number of factors that suggest that the global economy is unstable.  Inflation is currently rising in many countries. Many Governments are currently experiencing a recession, e.g. United States, Brazil, Australia, UK. Many are currently going through a recession, e.g. United States, Brazil, Australia, UK. Many are currently struggling to balance their budget, e.g. United States, UK. These factors indicate that there are likely to be some future economic hardships for people.  It is difficult to say when this downturn will occur and what it will look like. However, it is likely that Governments will be in a better position to deal with this downturn due to the lessons learnt from the last economic downturn.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, the group of participants have come to a consensus that we will have another serious economic downturn.  The opinions of the participants were very similar and there were no strong disagreements.  The participants all agreed that the world is very unstable and that prices can not continue to rise indefinitely as salaries can not keep up.  This in turn will lead to the bubbles, e.g. the housing bubble burst.  The participants all agreed that unsustainable environmental practices will play a major role e.g. not being able to produce enough food.  The participants also agreed that it is difficult to predict what the outcome of the downturn will look like, but it is certain that there will be periods of economic prosperity and hardship.
