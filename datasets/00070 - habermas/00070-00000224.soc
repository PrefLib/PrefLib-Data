# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People who can't pay their mortgage should not be repossessed immediately. The bank should allow a period of time for the individual to improve their situation. However, if there is no prospect of an improvement, then the bank should repossess the house.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a set time period, i.e. 6 months to 1 year, after which a repossession would be implemented if the homeowner has been unable to get back on a financial footing that means they can afford their repayments.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, repossession of homes should only be considered after all other avenues have been exhausted. If a person is able to prove that they will be able to get back on track in the near future, it would be wise for the mortgage company to wait before repossession.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE THEIR HOUSE REPOSSESSED FOR FAILING TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE BUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME SHOULD BE GIVEN FOR THEM TO PAY BACK THE MONEY.
