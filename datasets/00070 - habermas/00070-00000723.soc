# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the system we have in the UK, with a Prime Minister, is the most effective system for the UK.  A President would have too much power and may not be accountable enough to the people.  The Prime Minister has to work with other parties to get laws passed, and so is more accountable to the people.  A President could make decisions that are not in the best interests of the people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, it is slightly better to have a Prime Minister.  A Prime Minister is chosen by the people, and is the leader of the party with the most votes.  This means that they have the support of the people and will do what they can to keep them happy.  A President is chosen by a select group of people, and so may not have the support of the majority.  This means that they may not be able to get the laws passed that they want to, and this can lead to problems.  A Prime Minister is also in charge of the whole government, and so can make sure that all the different parts of the government work together.  This means that things can be done quickly and efficiently, whereas a President may not be able to get things done so quickly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There would be no difference between having a Prime Minister or a President. Both would be elected and both would have to listen to the people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In conclusion, the group of participants feel that it would be slightly better to have a Prime Minister as a president seems to have higher status and more power, but perhaps that is simply my perception of the status of US presidents in particular. However, this doesn't seem to be a great system in America, and I feel that despite its many flaws, the UK government under a Prime Minister, is overall an effective system. Notably, we have an excellent benefits system and child poverty has halved in the last 15 years.
