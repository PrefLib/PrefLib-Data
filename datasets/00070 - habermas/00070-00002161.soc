# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We don’t believe we should prohibit the sale of alcohol as it is more damaging to the society to do so, and there are already laws in place to stop alcohol being abused by those that are responsible for the majority of the trouble caused by it. There are already penalties for those who break the law, which is effective in stopping trouble and deterring people from acting irresponsibly. We believe it is better to educate people on the effects of alcohol and how to drink responsibly rather than prohibit it as it would cause more harm than good.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although alcohol related deaths can be directly linked to alcohol consumption, we do not feel that prohibition is the answer. Prohibition of alcohol will not stop people drinking alcohol, they will still obtain it illegally and if anything it will increase the crime rate. People should be taught to drink responsibly, as long as people do not drink to excess there should be no harm. As long as we have laws that punish irresponsible drinking then alcohol should not be prohibited.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol. The group felt that people should be allowed to make their own choices, and that the government should not interfere in peoples lives. However, the group did feel that the government should be doing more to promote responsible drinking. The group felt that the government should be doing more to educate people on the dangers of alcohol, and to promote safe drinking. The group felt that the government should be doing more to promote the safe use of alcohol, such as promoting the use of designated drivers, and the use of public transport.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was opposed to prohibiting the sale of alcohol. It was felt that this would not be practical, and would lead to an increase in the use of illegal substances, which would be more dangerous. It was felt that people should be allowed to make their own decisions about what they consume, and that the current laws are sufficient to control the negative effects of alcohol.
