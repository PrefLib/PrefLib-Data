# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, I think we shouldn't change the terminology.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of keeping the term sexual harassment. The group felt that the term sexual harassment is a more serious term and one that is widely recognised. The group felt that the term unwanted sexual attention could be used to describe a broader range of behaviours, some of which may not be as serious as others. The group felt that unwanted sexual attention could be used as an umbrella term for a range of behaviours, with sexual harassment being one of the more serious behaviours.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that changing the terminology would minimise the severity of the issue and therefore should not be changed. However, this does not mean that the term ‘sexual harassment’ cannot be redefined. The definition of sexual harassment does not cover all instances of ‘unwanted sexual attention’ and therefore we should be aware of the fact that there is a spectrum of different actions which are sexual in nature and unwanted by the recipient. The importance of the legal definition of sexual harassment should not be understated and should be considered when redefining the term.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we should not replace the term “sexual harassment” with “unwanted sexual attention”. We feel that the term “sexual harassment” is a more serious term and is therefore more likely to be taken seriously. The term “unwanted sexual attention” could be seen as a less serious term and could therefore be taken less seriously.
