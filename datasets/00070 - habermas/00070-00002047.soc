# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a growing awareness of the negative impact of humans on the environment, particularly the impact of large corporations. Consumers, however, are often blamed for the current environmental issues, and it is important to acknowledge that it is the largest corporations who are responsible for the most destruction. It is vital that the public acknowledge the importance of protecting the environment, and are willing to put in effort and money to protect it. However, the public can only vote for a government that they think will protect the environment. We need to collectively change our mindsets from profit-driven to people-driven, and only then will we see a positive change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There needs to be a greater recognition of the role that the largest corporations play in causing environmental destruction. In order to reduce environmental destruction, corporations will need to put in more effort to use sustainable practices. Governments should be working towards making the environment a priority, by putting in place higher taxes and penalties on corporations who do not comply. It will take more than just a few people making an effort to protect the environment, we need to all work together to make an effort. Education will be a big part of this, and schools should be educating children about how they can help the environment. But education alone will not be enough to solve the problem, we need to be willing to put in the effort and money to protect the environment, and only then will we see a positive change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It was agreed by the group that we as a society need to start looking at our current environmental issues not as something that can be fixed easily and quickly with education, but as something that will take time and money. Looking to the future, we will see more and more of the large corporations making an effort to be more environmentally conscious, whilst also avoiding paying large taxes and penalties imposed on corporations that cause high levels of damage to the environment. The individual participants also agreed that while the government should be enforcing environmental regulations on corporations, it is ultimately the people who will have the biggest impact by electing the government that they see as most suitable to deal with environmental issues. Conclusions Protecting the environment is a very hot topic right now, given how much damage we have already caused and how rapidly we are running out of time to make real change and ensure a sustainable future. My experience of having this group discussion taught me some valuable lessons. Firstly, it demonstrated the value of face to face discussions with other people when forming an opinion. My personal opinion before this discussion was that we are not doing enough as a society to protect the environment. Throughout the discussion I saw the other participants ideas, points and opinions, whether they agreed or disag
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Though it has become apparent that human intervention is a key cause of environmental issues, we as a society are not doing enough to protect the environment. We are too focused on blaming the actions of consumers for the current environmental issues, whilst the largest corporations are the ones to blame for their unethical, profit driven decisions. It is the responsibility of the government to regulate such companies and ensure they are held accountable for the damage they cause. Only then, will we see a positive change. As we move towards the future, more and more of these corporations will have to make the decision to be more ethical in their business practices, or they will face much higher taxes and penalties. We cannot expect companies to make this decision, without putting pressure on them first. The government plays a key role in the protection of our environment and by choosing the right government, the future of our environment can be protected. We also need to be willing to put in effort and money to protect the environment and this is something we are not willing to do as an individual. These changes are necessary as time goes on, because if we do not take them now, it will be too late. More must be done to protect the environment now, for the environment to be
