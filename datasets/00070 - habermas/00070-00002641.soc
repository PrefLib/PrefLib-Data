# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes. I don't think that the law is always the best deterrent for things like alcohol and drugs, but considering that it is at least a controlled substance, I think increasing access to alcohol to younger people is an incredibly bad idea. The amount of alcohol-related deaths in the UK is likely already very high, and drinking culture in this country won't be solved by encouraging more people to drink.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I think that reducing the drinking age to 16 would be a very bad idea and I could definitely see it leading to an increase in deaths.  The human body is mot yet fully matured at this age, both physically, mentally and emotionally and I think that alcoholic drinking could only have a negative affect.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I believe lowering the drinking age to 16 would increase alcohol-related deaths simply because I think more teens would start drinking. I also think that it being legal for a 16 year old to drink may mean they drink more and to higher intoxication levels, this could be severe for them as their body's are not fully developed and could possibly feel the damage on their bodies more, like their livers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I don't think it would. I think the issue with alcohol related deaths is more about the culture of drinking in general. It needs addressed through education in schools, universities, and into adulthood through campaigns targeted at parents especially to help them feel confident in how to deal with children in their care drinking. I think it's also an issue for healthcare to tackle. More regulations around alcohol would be good, but this specific one would have very little impact when children under 16 are drinking anyway. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I don't think it would make much of a difference as if teenagers want to get hold of alcohol they generally can anyway, I don't believe we should drop the drinking age though as I believe 18 is the right age and frankly nobody wants to put up with 16 year old children in bars and pubs.
