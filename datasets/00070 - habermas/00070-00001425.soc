# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of making divorce easier to obtain. This was mainly because marriage is not a do or die affair and as such should be tackled very fast before it gets bad. In cases where there are children involved, divorce should be made harder to obtain as this would force people to work on their marriage to help it succeed. In cases where there is domestic violence or abuse involved or harm to children identifiable by law, special arrangements should be allowed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is the opinion of the group that divorce should not be easier. Marriage is a serious commitment and not a passing fancy. There should be more counseling and mediation available to those who feel they cannot carry on with their marriage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While it is very important that marriage remains an important institution in society, the ever changing nature of society, and people's attitudes and beliefs to marriage and relationships means that the requirements for divorce must be looked at. Marriage used to be a very different institution with men holding more power over the woman, and less recognition given to the rights of women, children and the vulnerable. However, today we live in a more liberal society where many people have different opinions and attitudes. If one person is in a marriage where the other is abusive, unfaithful, does not contribute to the household or have any regard for the other partner, then it is wrong to make them stay in that marriage. While divorce should not be made easier, it should not be so hard that the only option left for people in this situation is to leave. The laws should change so that those in these situations can leave their marriages easily, without being punished financially or emotionally.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of making divorce easier to obtain in the UK. They felt that the current system was too adversarial and that the process was too long and expensive. They felt that the process of divorce should be more of a formality and that the process should be less adversarial. They felt that the process should be less regulated by courts and solicitors and that the process should be less regulated by paperwork, litigation and time. They felt that fiscal settlements should be a different matter of course. They felt that the process should be a one document application, countersigned and verified only. They felt that the process should be no fault divorces and that special arrangements should be allowed in cases of things such as abuse.
