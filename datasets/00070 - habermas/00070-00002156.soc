# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should be taught to respect and care for the elderly, however, they should not be forced to provide care to the elderly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that children should be taught to take care of the elderly, not only in their family but in the community as well.  It would teach them valuable life lessons on compassion and empathy.  It would also teach them the valuable lesson of knowing when they are needed and when they are not.  It would teach them how to be more compassionate towards those who have a lot less than they do and to take nothing for granted.  If they learned this at an early age, it would stay with them their whole lives.  When the time came for them to need help, they would remember how it felt to be cared for and they would in turn want to give that same care to someone else.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should be taught to respect and care for the elderly.  This is something that can be taught at home and in schools.  Children should be taught to treat elderly people with respect and dignity and to help them when they need help.  This is something that is already being taught in schools and we believe it should be taught at home also.  It is something that is good for children to learn and will stand to them in later life.  It is something that should be taught to all children and is not something that should be left to the discretion of the parents.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children should be taught how to care for others and treat them with respect. This is to help develop a more caring culture, which should be one of society's highest priorities. It is also important to allow the elderly to be as independent as possible.
