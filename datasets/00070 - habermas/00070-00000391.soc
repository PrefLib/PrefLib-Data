# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The minimum age for buying cigarettes should be raised from 18 to 21 to reduce the number of people smoking in society. This will also lead to less revenue generated from cigarette sales which can be used to fund public services such as the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The minimum age should be raised from 18 to 21, not because under 21s aren't adults but because the more barriers there are in the way of young people being able to get cigarettes the more likely it is that they will grow out of the habit. The negatives will come from a reduced tax revenue on cigarettes, but hopefully this will be offset by fewer people using the NHS in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the raising of the age limit from 18 to 21 will not lead to a reduction in smoking habits. Young people can be influenced by many different factors in their teenage years which can lead to them developing smoking habits. Those under the age of 18 may find ways to buy cigarettes. Raising the age will only lead to less revenue from tax on cigarette sales.  A much better way to reduce the prevalence of smoking among young people would be to educate young people on the dangers of smoking, as well as raise the price of cigarettes to make them much less affordable for young people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In principle, yes the age should be raised, however, in practice, we do not think it will have a significant impact.
