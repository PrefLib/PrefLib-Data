# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although raising airline taxes would be a good idea, it would be unfair to the consumers who have no choice but to fly to make their living. If the airline tax was raised and the money gained was used to fund environmentally friendly alternatives to flying, it could lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gases. However, the responsibility of climate change should not be placed on the shoulders of the general public when corporations are the ones who have a much greater impact on the climate and their profit-driven decisions are what is causing climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the idea of raising airline taxes to combat the damage that flying is causing to the environment seems to be a good idea, however there are many issues with it. It would be unfair to those who have no choice but to fly for their job, it would be unfair to those who cannot afford the higher prices, and it would be unfair to those who cannot afford to fly at all, but would like to. It would also be unfair to those who have to travel long distances and cannot use other forms of transport, such as trains. The taxes would also be unfair to those who are already paying a lot for their flights, such as families, who may not be able to afford to travel as often. The taxes would also not be enough to make a significant change to the damage that is being caused to the environment. It is also unfair to those who are not causing as much damage to the environment, such as the oil corporations who are producing the fuel, and the plane manufacturers who are producing the planes. In general, raising airline taxes would not be a good idea, however there should be other ways to combat the damage that is being caused by the use of airlines.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of raising airline taxes to combat climate change. This is because flying is a major contributor to climate change and it is therefore important to find ways to reduce the amount of flying that people do. However, it is also important to consider that there are many people who have no choice but to fly in order to make a living. Therefore, it is important that the extra taxes raised are used to research into more environmentally friendly ways of flying, so that those who have to fly can do so in a way that is less harmful to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Overall, we agree that the airline industry is one of the major contributors to climate change and global warming. In the context of such a complex problem, a solution must involve a balance of economic, political and ethical factors. As we see it, there are pros and cons to increasing the tax of air travel, it may be an effective solution in some circumstances, however in others it may have some undesirable consequences. Our overall consensus is that the solution to climate change cannot be found in one approach, it is a complex problem and requires complex solutions that can have both immediate and long-term benefits.
