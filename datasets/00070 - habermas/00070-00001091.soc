# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, keeping a wild animal as a pet is not a good idea. Animals should be able to live in the wild where they are meant to be. If there is no way to allow an animal to be released into the wild, and they have been bred in captivity, then they should be placed in a zoo, sanctuary or other controlled environment. If a wild animal is kept as a pet, it must be kept in a large, natural environment. It is preferable that it lives in an environment where it can live with other animals of its own kind.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is not acceptable to keep a wild animal as a pet if it has been bred in captivity, unless the animal can be returned to the wild safely. If there is any solution that can be arranged in which the animal can go back to being wild, that should be considered first. Wild animals should not be kept in captivity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Keeping wild animals as pets is a complicated issue. In an ideal world, all animals would be able to live in the wild, in their natural habitat. However, this is not always possible. There are many reasons why an animal may not be able to survive in the wild, such as a lack of survival skills, being unable to integrate into a wild animal group, or being unable to survive in the wild due to a disability. If it is not possible for an animal to be returned to the wild, it may be necessary to keep it as a pet. This should be a last resort, and the animal should be kept in the most spacious enclosure possible, to allow it to live as naturally as possible. The priority should always be to return an animal to the wild if it is at all possible to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In principle, it is not acceptable to keep a wild animal as a pet if it has been bred in captivity. This is because wild animals should be in their natural habitat, living with their own kind, and not in someone's home. In some cases, it may be necessary to keep a wild animal as a pet if it cannot be returned to the wild, but this should be a last resort.
