# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that more should be spent on mental health services as this is an area that we see in the media and in comments from friends and colleagues. We think that mental health is an area of weakness in our health service that needs further work. The deaths of people who could not get the support they needed is common and there seems to be no cure for some mental health issues. The waiting list to be referred for mental health is to long and much more support should be given to help people. The current pandemic and previous lockdowns has affected mental health for many people and they are still not getting the help needed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, yes we should spend more on mental health services. More resources would mean that mental health patients are less likely to turn to crime and could focus on other aspects of their life such as their education. With a greater level of education, they would be more likely to have higher-paid jobs in the future and contribute to the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - More should be spent on mental health services. The current pandemic and lockdowns have increased stress and anxiety for many people. This has resulted in increased levels of suicides and depression, which has had an impact on the economy and the welfare of individuals. The funding is currently too low and the help is not always available for the people who need it. The waiting lists are too long and the access to mental health services needs to be increased.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Mental health services should be prioritised, they are very underfunded and very much needed for the general public. The problem is not necessarily the health services themselves, but the fact that the government does not provide enough money to fund them. The cost of living has gone up and the cost of living pressure has been passed down to the public. Mental health has been on the rise and the government should make the health services their priority and increase the funding.
