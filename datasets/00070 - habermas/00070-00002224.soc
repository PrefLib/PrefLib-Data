# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Women in parliament would mean more representative government, so that there would be more women's voices heard and more women's needs addressed. Women's voices need to be heard in parliament to properly represent the opinions of the whole country. In the past, women have been excluded from parliament due to sexist stereotypes that women are not intelligent enough to hold such a position. Women have different views to men and have to deal with different problems. This means they will have different solutions to problems and will make better decisions. They have the ability to use empathy, compassion and an understanding of the issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the proportion of women in parliament should be representative of society as a whole. Until this is achieved, the proportion of under-represented groups should be increased so we can work towards a system of government that actually truly represents, and can advocate for, the people it is governing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Women should be represented in parliament in proportion to their representation in the population. This is necessary to ensure that women's voices are heard and that they are able to advocate for their own interests. Women are often more disadvantaged than men in society, and are less likely to have their voices heard. Women in parliament can advocate for policies that will improve women's lives and the lives of their families. Women also have a different perspective to men, and it is important that this perspective is heard and considered when decisions are being made.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should increase the proportion of women in parliament. If there are any women out there that would like to be in parliament but are currently not being given the opportunity for some reason, we should change this. Women need to have a voice and there should be the same amount as men if possible. Women are naturally more empathetic and rational with their thinking, which would make parliament run better. However, we don't think women should be in parliament just because we need a certain number of women representing the country.
