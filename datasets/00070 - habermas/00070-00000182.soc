# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I think we should start taking action to move toward banning single use plastics as much as we possible can. However if this is to push the cost of things up at a time where people are struggling to pay the bills, I think it needs to be a gradual thing in line with increases in pay etc otherwise it just won't be feasible and people won't do it.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should ban all single use plastics, as it can be avoided and done so without any real inconvenience to people. In the cases where the use of single use plastics cannot be avoided, we should introduce a tax on the purchase of single use plastics, to try and push people away from using them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, we think that single use plastics should be banned. The way we see it, as long as alternatives are available to be used in place of single use plastics, then there is no reason for them to continue to exist. However, there are some areas where single use plastics are necessary. For example, the use of single use plastics is unavoidable for certain medical uses such as surgical gloves, or bags to store medicine in for example. In these cases it is not practical to introduce alternative methods of storing these items. In addition, there are also food products where single use plastics may be necessary to maintain the quality of the food. For example, fresh meat needs to be sealed up in order to avoid cross contamination with other items and reduce the risk of spoiling. In this case, it is important that a suitable alternative is introduced as soon as possible, but until this is the case, we should allow the continued use of single use plastics for this type of product.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that most single use plastics can and should be banned. We also believe that in some cases the use of single use plastics is necessary and unavoidable, and in those cases there needs to be strict guidelines for the recycling and disposal of them.
