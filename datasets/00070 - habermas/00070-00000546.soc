# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that a third runway should be built at Heathrow Airport. This is because we believe that the potential to increase jobs in the local area will outweigh the increased pollution and congestion in the area. It would also increase the ability of airlines to come to Heathrow and so more people would be able to come to the UK which is also an economic benefit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should not build a third runway at Heathrow Airport as this would be against all current efforts to reduce air pollution and the carbon footprint of air travel. Whilst building another runway may encourage more business and more airlines to come to Heathrow, this is not a good reason to go against the climate change policies that are currently in place. We should be looking at other options to combat climate change rather than building a third runway and contributing to climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of a third runway at Heathrow Airport as the cons outweigh the pro's. There was some discussion around the idea of having a third runway to ease congestion and the possibility of this reducing emissions by allowing less circling of the airport but ultimately, it was felt that this would not justify the negatives of a third runway.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, a third runway should not be built at Heathrow airport, because although it would help the economy and potentially help get rid of the waiting time for a landing slot it would also add to air pollution and noise pollution for those who live near the flight path.
