# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be some contribution towards university education as it can increase the quality of education but it should not be high. In the future, the government should look into lowering the cost of university education to allow more people to attend and to allow people to contribute to their society more.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, we believe that all university education should be provided at no cost because some people who are academically gifted and from low income families may not be able to afford it. Some may not want to get into debt and therefore may not take an academic pathway post 18 because of this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of free university education. The group felt that everyone should be entitled to a free education to be able to reach their full potential and not be hindered by money. However, the group felt that not everyone would want to go to university and if people do choose to go then they should contribute something towards the cost.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Some universities in the UK should be free but not all of them. If there was free university for all, then the more prestigious universities would still be expensive as there would be more demand to attend these universities and this would cause the prices to rise. Free university education would also attract people who may not be able to cope with the academic demands of university. This would lead to more people dropping out which would be a waste of both money and time. We also think that making university free would encourage people to choose an academic pathway when they may be better suited to an alternative.
