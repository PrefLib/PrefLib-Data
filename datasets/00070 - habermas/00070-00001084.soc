# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to an outright ban on the import of all exotic pets. They felt that the government should instead impose strict regulations on the import of exotic pets, and that these regulations should be strictly enforced. The group felt that the current regulations were not strict enough, and that the current system of self-regulation was not working. The group felt that the current system was open to abuse, and that some people were importing exotic pets for the wrong reasons. The group felt that the current system was not working, and that the government should impose a much stricter system of regulation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to an outright ban on the import of all exotic pets. The group felt that if people were prepared to meet the needs of the animal and had adequate facilities, then there was no reason why they should not be allowed to have them. The group also felt that a list of certain animals that were considered dangerous should be compiled and that these animals should be banned from import. The group felt that this would be a more reasonable approach than an outright ban on all exotic pets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The import of some species is dangerous for both humans and wildlife. For example, many people keep primates as pets, which pose a threat to people's health and to native primates, and reptiles carry a whole range of diseases. It is clear that there should be a ban on the import of primates, and many other species. However, it is important to remember that these animals were born and raised in captivity, and it would be cruel to let them die or put them to sleep.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - An outright ban on importing exotic pets is not a good idea. Some species are only kept as pets, and can never be released into the wild in the UK, and may never even get the chance to breed in captivity. This would also lead to a massive spike in the smuggling of exotic animals as people will still want to own these pets. Instead, we should focus on establishing a legal and ethical importation scheme, perhaps modelled on the existing pet passport system, in which the government regulates the import of exotic animals, ensuring that they pose no risk to native wildlife and that they will be treated well in captivity. This should also make it easier for owners to move with their pets when emigrating.
