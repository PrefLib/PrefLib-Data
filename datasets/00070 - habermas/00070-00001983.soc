# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People should be allowed to give up their UK citizenship. They should be informed of the consequences and what will be required to renounce their citizenship and what the process will be. It should be a difficult and final decision. It would depend on the circumstances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should be allowed to give up their UK citizenship if they feel they no longer want to be associated with the UK, however they should be made aware of the implications of doing so and should be required to go through a rigorous process to ensure they are making the right decision.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of people being allowed to give up their UK citizenship. They thought that it was a personal choice and that people should be allowed to make their own decisions about their citizenship. However, they thought that people should be made aware of the implications of giving up their citizenship and that it should not be an easy process to do so. They also thought that people should not be able to give up their citizenship if they had any outstanding legal issues in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While the decision to give up your UK citizenship is a personal choice, it is important to remember that you may not be able to return to the UK for residency, and you may be forced to give up other passports and citizenships. In addition, it is important to note that once the decision is made, it cannot be reversed. In the current climate, there are likely to be many people seeking to give up their citizenship, but if you have strong family ties to the UK, it may not be the best option for you.
