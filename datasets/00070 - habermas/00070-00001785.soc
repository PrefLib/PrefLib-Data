# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Young people should be allowed to vote in elections. There should not be a set age in which young people can vote, the age should be set based on the maturity level of the individual and their political understanding. Young people need to be educated about voting processes and the political system before they are allowed to vote. Although, teaching them about politics and the voting process does not guarantee that they will use their vote correctly. More attention should be drawn to programs such as the youth parliament, but is should not be a replacement for voting. This may be a good way for younger people to have their voices heard before they can vote.

However, at the age of 16 people may not fully understand the voting process. Therefore, it is necessary to teach young people about the voting process and political systems before they vote.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Young people should be allowed to vote in elections, but there is not one set age in which all young people are able to think for themselves and understand the voting process. Thus there needs to be a higher age of voting. People should be able to vote at around the age of 16, but this is not a set rule. At this age, most people are able to think for themselves and have a wider knowledge of politics. However, at the age of 16 people may not fully understand the voting process. Therefore, it is necessary to teach young people about the voting process and political systems before they vote. Young people should be taught about the voting process and political systems from the age of 14 or so, to prepare them for when they become legally allowed to vote.
