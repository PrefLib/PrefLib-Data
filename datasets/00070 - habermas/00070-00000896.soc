# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the minimum wage. There was some disagreement on the exact amount, with some feeling that it should be £15 and others feeling that it should be a more gradual increase. The group felt that the increase in the minimum wage would help to reduce inequality, reduce poverty and reduce reliance on food banks. The group felt that the increase in the minimum wage would increase inflation, but that this would be a necessary step to improve the lives of the poorest in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of an increase in the minimum wage. However, it was thought that a minimum wage of £15 per hour would be too much of a jump. It was thought that a gradual increase over a number of years would be a more sensible option. It was also thought that a higher minimum wage would help to reduce inequality and poverty in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should increase the minimum wage to £15 per hour. This would help the most vulnerable in society to cope with rising energy costs and to stop food poverty. It would also encourage people to return to or stay in work. The increase would not send inflation out of control as the increase is gradual and it is necessary for the benefit of all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the minimum wage to £15 per hour. The majority of participants thought that it was necessary to help the most vulnerable to cope with rising energy costs and to stop food poverty. The majority of participants also thought that it was necessary to encourage people to return to or stay in work. However, one participant thought that increasing the minimum wage to £15 per hour would not solve our problems, it would only increase inflation.
