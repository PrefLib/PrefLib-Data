# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of autonomous cars being allowed on the roads, but only after extensive testing to ensure safety.  The technology is there already, so it is only a matter of time before this happens anyway.  We must ensure it is a phased approach.  The level of technology has to develop significantly more before we consider autonomous cars for wider public use.  There are so many variables that come into play when a human evaluates how to drive safely, such as adverse weather or having to brake suddenly.  I don't think that machine learning is developed enough to allow autonomous cars yet, especially if there'd be a mix of human and computer drivers on any given road.  Maybe eventually, but not at the moment, unless there is a competent person in the driver's seat to act as a manual override if something in the autonomous car does go wrong.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of allowing autonomous cars on the road, but with some caveats.  The technology is there, and the level of testing that has been done is extensive, so it is only a matter of time before they are allowed on the road.  However, the group felt that the technology is not yet ready to be used by the general public, and that there should be a period of time where they are only used by a select few.  This will allow for any issues to be identified and resolved, and for the public to become more comfortable with the idea.  It was felt that the best way to introduce them would be to have them on the roads in a limited capacity, for example as taxis or delivery vehicles, where the driver can be in the vehicle to take control if anything were to go wrong.  This would allow for the technology to be tested in a real-world environment, but without putting the general public at risk.
