# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although there are good arguments for and against banning the use of single-use plastic bags in the UK, we believe that the use of such bags should be banned as they are very damaging to the environment and have a very negative impact on it. There are many alternatives to single-use plastic bags that can be used, such as bags for life, bagbacks and shopping trolleys, and these should be encouraged and promoted by supermarkets and other retailers. We believe that this ban would not inconvenience too many people as these alternatives are readily available.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Single-use plastic bags should not be banned in the UK, but supermarkets should strongly discourage the use of such bags through cost. Plastic bags are very harmful to the environment, but banning them completely would lead to an increase in the use of other plastic-based products and therefore a large reduction in the number of plastic bags in circulation would be a more effective way of addressing the issue of plastic bag waste. Retailers should have measures in place to recycle plastic bags that are returned to stores, so that the damage to the environment is reduced and awareness is raised among people who use them about the impact that their use has.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although there are good arguments for and against banning the use of single-use plastic bags in the UK, we believe that the use of such bags should be banned as they are very damaging to the environment and have a very negative impact on it. There are many alternatives to single-use plastic bags that can be used, such as bags for life, bagbacks and shopping trolleys, and these should be encouraged and promoted by supermarkets and other retailers. It should be made clear that there are some exceptional circumstances where the use of such bags can be acceptable, and thus they should not be completely banned, but we do agree that in the vast majority of circumstances the use of single-use plastic bags should not be permitted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although there are good arguments for and against banning the use of single-use plastic bags in the UK, we believe that the use of such bags should be banned as they are very damaging to the environment and have a very negative impact on it. We should not wait any longer before enacting such a ban, as the damage to our planet from single-use plastics, such as bags, is rapidly reaching a critical level. Although it may be a small inconvenience to the everyday user, supermarkets and retailers should heavily promote alternative ways of transporting purchases, such as bags for life, bagbacks, and shopping trolleys, and charge higher prices for the few occasions in which single-use bags are really necessary (for instance, if a person does not bring bags to a shop on a 5 minute journey, they can get in their car and make the unnecessary journey again; these bags should be charged at higher prices). A blanket ban can be implemented after alternative options are publicised and set up for users.
