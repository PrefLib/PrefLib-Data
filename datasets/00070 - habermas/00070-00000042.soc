# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a consensus that single-use plastics should be reduced to a minimum. People agree that there are cases where single-use plastics are justified. There is also a consensus that we should try to find alternatives but should also discourage people from using single-use plastics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group was in general in favour of reducing the use of single-use plastics. They agreed that there are cases where plastic use is justified. The group agreed that we should try to find alternatives but should also encourage people to avoid single-use plastics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Single-use plastic is a problem and we should work towards reducing its use. However, there are cases where plastic is necessary. Therefore, we should find better alternatives and discourage people from using single-use plastics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group was in favour of reducing the use of single-use plastics. However, they agreed that there are cases where plastic use is justified (e.g. packaging food that would otherwise spoil). The group agreed that we should try to find alternatives but should also discourage people from using single-use plastics through education, awareness, and financial cost.
