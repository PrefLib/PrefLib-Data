# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A high rate of inequality is bad for society in that the rich keep getting richer while the poor are getting poorer. This can lead to resentment in classes. Society does not function well with splits. Inequality in any part of society is not something that we agree with. We believe that everyone no matter of race, religion or sex should be given the same chances in life. As the world progresses we are seeing more programs and opportunities created for people from all backgrounds and hopefully this will continue.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: A high rate of inequality is bad for society as it can lead to resentment in classes and people may feel like goals are unachievable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Inequality in society is not something that is in any way ideal. Inequality in society is a problem which many countries are still battling with. Society cannot function well if there is a large gap between the rich and the poor. The issue of inequality is in no way something that can be resolved overnight but should be gradually dealt with. The world needs to create more opportunities and programs for those in poorer classes of society to give them a chance to develop. Inequality will not go away until the gap between the classes in society is decreased to an acceptable level.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We agree that the current rate of inequality in Australia is bad for society, as many people from different backgrounds are not given the same opportunities as other.
