# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of a monarchy, however, the current system needs to be changed. The monarch should be ceremonial, and not have any administrative power. The monarch should be held accountable for their actions, and be subject to the law. The current system is outdated and unfair, and the money used to support the monarchy could be better used.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a monarchy, with a few dissenters. The majority of the group felt that the UK is better off with a monarchy than with a president. This is because the UK has a long history of monarchy and it would be a shame to lose this tradition. A monarchy is a symbol of national pride and unity, whereas a president would be just another politician. However, the group did agree that the monarchy should be reformed, and that the royal family should not receive so much money from the taxpayer. The group felt that the royal family should be more open and transparent about their activities. The group also felt that the royal family should be more involved in charitable activities and in promoting the UK abroad.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK would be better off with a president, rather than the monarchy. The monarchy is a toxic, outdated system of privilege, unearned power, racism and they are a drain on tax payer money. If there wasn't a monarchy then the money that is going to support them could go to better use to support the UKs economy and people. If there was a president then they could be held accountable for their actions, something which is not done to an appropriate level with the monarchy. The UK would be better off with a president, rather than the monarchy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the UK would be better off with a monarchy, rather than a President. A monarchy gives the country something to unite behind and provides a sense of tradition that other countries envy. However, the monarchy should not be too powerful and the royal family should not have too much of a say in the running of the country. The royal family should be ceremonial leaders, while the Prime Minister and Parliament should be responsible for the running of the country. The royal family and the Prime Minister should regulate each other, so that neither becomes too powerful.
