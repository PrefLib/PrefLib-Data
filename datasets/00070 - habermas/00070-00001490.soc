# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK is still a Christian country, but the dominance of the religion has reduced. This is due to a drop in practising Christians, as many people are now becoming more spiritual. The UK has also opened its borders to other countries, which has led to a rise in other religions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK is still considered a Christian country with the majority of the population claiming to be Christian. However the actual number of practicing Christians has dropped significantly over recent years. This is due to several reasons including a drop in organised religion and people becoming more spiritual rather than religious. The UK has also opened up its borders to other countries, which has led to the creation of more multicultural towns and cities. With this there has been a rise in other religions, which has reduced the dominance of Christianity in the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although the country is still considered a Christian country, with a high percentage of the population claiming to be Christian, the actual number of practising Christians has dropped significantly over recent years.  This is due to several reasons including a drop in organised religion and people becoming more spiritual rather than religious. The UK has also opened its borders to other countries, which has led to the creation of more multicultural towns and cities. With this, there has been a rise in other religions, which has reduced the dominance of Christianity in the country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have concluded that Britain is a nation that was once considered predominantly Christian, with a large percentage of the population adhering to the religion. However, over recent decades, the number of people actually practicing Christianity has decreased drastically, due to an increase in spirituality and more relaxed views on organised religion. People have become much more accepting of other faiths and religions, making society much more multicultural, and with this has come the introduction of more religions. These reasons have contributed to a decline in Christianity over recent decades and reduced it's dominance in the UK. We agreed to remove the initial statement, considering it too much of a direct quote. We thought it needed more to be said and said in a better way. We agreed that Britain was a country that was once predominantly Christian, and that this is where our information ends, there is no direct proof of what we have said following on from that. We do have evidence of the decline in Christianity from various resources. We researched that since the year 1851 there was a drastic rise in the number of christenings in the UK, right up until the early 2000’s, since when there has been a gradual decline in these numbers, with the number dropping to their lowest
