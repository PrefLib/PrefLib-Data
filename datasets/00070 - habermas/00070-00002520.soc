# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I do not think that people should be allowed to sell their organs on the open market, even is there were stringent laws and practices put in place there would still be abuses of such a market and no doubt the poorest in society would be the ones who would be most abused. I believe it would lead to dangerous practices and medical issues for people down the line. I admit that to those desperate for a transplant themselves or for a loved one may not agree with this stand point but I think there are some lines that we cannot cross as a society and this is one of them. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, definitely not. Unfortunately this world is an extremely unfair place with a lot of economic inequality. I worry that poor people will be forced to sell their organs to live, or that people with alcohol/drug/gambling addiction issues may be forced to sell their organs in order to get money to fund their addictions. I think this will affect the health of poorer people disproportionately. I also worry that people will be coerced to sell their organs and they won't even benefit from it. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: NO, there is no way that people should be able to sell their organs on the open market. This will lead to only the rich having organ transplants whilst the poor will be left behind to die. I carry an organ donor card and want whoever needs my organs the most to get them and not who has the most money. LIfe is not Squid Game.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should not be allowed to sell organs on the open market as it sets a dangerous precedent for wealthy people to be able to harvest organs from the poor. Donors should be adequately compensated for the time they spend donating the organ and recovering from the surgery but I believe this should be ab act of altruism by living donors or organs should be donated after the death or of the donor.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: PEOPLE SHOULD'NT EVEN BE UNDER ANY PRESSURE TO SELL THEIR ORGANS, UNFORTUNATELY THE DESPERATION AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO SURVIVE HAS A STRONG INFLUENCE ON OUR GENERATION.   ALSO, CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT MENTALLY STABLE AND GIVING THESE KINDS OF PERSON THE FREEDOM TO DO AS THEY PLEASE MIGHT JUST BE A LICENSE TO COMMIT HOMICIDES.  ORGAN HARVESTING WOULD BECOME A SENSELESS ACTIVITY IN THE SOCIETY IF LET BE
