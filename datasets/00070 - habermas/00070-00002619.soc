# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I disagree. I believe that this is essentially privatisation of what should be a public right. Whilst the NHS does have extensively long waiting lists for something as necessary and urgent as organs, I believe that it sets a dangerous precedent for the future of our healthcare.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I think this would risk opening up a black market which could lead to people being harmed in order to make money. Instead, I believe all societies should adopt an opt-out system for organ donation. We should be trying to move further away from the idea of profiteering from healthcare and associated issues rather than creating more. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Absolutely not.  People living in poverty may be tempted to sell a kidney and perhaps shorten their own lifespan, either by undergoing the surgery or longer term health issues.  People would be trafficked, to provide spare organs for rich people.  This is not a route I would like society to go.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I would worry that allowing people to do this would result in the exploit of poor and marginalized people, who may feel forced to sell their organs for money. This would widen already existing health inequalities. It would also be incredibly difficult to regulate such a market, and ensure that it was not flooded with poor quality organs that are no use in a medical context. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I don't think that people should be able to sell their organs on the open market. Although I do believe in having freedom of choice, I think that this would be a bad idea because vulnerable people might choose to sell organs out of financial desperation and cause themselves health problems. I think if people were able to sell their organs via a certified medical route instead that it would be a lot safer.
