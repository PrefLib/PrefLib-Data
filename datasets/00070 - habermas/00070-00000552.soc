# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the policies for the United Kingdom should be consistent. However, we agree that different countries should have different policies, to reflect different traditions and different cultures. It is only right that this should be the case, and we support the idea of devolution to reflect this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “I believe that the nations should be able to make their own decisions on some issues, like the free bus travel for over 60’s and free prescriptions.  However, in some areas like education and tax, there should be one policy for all the nations.  This is because the UK is a group of countries who should all be part of the same family.  The different policies also makes things very confusing for people who live near borders of the countries as they don’t know what is going on in each place.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We think that the four countries in the UK should be allowed to have different policies but they should not be allowed to contradict the laws of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is right to have different policies for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, because these countries have different aspects, such as different cultures and different traditions which should be preserved as they are part of the identity of that particular country and is what makes it special and unique. However, these countries are part of the UK so some policies should be adopted across all four countries.  While the nations of the UK are separate in some respects we all belong to a group which should be preserved. In summary, although it is beneficial for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to have their own policies on certain matters, some matters should be common across all four countries as they are part of the UK.
