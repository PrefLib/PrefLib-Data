# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we should not increase the tax on sugary drinks. Sugar-sweetened drinks are already subject to tax to deter excessive consumption and promote healthier life choices. On the other hand the tax disproportionally impacts lower health individuals. I feel like there are other much more pressing issues rather than ther tax on sugar sweetended drinks in the current environment. We should not distort the market by increasing taxes which will create inefficiencies in the market by increasing deadweight loss. The market will be distorted by the application of the tax which will be inconvenient for producers and consumers. Consumers who use drinks in moderation will be unfairly punished for their decisions which is unfair. Consumers may actually switch to a less healthy alternative if the tax is imposed, which could actually worsen the issue that the tax aims to solve by reducing sugary drink consumption. Realistically any increase in tax will be a problem economically and should be avoided if possible. This could also have negative implications for the economy in terms of employment and inward investment into the market with regards to drinks. The obesity crisis is a pressing issue, however, placing an excessive tax on sugary drinks is unlikely to have the desired outcome.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of increasing taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks. The group felt that increasing taxes would not necessarily be effective in reducing obesity levels in the country. Also, the group felt that increasing taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks would disproportionally affect lower income households. The group felt that increasing taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks could have a negative impact on the economy, as it could potentially deter inward investment. The group felt that the sugar-sweetened drinks market is already heavily taxed and increasing the tax would be an unfair burden on consumers. However, the group did feel that more needed to be done to help tackle obesity levels in the country. The group felt that more needed to be done to educate people about healthy lifestyles and the risks of obesity. The group felt that more needed to be done to encourage people to be more physically active. The group felt that more needed to be done to encourage people to eat more healthily.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not increase the tax on sugar-sweetened drinks. Sugar-sweetened drinks are already subject to tax to deter excessive consumption and promote healthier life choices. On the other hand the tax disproportionally impacts lower health individuals. We should not distort the market by increasing taxes which will create inefficiencies in the market by increasing deadweight loss. The market will be distorted by the application of the tax which will be inconvenient for producers and consumers. Consumers who use drinks in moderation will be unfairly punished for their decisions which is unfair.

Realistically any increase in tax will be a problem economically and should be avoided if possible. This could also have negative implications for the economy in terms of employment and inward investment into the market with regards to drinks. This statement goes into detail well about the negative implications of the proposed tax from an economic standpoint and also says why even if the tax is implemented, there may be some negative unintended consequences which could mitigate any potential benefit that is experienced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of taxing sugar-sweetened drinks. The group believed that people should have the freedom to choose what they consume and that people should be responsible for their own choices. The group believed that if people were educated on the health implications of consuming sugar-sweetened drinks that they would make the right choice and that people should not be punished for the choices that they make. The group also believed that increasing taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks would not be effective as it would not deter people from consuming these drinks. The group also believed that if taxes were increased on sugar-sweetened drinks then it would be difficult to stop the tax being increased on other products which are not healthy. The group also believed that increasing taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks would be unfair on people who consume these drinks in moderation. The group believed that if the tax was ring-fenced for a specific purpose then this may make the tax more acceptable.
