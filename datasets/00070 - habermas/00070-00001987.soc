# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that it is important to make it harder to buy a gun. The number of shootings we see in the news on a regular basis is a clear indicator that the level of restrictions on gun ownership is not strict enough. Those who have a genuine use for owning a gun will not mind this change. The only people who should be allowed to own guns are those who are farmers or have other reasons to need them for work or practical purposes. Those who wish to own a gun should have a mental health evaluation before they are allowed to do so, and should have regular evaluations after they are allowed to own one. If someone with a gun license is found to no longer be fit to own a gun, they must return the gun, or face the possibility of having it forcibly taken and destroyed, with legal repercussions. Regular training and knowledge updates are essential for the continuation of the license. We believe this will help us reduce mass killings with guns, especially by mentally ill or troubled people. We believe this would be a good step toward resolving the issue.

The only people who should be allowed to own guns are those who are farmers or have other reasons to need them for work or practical purposes. Those who wish to own a gun should have a mental health evaluation before they are allowed to do so, and should have regular evaluations after they are allowed to own one. This evaluation should be performed by a trained mental health professional, and they should also be trained to recognise the signs of someone with suicidal tendencies. This is because people with guns and suicidal tendencies are more likely to follow through on their suicidal desires. Regular evaluations should take place at least once a year. This is because people's mental health can change drastically over the course of a year and it is important that someone who has suicidal tendencies is not allowed to own a gun.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that there should be a high level of restrictions placed on who is allowed to own a gun, and the basis of this should be an evaluation of ones mental health which is carried out on a regular basis after gaining permission to purchase one. After this, an individual should also receive comprehensive training on the use of the gun in different situations, as well as how to store it away in a safe location. It is no longer necessary in this day and age for people to own a gun if they do not have a practical, valid reason to own one, and people who are allowed to own them should not be under the impression that they are invincible or otherwise dangerous. Most people need not own a gun, and must not be given access to one for reasons which may seem important to them but are in fact impractical. This project was designed to elicit critical thinking about this complex issue, and it was also designed to demonstrate how to generate a meaningful consensus opinion in a group.

Those who wish to own a gun should have a mental health evaluation before they are allowed to do so, and should have regular evaluations after they are allowed to own one. The number of these evaluations should be decided by the person's profession. Those who are training people to use guns should also have regular evaluations.
