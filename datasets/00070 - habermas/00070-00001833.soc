# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should build more wind turbines in the sea as it is a renewable source of energy and will not damage the environment. It will help to reduce the amount of fuel that is burnt and therefore the amount of pollution in the air. It will also help to reduce the amount of energy that is used and therefore the amount of money that is spent. It will also help to reduce the amount of fossil fuels that are used and therefore help to reduce the amount of damage to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should build more wind turbines in the sea as this will provide us with a clean source of energy. The benefits of these are excellent. We know that energy prices are extremely high right now and it is important that we ensure that these are built because it provides electricity without burning any fuel or pollution to the air. The current climate is very negative so the more positive and renewable energy sources that we can build, the more benefits that this will have on all for now and for the future. It provides clean energy which will impact positively on the health of all and the environment. It is cost effective and low costs regardless of how intermittent this source of energy is. They are able to use wind and change it into energy without needing to pay for this. It will also prevent any potential pushback from people who may be affected by them being built near their homes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that we should build more wind turbines in the sea as they will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and produce a renewable source of energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is important to build more wind turbines in the sea to ensure that more renewable energy is used. However, this should not be done at the cost of the local environment, as the turbines can impact on marine life and the local community. It is important to take the opinions of those who live nearby into account, to ensure that the turbines are placed in the most suitable location for everyone. It is also important to use the turbines efficiently, so that the most amount of energy is produced.
