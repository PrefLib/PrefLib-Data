# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the government should provide more funding for public universities. This is because universities are a very important part of society and play a crucial role in shaping the world for future generations. Universities are vital in propelling academic advancements and discoveries forward. They must be sufficiently funded. The increased funding would not only benefit society as a whole but also stimulate the economy. This is important because it would allow people to move to another job by retraining. This would improve the skills of the work force so people can earn more money. This would also improve the amount of research that universities can produce which can solve major global problems such as pollution, global warming or cure diseases.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We all agreed that Universities play an important role in our society. We believe that they are very valuable institutions and believe they should be funded to provide a good education to future generations. However, we were divided on the extent to which universities should be funded by the government. Some of us think that universities are crucial to the economy and would provide a great return on investment for the government, while others thought that the government should be cautious about spending on universities and more focus should be on funding public schools. Overall, we reached a consensus that universities should be funded, but that the extent to which they are funded should be debated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although there are a number of factors to consider, it is agreed that governments should provide more funding for public universities, as they play an integral role in research, teaching and development of the world's workforce. In particular, investment in university infrastructure would ensure future generations have access to high quality education. In addition, the impact universities have on the economy is tremendous. As such, we believe that increased funding would have widespread benefits to society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of increased government funding for public universities. This was because universities play a vital role in society. They are the source of new knowledge and discoveries and are also responsible for training the next generation of workers. This will benefit society as a whole and also stimulate the economy. Universities should be sufficiently funded to allow them to carry out their important work.
