# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should not apply to rejoin the EU. The country voted to leave the EU and this should be respected. It would be too divisive to apply to rejoin the EU. The UK should be trying to find a stable relationship with the EU where we can start to rebuild trade links with the EU and try to offset the negative economic consequences that have resulted from Brexit. There are far more pressing political issues that face our country right now such as the cost of living crisis, public sector pay and a failing NHS. We should be focussing on these issues and not sparking another divisive Brexit debate which causes confusion amongst the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should not apply to rejoin the European Union. The issue of Brexit has caused huge fracture and division within the electorate and by applying to rejoin, this would create further poltical instability. Instead, The UK should be trying to find a stable relationship with the EU where we can start to rebuild trade links with the EU and try to offset the negative economic consequences that have resulted from Brexit. Our country has voted to leave and even though I voted to remain and would prefer that we had stayed in the EU, I think that it would be disastrous for the UK to try and rejoin. There are far more pressing political issues that face our country right now such as the cost of living crisis, public sector pay and a failing NHS. We should be focussing on these issues and not sparking another divisive Brexit debate which causes confusion amongst the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the UK applying to rejoin the EU. The primary reason for this was that the UK had already held a referendum on this issue and the result was to leave the EU. It was felt that this should be respected and that it would be wrong to try and overturn the result of the referendum. It was also felt that there were more important issues that the government should be focussing on, such as the NHS, the cost of living crisis and public sector pay. It was also felt that the EU had shown itself to be ineffective in dealing with the Covid crisis and that it would be better for the UK to try and find a stable relationship with the EU that would allow trade to continue.
