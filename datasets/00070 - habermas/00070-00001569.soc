# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should provide a Universal Basic Income of £1000 per month to everyone. This would initially alleviate poverty for disadvantaged communities, providing them with a safety net to pursue the necessary education and skill building programs. Another benefit of a universal income program would be a simplified welfare system. Additionally, this measure should be implemented in anticipation of new disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, which have already started to threaten certain job sectors. For middle class individuals, a basic income of 1000 GBP per month would also allow them to re-skill or make appropriate career changes towards a more enjoyable type of work for them.
