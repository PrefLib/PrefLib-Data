# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that we should stop giving aid to foreign countries until we can provide the basic requirements for people within our own country. There are many people within the UK that are in need of aid and we should be giving aid to those that are in need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of continuing foreign aid. The group felt that everyone in the world deserved to live a good quality of life and that if we could help, we should. However, the group thought that we needed to help our own people before helping others and that we should make sure we have enough money to help ourselves. The group felt that a solution could be to limit the amount of foreign aid we give or prioritise the countries we give aid to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, we do not think that we should stop giving aid to foreign countries as this would be a selfish act on our part and would harm the global community. We do however believe that we should only give aid where it is needed and to countries who will use the aid appropriately and efficiently. We believe that the global community is a society and as in all societies, some people will have more than others. We should therefore ensure that everyone has access to the basic essentials in life. We must ensure that the aid is not wasted and is used appropriately, we have already seen the consequences of this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should continue to give aid to foreign countries. However, we should be careful how much we give to countries that are in situations of extreme need. We should also be careful not to ignore our own people that are in need. We are all human, we all deserve help when we need it.
