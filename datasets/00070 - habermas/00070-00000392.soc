# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “National service is the worst form of conscription.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - National service should not be enforced by the government. Forcing people to take part in a national service will breed resentment among the population. Everyone should have a choice to make their own life decisions and the government should not interfere. National service can help to promote a sense of national unity, but it will not be as effective if the service is compulsory.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although there are valid arguments for and against compulsory national service, we do not believe that national service should be made compulsory, as this would limit freedom of choice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to national service being compulsory. The group felt that people should be free to choose what they do with their time and that if a person is truly dedicated to serving their country, they would do so of their own free will. However, the group did feel that some people may not have the luxury of choice due to economic constraints. As a result, the group proposed that the government should provide funding for individuals to participate in their chosen national service.
