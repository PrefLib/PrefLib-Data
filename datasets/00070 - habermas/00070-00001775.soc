# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Opinion from Group: We believe that the minimum age should be dropped to 16 years old, as young people are aware of current affairs and are also affected by the laws made.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Young people should be allowed to vote in elections. However, there is not one set age in which all young people are able to think for themselves and understand the voting process. Thus there needs to be a higher age of voting. People should be able to vote at around the age of 16. At this age, most people are able to think for themselves and have a wider knowledge of politics. However, at the age of 16 people may not fully understand the voting process. Therefore, it is necessary to teach young people about the voting process and political systems before they vote.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Young people should be allowed to vote in elections. The minimum age should be 16 years old. This is because young people are aware of what is going on in the world and they should be able to have their say in what is happening.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Young people should be allowed to vote in elections, but not until they reach the age of 18. The current voting age of 18 is a reasonable age to start voting, as this is when most people start to get a job and pay taxes, and are thus more likely to be interested in politics and have a greater understanding of the world. The group felt that it is important that young people are given a voice in the democratic process, but that the views of children should be isolated from those of adults, as they are not yet mature enough to make an informed decision.
