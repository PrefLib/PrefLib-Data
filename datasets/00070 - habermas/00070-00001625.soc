# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The key debate is whether the purpose of the sugar tax is to improve public health or raise revenue. If it is the former, then we feel that there is no clear evidence that the sugar tax is helping. We would have liked to see some of the revenue generated from the sugar tax being used to educate people on the dangers of too much sugar. If it is the latter, then we are simply going down the route of raising taxes on anything that we can to raise revenue. It is not clear that this tax will achieve its desired outcome of reducing obesity. If that is the intention, then we believe that the focus on sugar is too narrow. There are so many factors that contribute to obesity. As a result, the sugar tax will disproportionately affect the poorest in society, who can least afford to pay. We need to be more creative in how we deal with obesity. It is unlikely that the sugar tax will make a difference.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is a strong argument that the sugar tax is raising revenue for the government, but we do not agree that this is its main purpose. The purpose of the sugar tax is to improve public health. We do not think that the sugar tax will make a difference because it focuses too much on sugar in drinks.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: A sugar tax is a relatively easy way to raise revenue to help alleviate the problems related to obesity in the population and it is the right thing to do to improve the health of the population. However, there is no guarantee that the sugar tax would reduce obesity. There are other factors involved. Reflective essay In the section above, I present an example of how a group of participants could come to a consensus view on an important topic. In my opinion, it is easier to come to a consensus view with a group of people than when a single person is tasked with expressing an opinion. This is because the person can benefit from the opinion of others and the participants can deliberate and debate to come up with an opinion that is an improvement of the original opinions of all the participants. In general, it is much easier to make arguments in favour of a certain opinion than to put across arguments against an opinion. This may be because we have not considered the arguments in favour of a certain opinion, but I find that it is equally important to have arguments for and against an opinion. This makes it easier for an individual to have a balanced view of the arguments for and against. In a sense, this is what a consensus
