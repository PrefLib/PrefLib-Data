# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - More nuclear power plants are needed to help to prevent climate change. The reliability of nuclear power plants is very high. They are an extremely efficient way of producing electricity. It is also very clean. However, the waste disposal and the proliferation of nuclear technology are downsides of nuclear power.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “I believe that we should have more nuclear power plants, however I also think that other forms of energy are equally important. I think that it is important that other forms of renewable energy such as wind, wave, solar and hydro power are also explored and incorporated in to our energy supply.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be more nuclear power plants, they would reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help the UK reduce its carbon footprint. However, the risks associated with them need to be carefully considered and more research is needed on how to make them safer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although nuclear energy is a cleaner and more efficient source of energy than fossil fuels, there are major risks associated with the use of this power source. Nuclear energy needs to be carefully managed, so that we can reap the benefits from its use, while also minimising the risks associated with it. I'm afraid this is going to be an essay.
