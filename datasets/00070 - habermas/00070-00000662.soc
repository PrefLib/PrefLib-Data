# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should spend more money on road repairs. Roads are vital to our lifestyles, our economy and most of the things we do and value as a nation. The government should increase funding to the local government to improve our roads and highways immediately. The state of the roads is the worst they have ever been and the pot holes are becoming increasingly dangerous. The bad state of the roads is causing damage to a lot of cars and there is increased dangerous driving as motorists swerve to avoid large potholes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The government should spend more on road repairs as the current state of our roads is a danger to all road users and damaging to our cars. However, there are other important priorities that need funding and therefore the government should not increase funding for road repairs.” This is a typical example of how people reach a consensus opinion after deliberation. The key thing to note is that they did not change their minds to reach a consensus. Instead they each changed the emphasis they placed on different parts of their opinion to reach a common view. This is the key to consensus.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the government spending more on road repairs. Most felt that there were too many dangerous potholes on the roads and that this was a threat to public safety. They felt that the money being spent on road repairs was not adequate to address this problem and that the government should increase funding for road repairs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “In principle the government should spend more on road repairs but in reality there are other priorities which should be given more funding.”
