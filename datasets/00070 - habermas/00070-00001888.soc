# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There are merits to the argument to ban cars in city centres. More could be done to reduce the amount of cars on the road without the need to totally ban cars. The economic consequences of an outright ban outway the green issue and net zero.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final consensus statement: The group were in agreement that a total ban of cars in city centres is not the solution to the problem. It was felt that banning cars completely is a drastic and radical step, and while there are merits to the argument, more could be done to reduce the amount of cars on the road without the need to totally ban cars. It was felt that the cost to people and businesses would be huge, and this would not be a benefit to anyone. The net zero issue was mentioned and it was felt that we should be focussing more on that and not just banning cars.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We don't feel that it's a good idea to ban all cars from the city centre, there's no need. We feel that more efforts should be made to reduce the amount of cars. Further consideration of net zero was needed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group of participants were in agreement that a total ban of cars in city centres is not the solution to the problem. While the environmental and congestion issues are important, it was felt that banning cars completely is a drastic step, and while there are merits to the argument, more could be done to reduce the amount of cars on the road without the need to totally ban cars. It was felt that the cost to people and businesses would be huge, and this would not be a benefit to anyone. The group also felt that the idea of net zero is a good one, but that we should not be focussing on banning cars and that the idea of net zero is a bigger problem than cars in city centres.
