# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK does not need a royal family. It is a tradition that is outdated and the country could function well without it. The royal family brings in money to the country through tourism, but it also costs a lot of money to keep the royal family going. It is also an outdated practice that is not in line with modern day society. The royal family is also given too much privilege and this is unfair to the rest of the population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, the royal family is not needed, but it is beneficial to the UK. The royal family is not needed, as many countries have shown that they can function well as a republic. However, the royal family is beneficial to the UK, as it brings in vast amounts of money through tourism, boosting the economy. The royal family is also beneficial to the UK as it brings communities and countries together. It is also apolitical, meaning it can be much more suitable to represent the country at state occasions such as remembrance occasions or celebrating social causes. The royal family also brings a sense of patriotism and can be seen as a source of continuity which politicians can not.
