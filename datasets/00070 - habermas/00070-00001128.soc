# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to banning right turns in central London. They felt that this would increase journey times, cause traffic chaos and increase the number of frustrated drivers. The group felt that there were more pressing issues that needed to be addressed, such as reducing the number of cars in central London, and increasing the number of cyclists. They felt that this would help to reduce congestion, and improve air quality.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to banning right turns in central London. The participants believed that it would cause more problems than it would solve. The participants did not believe that it would reduce the number of crashes in London. They believed that it would increase journey times and cause congestion. They believed that it would also increase the number of frustrated drivers on the road, and therefore increase the number of aggressive drivers. They believed that it would also increase the number of pedestrians crossing roads, which would increase the number of pedestrians killed in traffic accidents. They believed that it would be very difficult to implement, and that it would cause more problems than it would solve.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We don't believe we should ban right turns in London, but that we should make them safer. It is possible to make them safer without causing the sort of chaos and congestion you described. The technology is already available for making right turns safer. This would be preferable to banning right turns, which could also cause congestion. In fact, the consensus view stated above is very close to what the official policy of the British Government is.  In 2012, the government produced a response to a consultation on introducing bus-only roads in England, in which it said: "We do not believe the evidence supports a policy of banning right turns, or introducing bus-only lanes on the most central radial roads in London. The potential benefits are not justified by the very high costs of implementing such measures." The interesting thing about this statement is that the consensus view of the five participants in the above scenario is actually closer to the government policy than the opinion of any of the participants individually!
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although right turns have caused accidents in central London, it would be too chaotic to ban right turns.  A ban on right turns would cause more congestion and lead to increased journey lengths, so we do not support this idea.
