# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of reducing meat consumption, but not necessarily eliminating it completely. The group also felt that there should be more education on the health benefits of reducing meat consumption, and more education on the environmental impact of meat production.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, eating meat is acceptable. The arguments in favour of meat consumption are that humans have been doing it for thousands of years, we are carnivores, and our digestive systems are suited to eating meat. However, we are not alone in this world, and we must also take into consideration the effect our actions have on the wider environment. Farming meat, especially beef and lamb, has been shown to be damaging to the environment, and there is an increasing drive for people to reduce their meat consumption for this reason. We are all capable of making our own choices about what to eat, and it is up to us to educate ourselves on the effects of our actions. There is also an ethical argument against meat consumption, but again, this is a personal choice, and each person must decide whether to accept the need to kill an animal in order to satisfy their need for meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is acceptable to eat meat, but for some people it is acceptable to eat less meat for ethical, environmental, and health reasons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of eating less meat, but not eliminating it from diets altogether. The group felt that the health benefits of eating less meat would be good for individuals and for the health service, and that it would be good for the environment. However, the group did not want to be judgemental about people who chose to eat meat, and felt that the choice should be left to individuals. The group also felt that the way that meat is produced should be changed, to make it more sustainable and to reduce the impact on the environment.
