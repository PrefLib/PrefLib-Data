# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The participants were in favour of having national referendums on major issues, but only for issues that were important and that most people were interested in. The participants felt that this would increase voter turnout and engagement in politics, as people would be voting on issues they care about. The participants felt that the EU referendum had been a good example of this, as it had increased turnout and made people engage in politics who had not done so before. The participants also felt that referendums would be a good way of making sure that the government was listening to the people and that they would be legally binding. The participants did, however, feel that referendums would not be appropriate for all issues, and that some issues were too complex for the general public to understand. The participants also felt that referendums would not be appropriate for issues that were not likely to be supported by the majority of the public, as this would be a waste of time and money.
