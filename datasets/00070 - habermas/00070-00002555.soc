# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think so as I believe we need more renewable energy, however, I don't have enough knowledge on the subject as to whether or not wind turbines are the most efficient clean option available so I can't really give an informed answer
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: On shore wind farms are good at generating zero-emission energy and would definitely be better than coal or oil power generation. However, on-shore wind farms can take up a lot of land including in areas of natural beauty and would likely make people mad if they were built near their houses. Off-shore wind farms are a better solution as they are more efficient and out of the way of the population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is a great way to create renewable green energy, and they have low operating costs. however, they can also have environmental impacts such as disturbing natural eco systems so it has to be weighed up 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No.  I think the things are ugly to put it mildly.  They ruin the skyline and I just don't like them.  Not sure if they're needed or if they are doing any good.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: yes, yes, yes. right now we are suffering from the impact of increasing energy cost, fears are growing daily. I would except the government to be doing everything in their power to be adding  more on-shore wind turbines. climate control needs to be sorted as our plant is dying. We need these wind turbines. cheap home growers and clean forms of electricity generations
