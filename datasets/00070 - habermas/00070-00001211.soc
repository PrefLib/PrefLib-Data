# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children under 12 should be restricted from seeing harmful content on the internet. This is because they are easily influenced by what they see and hear and are more likely to act upon it. It is also important to protect them from seeing harmful content that may be disturbing and detrimental to their mental health and well being.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should restrict what children under 12 can do and see on the internet. This will reduce the risk of the children being subjected to harmful and inappropriate content.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should restrict what children under 12 can see on the internet, children under 12 are still in their formative years and may not be able to fully understand and process all the information they see on the internet. This may lead to the children being exposed to potentially harmful material that may negatively affect their mental health. It is therefore important for the government to put measures in place to protect children, for example, social media platforms could introduce a function that limits the access of children under 12 to certain types of content such as horror, pornography and violence. This could be done through implementing an age verification system that would require the user to be over 12 before they can access the website. This would ensure that children under 12 would not be exposed to content that is unsuitable for them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children under 12 should not be allowed to see things on the internet that are not age appropriate. This is because they can be easily influenced by what they see and may not have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong. This can lead to them taking part in dangerous activities or being exposed to things that can be harmful to their mental health. The internet can be a very dangerous place for young children and it is important to protect them from this.
