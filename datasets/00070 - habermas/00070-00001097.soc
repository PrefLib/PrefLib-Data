# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Keeping wild animals as pets is a complicated issue. In an ideal world, all animals would be able to live in the wild, in their natural habitat. However, this is not always possible. There are many reasons why an animal may not be able to survive in the wild, such as a lack of survival skills, being unable to integrate into a wild animal group, or being unable to survive in the wild due to a disability. If it is not possible for an animal to be returned to the wild, it may be necessary to keep it as a pet. This should be a last resort, and the animal should be kept in the most spacious enclosure possible, to allow it to live as naturally as possible. The priority should always be to return an animal to the wild if it is at all possible to do so. However, the wellbeing of the animal should always be considered, and if the animal would not be able to survive in the wild, keeping it as a pet may be the only option.

This could be in the form of a wildlife sanctuary, where the animal can live in a protected enclosure, or it could be in the form of returning the animal to the wild.

Keeping a wild animal as a pet should be seen as an absolute last resort and only when there is truly no other alternative.
