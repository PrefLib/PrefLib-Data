# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that the age limit should not be raised to 21. The reason for this is that if the age is raised to 21 then it will be harder for people to purchase tobacco. This could cause people to find other ways of getting their hands on tobacco which could cause more problems in the future. We also believe that if the age is raised to 21 then it will cause more problems for people who are already smoking under the age of 21. This could cause them to seek pleasure elsewhere and could see them increasing alcohol use or even using illegal drugs. We also believe that the legal age for alcohol is 18 and this is too young, people today in society are not mature enough at this age and their decision making isn't good so maybe tobacco use and alcohol use could benefit in an increased purchase age.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The minimum age to purchase tobacco should not be raised to 21. This is because at 18 you become an adult and you should be able to make your own choices and descions on your own life based on your own beliefs and choices. Also at 18 your are grown up and capable of making life choices that may affect your health later in life. If the age was changed then the people under the age of 21 will find other means of getting there hands on tobacco anyway and most likely cause more issues down the line.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The minimum age to purchase tobacco should not be raised to 21. Raising the age to 21 could lead to people who are already smoking to look for other means to purchase tobacco which could lead to them using other illegal substances and also increasing alcohol use. Also if the age was raised to 21 it would mean that people who are 18 and over would be unable to purchase tobacco which could lead to them becoming stressed and anxious and could lead to them developing mental health issues. It is also important to remember that at 18 you become an adult and you should be able to make your own choices and decisions on your own life based on your own beliefs and choices. I think at the minute the age is perfect as at 18 your are grown up and capable of making life choices that may affect your health later in life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the conclusion that the minimum age to purchase tobacco should not be raised to 21. We believe that this is because tobacco is not an illegal substance and therefore the age limit should not be raised. We believe that if the age was raised to 21, people would find other ways to purchase tobacco and this could lead to them committing more serious crimes. We believe that the age limit should stay the same and that the government should focus on other ways to reduce the number of smokers in the UK.
