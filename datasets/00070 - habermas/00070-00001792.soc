# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While it is acceptable for the BBC to use public money to fund the production of television shows, we feel that it would be more beneficial to use advertising revenue in the same way as their competitors. This would mean that the licence fee would not have to be used as an unnecessary form of taxation to produce shows that are irrelevant and of no interest to most of the tax payers. The licence fee should only be used to fund the BBC World News as this is the only form of unbiased news produced by the BBC and is unavailable in the UK without DAB.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We feel that the BBC is an important and respected part of the UK media and it should continue to be funded in the same manner. The BBC has a good record for quality and we feel that it is important that this is maintained.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In principle, the BBC is a good thing. It is an important part of the fabric of the country. It is a world-respected news and entertainment provider. As well as television, they also have an incredible range of radio channels and podcasts. It's also worth pointing out that the license fee also goes to other things - Freeview TV for example. However, the license fee is a form of taxation and in these austere times it is not right to be paying for something that we don't necessarily use. If the BBC is to stay independent of these kinds of influences I cannot see any other way than using public money to ensure that the BBC stays that way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the BBC is a good thing and an important part of the country. However, they should not be using public money to fund television shows. The BBC has a huge amount of money and they should be using this to fund the shows, rather than the public.
