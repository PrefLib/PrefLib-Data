# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The current immigration policy is outdated and needs to be updated. A points-based system would be a good idea, similar to Australia, where people are accepted into the country based on their skills and how much they can contribute to society. We also need to accept people from war zones and other terrible backgrounds and give them a chance at a better life. There can be a balance.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that a more comprehensive immigration policy needs to be implemented in the UK.  The current immigration policy can be quite unclear in some parts and needs to be more specific on certain matters. For example, a more comprehensive immigration policy could provide more information on what evidence is needed to prove an individual’s identity.  This would help to prevent the unlawful actions of illegal immigrants entering the UK under false pretences. It is also necessary to ensure the protection of human rights for people who want to enter the UK, and for those who already live in the UK. A more comprehensive immigration policy could therefore specify what rights are in place for all people, regardless of their race or ethnicity.  It could also make the criteria for entering the UK more specific and in doing so, provide more clarity for individuals and reduce the risk of errors in the immigration system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe the UK needs to adopt a more comprehensive immigration policy. We think the current system is too lax, and that this leads to overcrowding and strains on public services that is not needed. We think a points system similar to Australia would be best, and that people should be accepted who can make a positive impact on society. We think this would be best balanced with accepting people from war zones and other similar backgrounds to give them a chance at a better life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that the current immigration policy is not comprehensive enough. The UK needs to create a more comprehensive immigration policy to ensure human rights, safety and equality needs are met when entering the UK for immigrants. We believe that the current system is too lax and it should be more comprehensive. We think immigration is a positive idea in general but out of control immigration leads to overcrowding and a strain on public services that is not needed. A points system similar to Australia seems a good idea where we accept people that can make a positive impact on society. It is also right to accept people from war zones and other similar terrible backgrounds and give them a chance at a better life. There can be a balance.
