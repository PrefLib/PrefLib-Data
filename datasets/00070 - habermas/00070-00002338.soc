# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “In general, the group was in favour of cutting military spending and increasing spending in the arts and health care. The group felt that military spending was too high and that the money could be better spent elsewhere. However, the group also felt that the military should not be cut completely, and that some money should be spent on the military to ensure that Britain is seen as a strong world power. The group felt that military spending could be reduced to allow for more spending in the arts and health care, but that some military spending should be maintained. The group felt that the arts were very important for the British economy and for the wellbeing of the British people, and that the arts should be better funded. The group felt that health care was very important and that more money should be spent in this area. The group felt that the current NHS system was not working and that the money was not being spent in the right places. The group felt that more money should be spent on the NHS to ensure that the NHS was working efficiently and to ensure that all people in Britain received the best healthcare possible. The group felt that the NHS was very important for the wellbeing of the British people and that more money should be spent in this area.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing spending in the arts and healthcare. They felt that the current system is not working, and that there is a need to invest more in order to make the system more efficient. They also felt that the arts are very important to the British economy and culture, and that there is a need to invest more in order to continue the success of British culture and to support artists. They also felt that there is a need to invest more in the healthcare sector in order to improve the lives of millions of people in the country who are struggling physically or mentally, not to mention more support for hospitals, paramedics, nurses etc. They also felt that the current military spending is far too high and that there is a need to cut down on military spending and to invest this money in the arts and healthcare.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of reducing military spending and increasing spending on the arts and health care. The group agreed that there is a great deal of money being spent on the military that could be better spent on the arts and health care. The group also agreed that military spending is a necessary evil and that we should not cut it entirely, but that the money we spend on it is disproportionate to the benefits it provides. The group agreed that the military is important in the sense that it protects the country, however it is not clear to the group that the military is the best way to protect the country. The group agreed that healthcare and the arts are both vital for the nation's well-being and that they should be supported. The group agreed that the arts are a significant contributor to the economy and provide jobs to many people. The group agreed that the military has a role in providing aid to other countries. The group agreed that the UK should not cut military spending to zero, but that there is scope to reduce it, and that the money saved should be spent on the arts and healthcare.
