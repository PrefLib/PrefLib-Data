# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should absolutely put more funding into primary school teaching. It is the basis of our society and deserves a higher level of funding than many other activities that receive large amounts of funding in other areas. An educated youth is the most important thing for our society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While it is very important that our government puts more funding into primary school teaching, it should also be noted that there are also many areas in our primary school system that need reforming. It is no secret that there are many problems in our education system and that this will not change with the government putting more funding into primary school teaching alone. Primary school teachers need to be paid more, and more support needs to be given to them to help them do their job effectively. If the government put more funding into primary school teaching, this would allow the government to raise the pay of primary school teachers and thus attract more skilled and capable people to this job role. This would also help retain the teachers in this industry, meaning that teachers would not have to change schools regularly. There is also a lack of funding for SEND children, and this would also be able to be resolved with more funding. In addition, the curriculum needs to be reviewed to allow teachers more freedom to teach their students what they want, and this would mean that they would be able to teach their students things that they are passionate about and therefore their students will also become passionate about this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should absolutely put more funding into primary school teaching. Primary school is the basis of our society and deserves a higher level of funding than many other activities that receive large amounts of funding in other areas. An educated youth is the most important thing for our society. The government needs to recognise how difficult the roles inside a primary school can be, and therefore should pay all members of staff what they deserve. They are looking after the future of the nation, and how can we expect to progress as a nation if there is not enough funding to ensure every child receives a top education. The current system is lacking consistency and this has a negative impact on the students, teachers change jobs often and only at the school for a year or so. The infrastructure again is not at a good standard and causes many issues for schools. Beyond this the curriculum is very strict and it feels like not much is done to support individual talents or the arts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group came to the consensus view that we should not be putting more money into primary schools. They are the basis of society and are an important part of the community and children should be given the best start in life.
