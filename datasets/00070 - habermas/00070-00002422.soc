# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of a minimum wage increase, however we felt that the increase should be gradual rather than a sudden increase to £20 per hour. We felt that a sudden increase would be detrimental to businesses and would fuel inflation. A gradual increase would be more manageable and would not have such a negative impact on the economy. We felt that the increase should be gradual and should be increased by a small amount each year. This would be more manageable for businesses and would not fuel inflation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The minimum wage should be raised to £20 per hour. This would help people who are on zero hour contracts or part time work. The minimum wage should be raised as the economy is currently in a good place and it is a good time to do so. It would be good to help people who are on low wages. However, it is important to remember that this would be a huge increase for businesses, especially small businesses. Businesses would not be able to afford to employ people at this rate. The increase would also fuel inflation, which is already high at the moment. It is important to remember that the minimum wage should be raised gradually, rather than a sudden increase.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of a minimum wage increase to £20 per hour. However, it was also felt that the increase should be implemented gradually, over a period of time, rather than all at once. This would give businesses time to adjust to the change and allow for inflation to be kept under control. The group also felt that the increase should be implemented in stages, with the first stage being an increase to £15 per hour, and then a further increase to £20 per hour a year or two later. This would also give the government time to assess the impact of the increase and make any necessary changes to the policy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of a rise in the minimum wage to £20 per hour. The group felt that this would be a positive move for the economy as a whole and would help to reduce the gap between the rich and poor. The group was also of the opinion that this would help to reduce the number of people living in poverty. However, the group did express some concerns that this would lead to an increase in inflation and that this would be detrimental to the economy. The group also expressed concerns that this would lead to an increase in unemployment as employers would be unable to afford to pay their staff the new minimum wage. The group felt that this would be particularly detrimental to small businesses.
