# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the limits on what can be allowed to be broadcast on television should be decided by the free choice of the viewers and be guided by the laws of the country where the television channels are broadcast. However, there should be some kind of censorship when it comes to television shows being broadcast during daytime hours, in order to protect the young, easily influenced minds of children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be some limits on what can be broadcast on television, and these limits should be stricter for daytime than evening hours.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, while we value the freedom of expression and the freedom of the press, there should be limits on what is broadcast on television. We believe that there should be a level of decency and restraint in order to protect viewers from gratuitous violence and explicit content, particularly in the daytime.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There are limits to what should be allowed to be broadcast on television. Certain content such as extreme violence, adult sexual content and other inappropriate themes should be banned from broadcasts during daytime hours when children may be watching. For these reasons, some form of censorship is appropriate in television. There should be less restrictions on adult content in the evening when no children are watching.
