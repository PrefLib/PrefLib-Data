# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We need to teach people to think critically and also hold social media companies accountable for the information they spread.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the law is sufficient to regulate fake news. However, there is an issue with social media companies not taking responsibility for the content they spread. The law should be amended to include social media companies in the same way as traditional news outlets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is a clear need to regulate fake news but the law is a blunt instrument to use to do this. The law should be used to prosecute people who deliberately spread fake news but the law should not be used to decide what is true and what is not. This is the role of the people. We need to teach people to think critically and to make up their own minds on what is true and what is not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is too much fake news and this can be damaging to society. The law is not the best way to address this. It is better to educate people on how to spot fake news and encourage them to think critically. Social media companies should also be held accountable for the information they spread.
