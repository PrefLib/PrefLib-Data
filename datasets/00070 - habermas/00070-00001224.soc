# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that we should reduce carbon emissions as low as possible. If we aim to completely remove all carbon emissions, it will become unattainable and lead to increased disillusionment among citizens and politicians alike. It would be better to aim for reducing carbon emissions as low as possible, so that we can see our hard work being rewarded. Also, we do not know what will happen in the future. With technology evolving rapidly, it is possible that by completely removing carbon emissions, we will be opening ourselves up to new threats that we currently know nothing about. Reducing carbon emissions as low as possible is the most realistic approach that will allow us to make the most positive impact on the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of reducing carbon emissions. The group believed that it was the right thing to do for the planet and for future generations. The group believed that reducing carbon emissions would help reduce the occurrence of natural disasters, as well as improve the air quality. The group believed that it would be impossible to have complete decarbonisation, but the group believed that we should aim to reduce carbon emissions as low as possible in order to protect the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of reducing carbon emissions to a certain point. This is because it is important to consider the impact on the economy, as well as the impact on the environment. The group believed that it is important to strike a balance between the two. The group also believed that it is important to consider the impact on the poorest people in society, as they may not be able to afford to make changes to their lifestyle in order to reduce their carbon footprint. The group also believed that it is important to consider the impact on future generations, and that we should not make the mistake of thinking that we can continue to live the way we do now and that it will not have an impact on future generations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that we should reduce carbon emissions as low as possible. If we all come together and make the right choices, we can help protect our planet for future generations.
