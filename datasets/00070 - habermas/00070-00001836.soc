# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should have a national lottery.  It provides a source of entertainment for the general public and also helps to raise money for charitable causes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the national lottery.  It is a fun way to spend a small amount of money and can be very exciting.  The group was also in favour of the fact that the national lottery raises money for good causes.  The group was in favour of the national lottery, but felt that there should be some sort of cap on the number of tickets that can be bought by one person.  This would stop people spending more money than they can afford on the lottery and becoming addicted to gambling.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe the UK should have a national lottery. It is a very fun thing for people to take part in and although many people do not win, it is a great activity for all. The national lottery also gives a lot of money to charities which is great for those in need. There should be a cap on the number of tickets sold to an individual though, to ensure the fairness of the lottery.
