# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Young people should be encouraged to be entrepreneurs, but in a very supportive way. In some cases they are highly motivated and have great ideas and could really benefit from mentoring. Some may not have any ideas or passion for entrepreneurship and so they should not be forced in to this career choice. The only way to find out is to try. ”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should encourage young people to be entrepreneurs as it can often lead to innovation and further learning for the human race. In the future, the world needs this and currently, it isn't taught enough. We believe there should be an emphasis on this to let kids know there are other avenues to explore and that some people work better in this way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Youth should be encouraged to become entrepreneurs to help the future of the economy. We need new businesses to create more jobs and contribute taxes to society. Young people should be motivated to work hard and be rewarded accordingly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that we should encourage young people to be entrepreneurs as this can help the future of the economy, and also, can often lead to innovation and further learning for the human race in general.
