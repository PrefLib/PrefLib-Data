# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is acceptable to show violence or sex in the media. We have found that these sorts of acts are not being caused by the media and that people who see violence or sex in the media are mature enough to know that they should not act on it. The media also does a good job in advising the viewers of warnings to prevent immature people from seeing it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of showing violence and sex in the media. However, the group was in favour of showing violence and sex in the media to an extent. The group believed that it was important to take in to account the age of the viewership, and that warnings should be posted before or during. The group believed that sex scenes should also be consensual, and violence should have a premise and be part of a larger story, not just random acts of violence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of showing violence and sex in the media. However, it was stressed that the age of the viewer is an important factor to consider. The group felt that if the viewer is young, it is important to ensure that the violence and sex shown is not graphic in nature. It was also felt that it is important to ensure that the violence and sex shown in the media has a premise and is not just random acts of violence or sex.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is acceptable to show sex or violence in the media but only to an extent. The most important thing to consider is who the intended audience is, the younger the viewers the more acceptable the sex and violence shown should be. Also the producers should not glamorise or make the violence and sex the focal point of the production, instead it should be a part of a larger storyline or plot and not used as a form of advertisement or propaganda.
