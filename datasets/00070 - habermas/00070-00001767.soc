# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of EV vehicles as they are better for the environment. However, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed before a widespread switch to EV vehicles is possible. Firstly, the infrastructure for charging the vehicles needs to be in place and this will require a large amount of funding. Secondly, the cost of the vehicles themselves needs to come down as they are currently unaffordable to the majority of the population. Finally, the issue of what to do with the old petrol and diesel cars needs to be addressed as they cannot be simply thrown away.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should not subsidize electric vehicles as it is better to subsidize public transport instead. Public transport is more efficient in terms of reducing carbon emissions and it is also better for society as it allows for a greater sense of community.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of subsidizing EV. The main argument for doing so is that EVs are generally better for the environment than petrol or diesel cars. The major concern that we had is that the poorest sections of society would not be able to afford these cars. The issue is not so much the cost of the car itself but rather the cost of running and maintaining it, which is likely to be much higher for EVs. For example, it will cost a lot more to charge an EV than to fill up a petrol or diesel car. However, this could be offset if the government subsidized the installation of charging points.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should not subsidize electric vehicles over petrol/diesel cars, as it would be too expensive to support this in the long run.
