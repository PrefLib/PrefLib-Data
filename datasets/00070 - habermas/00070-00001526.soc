# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The aim of the National Health Service should be to cure patients with illnesses, but more focus needs to be given to prevention.  In the long run, it would be very costly to spend all of our resources on curing illnesses, especially as we can do so much to prevent illnesses and diseases.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “While the focus of the NHS should be on curing patients with illnesses, there is a strong need for the NHS to focus more on prevention.  We believe that more money should be invested into prevention measures, and this will pay off in the long run.  The first step is to promote the message that prevention is more important than cure.  The next step is to take action, which includes funding campaigns to educate the public about health, including healthy eating and anti-smoking campaigns.  It will also include funding to prevent the transmission of diseases and epidemics.  The government needs to encourage companies to produce and sell healthier food, and to make healthy food more affordable.  To do this, the government can give tax breaks to companies that produce healthier food, and charge higher taxes to companies that produce unhealthy food.  The government can also tax sugary drinks to reduce their consumption, and use the money to fund health campaigns.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “We are all aware that with the advancement of technology, curing illnesses that were once deemed incurable are now possible. While this is great progress, the NHS now needs to shift its focus from cure to prevention in order to really make a difference. This shift must start with a major public health awareness campaign that focuses on preventing illness in the first place. A good place to start is to focus on educating schoolchildren on the importance of a healthy lifestyle.  However, this can only be effective if supermarkets start taking responsibility for reducing their stock of junk food and reducing its price, whilst also increasing their stock of healthy food.  In the next few years, the NHS must begin funding healthier, cheaper alternatives of junk food, such as low-calorie crisps and chewing gum in primary schools.  To prevent the spread of diseases and epidemics, it is also important that we make preventative medicine available to everyone through the NHS.  In particular, we must use our health services to facilitate sexual education lessons for young school children to prevent STIs, and to make vaccinations in general more readily available in schools.”

What is the most important lesson that you have learned? I think the most important lesson I learned is that it is very important to listen to other people’s opinion and take on board other peoples views before reaching a final consensus. 2. What are the benefits of using the Delphi Technique? I think that the Delphi technique works very well in any decision making situation when a group of people have to reach an agreement. This is because the technique allows the group to listen to each other, make amendments to the final consensus statement, and make sure that the group comes to a consensus. 3. How do you feel about the result of the Delphi process? I was very happy
