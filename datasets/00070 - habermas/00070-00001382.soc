# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes. Women should be allowed to serve in the military. Women and men have the right to be treated equally and if a woman wants to serve in the military this should be allowed. Women can play an important role in the military and should be allowed to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although women have a physical disadvantage in terms of strength and speed, they have the right to be treated equally and there will be many who are smarter than the men. Therefore if a woman wants to serve in the military this should be allowed. Women can also play an important role in the military, not in the combat, but in other roles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that men and women should both be allowed to serve in the military. Women have a range of skills that are important in a variety of roles in the military. Furthermore, the military will be a more effective force if it is comprised of people with a range of different skills. By recruiting people from the widest possible pool, the military can get the most capable people for the widest range of roles. By only recruiting men the military will exclude women who are potentially just as capable as men in a variety of different roles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of allowing both men and women to serve in the military. The group felt that the military would benefit from having a diverse workforce and that the skills and abilities of each individual should be considered rather than their gender. The group felt that the military would be able to provide training for the different roles and that this would help improve the military's adaptability. The group also felt that by allowing both men and women to serve in the military, this would help to promote equality in society.
