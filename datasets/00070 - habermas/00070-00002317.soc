# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We are facing a climate emergency and we need to do something about it right now before it's too late for future generations. The world last week hit a record temp and it's killing off wildlife and it's killing people. Natural disasters are increasing both in levels of frequency and devastation, such as the recent wildfires in North America. Governments and private companies responsible for contributing to this emergency are doing little to mitigate any effects, so more groups such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion are having to protest on the streets for just a minute piece of action to be done. I think we are heading into dangerous territory regarding climate change. However, I don't believe very much can be done while consumer demand is so high and big countries such as China are contributing so highly to global warming. The serious effects will be mostly felt by generations to come. as a planet we are definitely facing a climate emergency. with the rise of new technologies in the past 50 years we have relied on fossil fuels. this has meant that the chemicals released are destroying out atmosphere. this has risen at a very face rate. if we dont do things to take action then we will destroy the atmosphere making it unlivable for us
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There is a climate emergency and the world is in crisis. This is evidenced by the increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, and the increase in global temperatures. It is clear that the effects of climate change will be felt by future generations, however, it is also clear that the effects are being felt by people now. This is demonstrated by the recent heatwave in Europe, which has seen temperatures reach record highs and cause devastation and loss of life. The effects of climate change will only get worse if nothing is done to stop it. The world needs to take immediate action to prevent a climate catastrophe.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Climate change is the biggest threat to humanity, and it is getting worse every year. It is vital that we take urgent action now, before it is too late for future generations. The world last week hit a record temp and it's killing off wildlife and it's killing people. Governments and private companies responsible for contributing to this emergency are doing little to mitigate any effects, so more groups such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion are having to protest on the streets for just a minute piece of action to be done. The serious effects will be mostly felt by generations to come.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Climate change is a serious and urgent problem that needs to be addressed. The effects of climate change will be felt by future generations and it is our responsibility to take action now to prevent this. The current rate of change is very fast and the effects are being felt now. The world is heating up and this is causing natural disasters to become more frequent and more devastating. Governments and private companies are doing little to mitigate the effects of climate change and this needs to change. The group of participants came to the consensus view that climate change is a serious and urgent problem that needs to be addressed. The effects of climate change will be felt by future generations and it is our responsibility to take action now to prevent this. The current rate of change is very fast and the effects are being felt now. The world is heating up and this is causing natural disasters to become more frequent and more devastating. Governments and private companies are doing little to mitigate the effects of climate change and this needs to change.
