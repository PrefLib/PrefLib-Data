# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Car manufacturers are primarily responsible for the emissions their cars produce. They design and manufacture the cars and are responsible for ensuring their cars meet emissions targets. Car manufacturers have resisted shifting to alternative types of motors for decades and have actively lobbied against climate change policies and regulations which would force them to make low-emission vehicles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Car manufacturers are primarily responsible for the emissions their cars produce. They design and manufacture the cars and are responsible for ensuring their cars meet emissions targets. Car manufacturers are responsible for researching and testing alternative types of motors that produce fewer emissions. Customers are becoming more environmentally conscious and businesses can benefit from taking a more environmentally friendly approach. Discussion of the process The aim of the exercise was to provide the participants with a very simple way to make decisions as a group. This was achieved by asking them to provide their opinions, allowing them to critique a first draft, and then come up with a final consensus statement based on the critiques. The exercise provided a framework to allow the participants to share their views, hear each other's opinions, and debate until they reached a conclusion. The exercise was a successful one in terms of allowing the participants to explore a topic in detail and reach a consensus, but the process could be refined in future. The process was effective because it allowed all the participants to have a voice in the decision-making process. By listening to all of the opinions, the participants could decide which parts they agreed with and which parts they did not agree with, and ultimately use this information to come to a decision. The process was
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Car manufacturers are primarily responsible for the emissions their cars produce. They design and manufacture the cars and are responsible for ensuring their cars meet emissions targets. Car manufacturers are responsible for researching and testing alternative types of motors that produce fewer emissions. Customers are becoming more environmentally conscious and businesses can benefit from taking a more environmentally friendly approach.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Car manufacturers are primarily responsible for the emissions their cars produce. They design and manufacture the cars and are responsible for ensuring their cars meet emissions targets. Car manufacturers are responsible for researching and testing alternative types of motors that produce fewer emissions. Customers are becoming more environmentally conscious and businesses can benefit from taking a more environmentally friendly approach. Car manufacturers themselves have resisted change and regulation, making them even more at fault for emissions.
