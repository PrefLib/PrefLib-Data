# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A basic income scheme would be beneficial to the economy. It would ensure that everyone has enough income to survive and reduce the number of people living in poverty. This would reduce the burden of the masses on the government and improve the general well-being of the population. However, there are challenges to introducing a basic income scheme. For example, the line would have to be drawn somewhere, and some people would be more in need of a basic income than others. Also, there would be a cost to the government to introduce a basic income scheme. This cost would have to be paid for somehow, and this could be through tax. This could mean that people who are already struggling financially would be paying more tax to support a basic income scheme, which could make their situation worse. However, the tax could be raised from companies that are increasing output whilst decreasing their workforces due to use of AI/automation. This means that the people who are already struggling financially would not be paying more tax to support a basic income scheme, which could make their situation worse.

This could mean that people who are already struggling financially would be paying more tax to support a basic income scheme, which could make their situation worse. However, Governments could increase corporate tax from companies that are increasing output whilst decreasing their workforces due to use of AI/automation. The government would benefit from the basic income scheme due to the fact that those who currently rely on government hand-outs will now pay tax on their new wages. Those who currently pay tax will most likely not benefit from the scheme themselves, but their children could potentially benefit if their jobs are lost in the future to AI/automation. Also, a basic income will mean more people will be able to have their children cared for by both

However, the burden of paying for a basic income scheme for everyone could be funded in part by increased taxes paid by companies who are saving costs by automating their workforce and who can afford to contribute.
