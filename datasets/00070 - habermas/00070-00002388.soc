# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the BBC should be funded entirely by licence fees. This is because it allows the BBC to be impartial, which is essential for non partisan quality programming. This ensures the public can receive good quality and ethical programming from a trusted source. However, the BBC is expensive to run, and may not survive without additional funding, especially in an era of streaming services. If funding is provided by the government, there should be clear policies and transparency in place to ensure this does not lead to any bias in programming - particularly current affairs, news and political discourse. The BBC should also look into other avenues of income, such as marketing of the service they provides to fund the BBC operation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The BBC should not be funded entirely by licence fees. While the licence fee model has allowed the BBC to provide impartial programming, it is an expensive model, and is becoming less viable in the era of streaming services. If the BBC is to survive, it must find alternative sources of funding. If funding is provided by the government, there should be clear policies and transparency in place to ensure this does not lead to any bias in programming - particularly current affairs, news and political discourse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The BBC should not be funded entirely by licence fees. The BBC is a very expensive organisation to run and the licence fee is a very inefficient way to collect revenue. There should be some form of advertising on the BBC to generate revenue. This would be a more efficient way to collect revenue, and would also allow the BBC to generate more revenue. The BBC should also look at other ways to generate revenue, such as through the sale of merchandise, and through the sale of their own streaming services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, the BBC should not be funded entirely by licence fees. The BBC is a trusted and respected source of news and entertainment in the UK, and this is largely due to its impartiality and non partisan stance. This is only possible due to the BBC being funded by licence fees, rather than advertising or government funding. However, the BBC is an expensive organisation to run, and the licence fee may not be sustainable in the long term. The BBC should be exploring other avenues of income, such as advertising or partnerships, in order to ensure its long term survival.
