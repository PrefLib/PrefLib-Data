# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that students should take a foreign language in school, due to the important cultural, economic and social benefits that this will bring. It will also be of benefit to the UK as a whole, if a significant proportion of the population is able to speak a foreign language. The ability to speak a foreign language would enable individuals to more easily travel abroad, which would be of benefit to the UK tourism industry. In addition, if more people in the UK are able to speak foreign languages, this would enable the UK to forge stronger trade links with other countries, which would be of economic benefit. We feel that in a multicultural society, learning a foreign language would allow individuals to learn about other cultures, thereby promoting racial harmony and tolerance. In addition, learning a foreign language would be a useful life skill, as an individual would then be able to communicate with others more easily.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that students should take a foreign language in school.  In today's society the ability to communicate in a foreign language could provide many advantages and should, therefore, be regarded as a beneficial life skill.  Throughout the world, English is generally seen as the dominant international language of communication. Although, English speakers are considered to have a linguistic advantage, we believe that being able to communicate in another language (as well as English) is invaluable and extremely beneficial.  Many people may travel internationally at some point in their life and speaking a foreign language will make these trips more enjoyable as a person can then communicate with the local people. We also feel that having a knowledge of a foreign language will help people to forge stronger links with other countries. In addition, we feel that people should be aware of other cultures and we believe that learning a foreign language will aid in this awareness.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that students should take a foreign language in school, due to the important cultural, economic and social benefits that this will bring. It will also be of benefit to the UK as a whole, if a significant proportion of the population is able to speak a foreign language. The ability to speak a foreign language would enable individuals to more easily travel abroad, which would be of benefit to the UK tourism industry. In addition, if more people in the UK are able to speak foreign languages, this would enable the UK to forge stronger trade links with other countries, which would be of economic benefit. In a multicultural society, learning a foreign language would allow individuals to learn about other cultures, thereby promoting racial harmony and tolerance. In addition, learning a foreign language would be a useful life skill, as an individual would then be able to communicate with others more easily.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Final consensus statement: It would be desirable to for students to take a foreign language in school. The ability to speak another language is a valuable life skill, as this would allow an individual to better communicate with others. In a multicultural society, learning a foreign language would allow individuals to learn about other cultures, thereby promoting racial harmony and tolerance. In addition, knowing another language could be beneficial to the UK economy as it would make it easier to forge trade links with other countries. This would be of benefit to the UK. He: SWITCHING.
