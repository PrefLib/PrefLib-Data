# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, we do not think the number of students accepted to UK universities should be cut. While it is true that universities are inundated with students and there is a limit to the number of people they can accept, there are a lot of ways of addressing this problem. One of the most obvious ways is by offering more teaching support. Another way is to simply increase the number of universities that exist in the UK. This would then mean that there would be more places to accept people and there would be no need to reduce the number of students.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, we do not think the number of students accepted to UK universities should be cut. However, it is true that universities are inundated with students and there is a limit to the number of people they can accept. It is a good thing that more and more people are going to University but something needs to be done about the lack of space. One way of tackling this issue is to expand the number of universities in the UK. If this happens then there will be more space to accommodate the extra students. This will be much better than cutting the number of students accepted to university as it will allow all students the opportunity to continue their education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We don't believe that cutting the number of students accepted to universities is the best way of addressing the problem. In the future, the solution to this problem could be to build more universities in the UK, however, this would require a lot of money to build and then maintain. Until the government has the money to do this, the best way to improve student numbers and student-teacher ratios is by employing more teaching staff. This would allow for more students to be accepted and more attention to be given to the students that are accepted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we do not think the number of students accepted to UK universities should be cut. While it is true that universities are inundated with students and there is a limit to the number of people they can accept, there are a lot of ways of addressing this problem. One of the most obvious ways is by offering more teaching support. Another way is to simply increase the number of universities that exist in the UK.
