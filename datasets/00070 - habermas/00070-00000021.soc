# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the UK government should not subsidize local football clubs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The group came to the consensus view that football clubs should be supported by the government because they create a sense of community and pride and support good mental health. They create a welcoming environment and support small local businesses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We don't believe that the UK government should subsidize local football clubs. Firstly, football clubs are successful businesses in themselves. Secondly, we are of the opinion that the government should not subsidize a luxury, but rather provide the necessary services to the people. The people's money should go towards things that the community as a whole can benefit from, rather than just a small group of individuals. We are of the opinion that money is better spent on necessities and services that the government are responsible for providing. We believe that local football clubs have the means to fund themselves. If this were to happen it could lead to a situation where the local government subsidizes the football clubs and then the football clubs become more important than the people. This would not be good.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the UK government should not subsidize local football clubs. However, if the club is doing a good job in their local community then it could be considered as a worthy case to be given money. This would also need to be decided by the local people in the area.
