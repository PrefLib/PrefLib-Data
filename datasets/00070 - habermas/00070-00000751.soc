# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the BBC should not have an option to increase the licence fee to fund a new BBC news channel. The BBC already has a very good reputation for the news that it provides and there is no need for a new channel. If the BBC did have a new news channel, it would be another reason for the BBC to increase the licence fee. This is not a good idea at a time when people are struggling to make ends meet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the BBC is a good institution, but its quality has been diminishing in recent years. A new BBC News channel would offer an alternative to the other news channels. However, we feel that the BBC should not have the option to increase the licence fee. The BBC already has enough money to be able to fund the new channel.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We don't think that the BBC should have the option to increase the licence fee to fund a new BBC news channel because the BBC already has an abundance of news channels and the new one would just be a waste of money. The new news channel would not be necessary and would only be another way for the BBC to make money.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The BBC should not have the option to increase the licence fee to fund a new BBC news channel. There are already so many news outlets available and it is unnecessary to have another news channel. The BBC would lose the support that they currently have for a large section of the UK if they brought in more fees for something that might be seen as a luxury at a time when people are struggling to feed their families and heat their homes.
