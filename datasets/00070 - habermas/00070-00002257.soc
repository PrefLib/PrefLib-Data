# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, anyone should not be allowed to legally carry a concealed firearm. Firearms are dangerous and only people who are trained to use them should be allowed to carry them. This is to ensure that the firearms are not misused and that they are only used in the appropriate circumstances. The pros of allowing people to carry firearms do not outweigh the cons. The cons are much greater than the pros, for example, if someone who is not trained to use firearms is carrying one, they may accidentally hurt themselves or someone else. The cons of allowing people to carry firearms are much greater than the pros. Therefore, people should not be allowed to carry firearms. There were many positive things I observed during the deliberation process, including everyone contributing to the discussion and being able to put forward their opinions. I think that this consensus opinion has been very well written and does not use repetitive statements. It is quite a short opinion, however it does put forward two sides of the argument.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, anyone should not be allowed to legally carry a concealed firearm. Firearms are dangerous and only people who are trained to use them should be allowed to carry them. This is to ensure that the firearms are not misused and that they are only used in the appropriate circumstances. The pros of allowing people to carry firearms do not outweigh the cons. The cons are much greater than the pros, for example, if someone who is not trained to use firearms is carrying one, they may accidentally hurt themselves or someone else. The cons of allowing people to carry firearms are much greater than the pros. Therefore, people should not be allowed to carry firearms.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, anyone should not be allowed to legally carry a concealed firearm. Firstly, anyone who wishes to use a firearm must be trained and qualified. This is to ensure that these people have the sufficient knowledge of how to use a firearm and when they should and should not use it, and the safest way to use it. Firearms are dangerous if not used properly. If anyone is allowed to carry a concealed firearm, this can be dangerous to everyone. This is because, people who are untrained and unqualified to use firearms can misuse it, resulting in mishandling of the firearm or even mass shootings. Mass shootings could potentially harm hundreds or thousands of innocent people. The likelihood of such things happening is quite likely and can even be seen in countries like the United States of America. Even in some cases, firearm can lead to suicide and self-harm which can harm innocent people. This is why only those trained and qualified to use firearms should be allowed to carry them around. If people without proper training on the use of firearms are allowed to carry firearms around, this could cause the cons of allowing firearms to surpass the benefits of having such. This is why people should not be allowed to carry firearms.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, only the most qualified and well-trained people should be allowed to carry concealed firearm. The pros of allowing more people to carry concealed firearms do not outweigh the cons. Firearms are dangerous and only people who are trained to use them should be allowed to carry them. Final: The point was made that the decision was made not based on the amount of pros and cons, but on the fact that the risk of lives lost as a result of anyone possessing a firearm was too great. We then discussed on what defines 'qualified' people, and came to the conclusion that these people are extremely trained to assess whether or not the situation calls for it, and that without proper training, 'anyone' has the potential to misuse the firearms, even for self-defence, due to the fact that most people aren't as well-trained. We would have liked to mention that cons include potential mass-shootings, hurt to oneself or others, and increase in chance of terrorism, but we felt it wasn't as required to provide more evidence/backing to our statement.
