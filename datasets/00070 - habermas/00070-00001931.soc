# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Consensus statement reached: While it is important that people are able to move around the country to access work and leisure activities, we do not believe it is appropriate to subsidize public transport to the extent that it would be free to use. The cost of living has continued to rise in recent years and so have the costs of running a public transport system, meaning there is a possibility that free public transport would have to be subsidized with the taxpayer’s money which is not a particularly good use of public money when there are so many in society who are suffering. We believe that it is important that the public transport system makes enough profit to help fund future developments and reduce public transport costs for the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While public transport is an important social service that we have access to reliable and efficient public transport, we don't believe it should be free. We think that in the current economic climate it is important that the public transport providers run at a profit so that they can continue to develop new and better systems that everyone can benefit from. We believe that to make public transport completely free would just put a bigger burden on the taxpayer, and that money could be better spent elsewhere in the community. We also believe that it is important to make public transport affordable for everyone, especially those who rely on it to get to and from work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We don't think that public transport should be free, as it would put an unnecessary burden on the taxpayer. However, it is an important social service and should be subsidised to make it affordable for everyone.
