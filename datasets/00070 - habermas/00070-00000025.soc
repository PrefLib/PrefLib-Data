# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The world is rapidly changing in terms of technological advancement and electric cars are just one example of that. Electric cars are the best alternative to petrol-powered cars as they provide a good alternative to harmful fuels that pollute the air and are the leading cause of climate change. The creation of electric cars will hopefully create jobs and make the economy better for the country. However, it is essential that we continue to invest in public transport as it is often the better option for commuters and the more reliable and cheaper option.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Electric cars are the best alternative to petrol-powered cars, when a car is absolutely necessary. In all other situations there are better alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Electric cars can be a better alternative to petrol cars if they are able to provide the driver with enough power for their driving requirements. Electric cars are more eco-friendly than petrol cars and may be a more convenient alternative if mass transit is not available for the specific journeys that they need to make.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Electric cars are a good alternative to petrol-powered cars but there is no perfect alternative to cars, it is more important to just reduce reliance on cars.
