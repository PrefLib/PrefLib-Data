# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We agree that the British government has a moral obligation to support international development, but believe it's important to look at why this is and what the results are.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the British government does have a moral obligation to support international development. As a wealthy country we have a responsibility to use our resources in a way that benefits countries who are worse off than we are. This support allows these countries to improve their economies, subsequently improving the lives of those who live there.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The British government has a moral obligation to support international development. We are a wealthy country and should be giving aid and help to poorer ones. And besides, our aid budget is minuscule.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the British government does have a moral obligation to support international development. As a developed and wealthy country it is important that our resources are used in a way that benefits countries who are worse off than we are. Through our support it will allow these countries to progress and improve their economies, subsequently improving the lives of those who live there. However, this support should not be unconditional. We should not support countries that are hostile to our values, or where the government is corrupt and does not use the money for the good of the people.
