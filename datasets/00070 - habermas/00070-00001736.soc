# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should ban the sale of all things with plastic packaging. We live in an era where we are surrounded by single use plastic items which in turn pollute the environment and damage our ecosystems. It is a global problem that needs to be solved. It is of the upmost importance that the government steps in to resolve this issue and pass legislation that will aid in protecting the environment and reduce the amount of plastic waste and pollution that is generated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that we should decrease the sale of all things with plastic packaging but it is not possible to ban it for some items as they would not be suitable for alternative packaging.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not ban the sale of all things with plastic packaging. Plastic packaging is used for many products, some of which need to be protected and kept fresh. The problem with plastic packaging is that it is not biodegradable. The government should step in and make it easier for people to recycle and there should be an extra tax on things sold on plastic.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Yes, we should ban the sale of all things with plastic packaging. Plastic is a pervasive and devasting issue, causing harm to marine life , eco systems and entering our food chain. by prohibiting the sale of products wrapped in plastic we can reduce the amount of plastic. Recycling plastic alone is not enough. We need to stop producing it. It cannot be left to individuals to choose the "better" option. The government should step in and ban plastic as it is severely detrimental to our environment. We must reduce the amount of plastic packaging. Much of it is unnecessary and is used because it is the cheapest option. It does a lot of harm to the environment and will continue to build until it because a major problem as it lasts too long. There should be an extra tax on things sold on plastic and better incentives for people to recycle, returning plastic bottles to supermarkets etc, it needs to be made easier to recycle, clearer guidance and harsher punishments to those who do not. ”
