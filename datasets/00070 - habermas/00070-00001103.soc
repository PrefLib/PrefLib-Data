# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that there should be a tax on sugary drinks as this will discourage people from buying them. In addition to this, the money that is collected will be able to be used in different ways to help with the obesity crisis. For example, this money could be used to subsidise healthier alternatives to sugary drinks, which would make it easier for people to access and help improve their diet. We also believe that it is important to implement a tax on sugary drinks as this will provide an incentive for companies to change their products in a healthier way. This is important as if companies are not using sugar in their products, people will not be purchasing them. This could help to solve the obesity crisis. However, there should be a reasonable limit to the tax as this will allow people to still be able to purchase the drinks, which they enjoy. In addition to this, we believe that the money raised through this tax should be used to subsidise healthy food, such as fruit and vegetables, which will make them more affordable and accessible for people, as currently these foods are seen as luxury items for many people.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Finally, the group has agreed that we do need a tax on sugary drinks to help reduce the demand of the customers. There should be an overall tax on the drink which is promoted so that there is a message sent to the customers when they’re purchasing the drink that it is not a healthy choice. As the customers will see the tax has been implemented on the drink it will make them think twice about purchasing the drink as they know it is a negative and unhealthy product. The amount of sugar consumed in the UK is at an alarmingly high level and this can be the cause of many diseases and illnesses. We believe that the only people who will really be impacted by the introduction of a tax will be the customers. Not only will this discourage people from purchasing the drink it will encourage people to buy healthier alternatives. As there is an immediate raise of price due to the tax we believe this will be a great way of people eliminating their sugar intake and improving the health of the country. The group also discussed the positive effect which will come as a result of the tax; for example, the amount of revenue which will be created. This money can then be put into other positive ideas, for example, subsidising healthy food and putting
