# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be tighter restrictions on what can be posted on social media. This is to prevent the spread of lies, misinformation and abuse which leads to cyber-bullying and worse, sometimes even leading to deaths. The group believes that this can be achieved by the following: a) The public should be informed about the consequences of spreading lies or untruths and misinformation on social media. b) People should be encouraged to fact-check their information on reputable news sites before posting or sharing on social media. c) Social media companies should develop tools to help fact-check information. d) Social media companies should make their terms of use easier to understand and easier to report to them. e) Social media companies should do more to tackle cyber-bullying by making it easier to report and quickly addressing reported issues. f) Laws should be strengthened to make it easier to take action against abusers on social media.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be tighter restrictions on what can be posted on social media.  People may incite hatred as a result of their comments & may cause people to commit or think about acts of aggression.  People may also create fake stories which also stir up misinformation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People need to be responsible for their own actions, and there is no substitute for good parenting, teaching and guidance on appropriate behaviour.  Therefore, we should not regulate freedom of expression on social media, but instead encourage individuals to take personal responsibility for their actions, and help people of all ages understand the long term implications of their posts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be tighter restrictions on social media to prevent the posting of harmful and misleading content.
