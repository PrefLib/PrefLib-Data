# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although reducing the working week to three days would appear to be beneficial for employees, there are several issues that would need to be addressed prior to this change being implemented. There is a fear that by reducing the working week to 3 days, this would also lead to a significant reduction in the income for the employees, which could in turn lead to an increase in unemployment. The groups participants also felt that a reduction in the working week to 3 days, would also lead to reduced levels of customer service, which would also negatively impact on the profitability of the business. The group agreed that a compromise would be to reduce the working week to 4 days, which would still offer a work life balance to the employees, whilst still being able to provide customer service levels to the customers of the business.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Reducing the working week to 3 days would be too extreme, however, a 4 day working week would provide a more workable solution for both the employees and the business.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - A reduced working week of 3 days to 4 days would be a better option for the British work force, it would enable workers to spend more quality time with their families. However reducing the working week by 3 days would reduce the productivity of the workers and would also have a negative effect on the business customers. This in turn could lead to increase unemployment and reduced profit for business.
