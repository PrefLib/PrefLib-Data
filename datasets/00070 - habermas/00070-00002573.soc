# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes I think all students should have to take a foreign language at school. In the UK, we seriously lack behind other countries with our ability to speak other languages as we assume that we can just get by with English in all walks of life. However, speaking another language not only increases your employability, it also opens so many doors in terms of connecting with other people and cultures in the countries where the chosen foreign language is spoken. It is so enriching to be able to speak another language and allows you to understand more deeply languages and cultures other than English. The more knowledge you have in life, the better you'll be. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I believe students having to take a foreign language in school is important as it starts to teach them about different cultures. If they would not have this they may not be able to understand the differences and similarities between different countries and cultures and I believe this is extremely important. Also it will make students interested in the bigger world and not just their own microcosm.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I believe it's important for everyone to know at least one additional language to English. This will help young people stand out and be able to communicate with other people all over the world. Although a lot of them can definitely speak English too, you immediately make a much better impression and can get a lot more done if you can speak at least a little bit of the local language. This is great for both businesses, how other countries view the UK or even just on holidays.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It depends to what standard. If it is to GCSE then yes i do think but i don't think students should be forced to study a language any further. A basic understanding of a foreign language is a benefit and can assist a student in other subjects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I think teaching another language is good in the sense that it helps encourage people learning about other people's cultures and ways of life. It will also encourage people to visit other countries and become more accepting of a globalized world. However, I think it is somewhat limited in the sense that not everyone who learns a language will then go on to use it. The time could perhaps be spent on more useful studies, such as learning life skills such as improving mental health, consumer rights or how to do taxes.
