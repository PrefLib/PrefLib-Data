# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We generally agree with the draft consensus statement, but believe that it should be made clear that there are some very specific situations where the risks of nuclear energy outweigh the benefits. These are situations in which the nuclear power plant is poorly regulated, and where there is a significant risk of a major earthquake. In all other situations, the potential benefits of nuclear energy outweigh the risks, and we believe that this should be encouraged.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the benefits of nuclear energy outweigh the risks. The risks of nuclear energy are very low and are likely to become even lower in the future as safety regulations continue to improve and the materials used in nuclear energy production become safer. The potential benefits of nuclear energy are huge, and if the world is to avoid the worst effects of climate change, we will need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Nuclear energy is a very cost-effective way of doing this, and is much more environmentally friendly than coal or gas. We should therefore continue to explore the possibilities of nuclear energy and improve safety regulations in order to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and prevent climate change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the benefits of nuclear energy outweigh the risks. The risks of nuclear energy are very low and are likely to become even lower in the future as safety regulations continue to improve and the materials used in nuclear energy production become safer. The potential benefits of nuclear energy are huge, and if the world is to avoid the worst effects of climate change, we will need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Nuclear energy is a very cost-effective way of doing this, and is much more environmentally friendly than coal or gas. Furthermore, those countries that have cut their reliance on fossil fuels are much better off than those who have not, with workers enjoying better prospects and greater security.
