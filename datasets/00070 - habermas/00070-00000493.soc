# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Public transport fares should not be increased and we should not use the extra revenue to provide free public transport for certain people. There are already other means of subsidising public transport and providing free transport for certain people who need it, such as free travel passes. The burden of paying for the public transport system should not be placed upon the users of the system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, public transport fares are already expensive and any increase will make them unaffordable for many. A system should be developed to provide free or discounted transport for those in need, without increasing the cost of fares. The money for this should come from central government and taxes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not increase public transport fares, but if it is increased then there should be free transport for people who are in need of the service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People with lower incomes struggle to pay public transport fares, and that is a major issue, but free transport for certain groups is not the solution. The government needs to step in with more funding to allow people to travel freely, and if the transport companies need to raise their fares, it should be only by a small amount.
