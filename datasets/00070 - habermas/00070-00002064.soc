# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have a responsibility to protect the environment. The environment is where we get our raw materials from, and if it is destroyed then we will be unable to make new things and may run out of resources. In addition, the environment is a place where people can go and relax and enjoy themselves. We should preserve the beauty of the environment for our children, grandchildren and future generations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We think that we have a responsibility to protect the environment for the benefit of future generations. We are destroying the environment and animal habitats which is harming the world for generations to come. The environment is where we get all our raw materials and resources from. We have caused significant damage to the environment. It is essential that we do not continue to harm the environment for future generations and that we protect the ecosystems that we are a part of. The environment has given us so much and it is important that we protect it in return.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in agreement that we have a responsibility to protect the environment for the benefit of future generations.  The environment is the only home that we have and we should try to tread as lightly as possible on this planet.  In return for its care of us, we should also reciprocate.  We should continue to look into global warming to see if its definitely caused by humans or discover if this is a natural occurrence and would happen no matter what we do.  Large levels of deforestation and rising climate are causing the environment to be more important than ever in order to protect the future generations and animals.  Housing developments are  destroying large parts of the environment.  Society has a responsibility to ensure that our behaviour does not do irreversible damage to the environment.  It is important that we preserve resources and look protect wildlife and nature.  Measures should be taken to limit short-term profiteering so that our natural world has survives without disproportionate human impact.  Completely.  As a young person I would love to bring children into the world, however, many people of my generation are discussing whether it is selfish to have children as you are bringing them into a world destined for destruction.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The environment is our only home and the only one we have. It is crucial that we protect it for future generations and we have a responsibility to do so as we are part of the reason it is in the state it is today. We have a responsibility to ensure that our behaviour does not do irreversible damage to the environment. It is important that we preserve resources and look protect wildlife and nature. Measures should be taken to limit short-term profiteering so that our natural world has survives without disproportionate human impact. It is crucial that we protect the environment for us all and for future generations.”
