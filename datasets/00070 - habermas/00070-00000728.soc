# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “A universal basic income would be a good thing to implement in society. It would ensure that everyone is on a level playing field and would help to reduce the income inequality gap in society. It would also help to reduce the welfare bill as people would be more incentivised to work. It would also help people who are struggling to get by and help to reduce poverty. A universal basic income would be beneficial to everyone in society as it would provide a safety net for those who might fall on hard times or go through bad financial experiences. In other countries where this model has been trialled, the results have been very positive so I think it would be worth trialling a scheme in the UK. Working towards a more equal society would have great benefits.”

It would also help to reduce the welfare bill as people would be more incentivised to work. It would also help people who are struggling to get by and help to reduce poverty. However, it is important to note that there are some people who are physically unable to work and therefore would be unable to meet the requirements to receive a universal basic income. It is also important to note that there are some jobs that would not be able to provide a basic income. Therefore, it is important that the government consider all of these factors when deciding whether or not to implement a universal basic income.”

It would also help to reduce the welfare bill as people would be more incentivised to work. It would also help people who are struggling to get by and help to reduce poverty. Research has shown that providing a universal basic income does not reduce the incentive to work and it would help to reduce the welfare bill as people would be more incentivised to work. It would also help people who are struggling to get by and help to reduce poverty.”
