# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that all UK companies with more than 250 employees should be required to disclose their gender pay gap.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that all UK companies with more than 250 employees should be required to disclose their gender pay gap. The gender pay gap is a problem that has gone on for far too long. It is inconceivable that some people are paid less than others for the equivalent work. There should be no distinction. Wages should be transparent and a white male should not be earning more than anyone else because of historic opinions. An organisation of 250 is large enough for information to be relevant and applicable. We need to move towards zero pay gap and people should know that they are being paid the same as someone else - it is not a subject that should be shrouded in secrecy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that all UK companies with more than 250 employees should be required to disclose their gender pay gap. This is because it is only by making the data public that these companies can be held to account. Only by doing this can we uncover the disparities and work for equality and change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that all UK companies with more than 250 employees should be required to disclose their gender pay gap. The gender pay gap is a problem that has gone on for far too long and continues to damage society as a whole and business in particular. It is unconceivable that some people are paid less than others for the equivalent work. There should be no distinction. Wages should be transparent and a white male should not be earning more than anyone else because of historic opinions. An organisation of 250 is large enough for information to be relevant and applicable. We need to move towards zero pay gap and people should know that they are being paid the same as someone else - it is not a subject that should be shrouded in secrecy.
