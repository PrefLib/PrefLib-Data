# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although the arts are important for a healthy and balanced society, and can provide us with pleasure and amusement, and also express our ideas and emotions, at the current time they should not be prioritised for funding. In a world where many people are struggling financially, and many companies are going bankrupt due to the increasing costs of energy, we must prioritise these issues before allocating funds to the arts. If the arts are to be funded, it must be done by private investors or groups that wish to support the arts. A typical consensus was taken in around 30 minutes and included the contributions of 4 participants.
