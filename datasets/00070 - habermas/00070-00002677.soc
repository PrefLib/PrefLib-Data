# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The internet has been a net positive for humanity. The internet has revolutionised the way that people communicate, access information and share knowledge. It has made it easier for people to connect with each other, even across great distances. However, the internet is a double-edged sword and it is important to recognise the negative aspects of the internet as well as the positive. The internet can be used for bullying, exploitation and coercion. It can also be used to spread misinformation and lies, and this can have a negative impact on society. The internet has also had a negative impact on face-to-face interactions, encouraging the development of less complex and more rigid arguments. It is also important to recognise that not everyone has equal access to the internet. The internet has the potential to be a net positive for humanity, but we need to make sure that it is used in a positive way. We also need to make sure that the internet is used in a way that is respectful of people's privacy and personal data.
