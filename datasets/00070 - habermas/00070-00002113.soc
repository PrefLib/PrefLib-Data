# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It was agreed that the NHS should not be scrapped but changes to the current system need to be made to better cater for patients.  It was also agreed that a lot of the funding issues are due to a lack of clarity within the system.  The NHS is made up of a number of companies and departments with many acronyms and a very complicated web of how funds are allocated and spent.  Due to this, it was felt that funding is often directed away from frontline services.  It was felt that mental health services were an area that could be improved on by the NHS but it would require significant changes in both the structure of the system and how funds are allocated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We don't believe the NHS should be scrapped.  We believe the NHS is a fantastic system that has served us well.  We believe the NHS should be funded by the tax system.  We believe the tax system may need to be changed in order to boost funding.  We believe health care should be available to all and not based on your ability to pay for it.  We believe the NHS should embrace the private sector to reduce waiting lists.  We believe there needs to be significant structural changes.  We believe NHS England should be disbanded and regional health organisations implemented.  We believe funding should be directed from NHS England and similar organisations and directed to frontline healthcare services.  We believe mental health services should be completely separate from other NHS services, so the allocation of funding is clear.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No. We should not scrap the NHS. The NHS is a vital part of society and as the cost of living goes up and wages stagnate people will increasingly struggle to afford healthcare. A private healthcare system would not be a viable option for many and health should not be compromised because of a persons economic status.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we should not scrap the NHS. The NHS is a crucial part of the UK's economy and society. It provides healthcare to everyone and is funded by the government through taxes. A private healthcare system would mean that people would have to pay for their healthcare and could not afford it. The NHS needs to be reformed to reduce waiting times and improve the quality of healthcare. Mental health services should be completely separate from other NHS services, so the allocation of funding is clear.
