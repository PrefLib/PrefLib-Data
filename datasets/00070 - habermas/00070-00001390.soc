# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The imperial system of measurement has become archaic and in many ways is a hindrance to efficient communication and measurement. This is particularly true when one compares it to the metric system. The metric system allows for a much easier understanding of measurement as the measurements relate to one another by a factor of ten. Imperial measurements on the other hand have arbitrary relationships to one another and are less easy to learn. While we should not insist that the imperial system of measurement be dropped entirely, it should be phased out and used only in rare circumstances where the use of the metric system would be inappropriate.”

Imperial measurements on the other hand have arbitrary relationships to one another and are less easy to learn. While we should not insist that the imperial system of measurement be dropped entirely, it should be phased out and used only in rare circumstances where the use of the metric system would be inappropriate. This should be done gradually, with enough time for people to get used to metric measurements. It is important to recognise that some people may find it difficult to learn to use the metric system of measurement, and therefore the transition to using only metric should be made slowly and not enforced on people who do not want to use it.”

While we should not insist that the imperial system of measurement be dropped entirely, it should be phased out and used only in rare circumstances where the use of the metric system would be inappropriate. In regards to young people using the metric system, they should not be forced to learn the imperial system as a second system, as it may be inefficient and unnecessary. Instead, they should be educated on the history and function of the imperial system and be made aware of its existence and relationship to the metric system.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “The imperial system of measurement has become archaic and in many ways is a hindrance to efficient communication and measurement. This is particularly true when one compares it to the metric system. The metric system allows for a much easier understanding of measurement as the measurements relate to one another by a factor of ten. Imperial measurements on the other hand have arbitrary relationships to one another and are less easy to learn. While we should not insist that the imperial system of measurement be dropped entirely, it should be phased out and used only in rare circumstances where the use of the metric system would be inappropriate, as this would greatly help to eradicate some confusion. Additionally, this gradual phasing out of the imperial system of measurement would reduce some redundancy in different systems of measurement throughout the world.”
