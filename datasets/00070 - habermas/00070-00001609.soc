# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK's National Health Service is a model that other countries should aspire to. However, the way in which it is run and funded needs to be looked at.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK's National Health Service is a great model to aspire to, however,  it is underfunded and does not have the resources to provide good quality care.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK is a model that other countries should aspire to. It provides free healthcare to every person in the country, no matter how rich or poor. The problem is that the government has not allocated enough funds to the NHS and more people need to be trained in order to keep up with demand. There needs to be more money for preventative care, for example counseling on diet and nutrition, which can save the NHS money in the long term. There needs to be more staffing and equipment to cope with the increasing demand and reduce waiting times for appointments.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK's National Health Service is a model that other countries should aspire to. The NHS is a British institution. It has offered free healthcare to those in need for many years successfully, even though it is stretched to capacity and underfunded. It is already a model in my opinion. We have some of the best trained doctors and surgeons. Our model helps people address health issues at no cost which should be something which every government implements in society. Health is wealth. One should not be privatising or monetising people's need for improving health due to sickness. However, the problem is when this model doesn't work because it is administered or run poorly, or because the government is not assigning enough funds to it. For example in the UK we have a real NHS crisis at the moment, with impossible waiting lists, routine exams being cancelled and essential treatment being postpone to much later. This means that people who cannot afford it are dying unnecessarily.
