# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group of participants were in favour of a global asylum seeking policy that requires nations to take in refugees fleeing war-torn countries. The participants felt that the current situation where some countries have to bear a much larger burden than others is unfair and that the current system is not working. The participants felt that a global asylum seeking policy would be beneficial for refugees as they would have a greater chance of being taken in and would also have a greater chance of finding a place where they would be happy. The participants also felt that a global asylum seeking policy would be beneficial for the countries taking in refugees as they would be able to prepare for the influx of people and also would be able to provide the refugees with the best possible help. The participants felt that the main challenge in implementing a global asylum seeking policy would be deciding how to fairly distribute the refugees. The participants felt that this would be a very difficult task as each country would have different capacities and different capabilities and it would be very difficult to fairly distribute the refugees.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We generally agree with a global asylum seeking policy. In general, the group was in favour of a global asylum seeking policy. The participants felt that the current situation where some countries have to bear a much larger burden than others is unfair and that the current system is not working. The group felt that a global asylum seeking policy would be beneficial for refugees as they would have a greater chance of being taken in and would also have a greater chance of finding a place where they would be happy.

The group felt that this would be a very difficult task as each country would have different capacities and different capabilities and it would be very difficult to fairly distribute the refugees.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group of participants was generally in favour of a global asylum seeking policy, however they felt that there were some issues that needed to be resolved before such a policy could be implemented. The group felt that the current situation where some countries have to bear a much larger burden than others is unfair and that the current system is not working. The group felt that a global asylum seeking policy would be beneficial for refugees as they would have a greater chance of being taken in and would also have a greater chance of finding a place where they would be happy. The group also felt that a global asylum seeking policy would be beneficial for the countries taking in refugees as they would be able to prepare for the influx of people and also would be able to provide the refugees with the best possible help. The group felt that the main challenge in implementing a global asylum seeking policy would be deciding how to fairly distribute the refugees. The group felt that this would be a very difficult task as each country would have different capacities and different capabilities and it would be very difficult to fairly distribute the refugees. The group felt that a potential way to address this issue would be for all countries to agree to take in a certain number of refugees regardless of their circumstances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The participants in general felt that having a global asylum seeking policy is a good idea. The participants felt that refugees are often fleeing from terrible situations and it is important that they are given somewhere safe to live. The participants felt that the current situation where some countries have to bear a much larger burden than others is unfair and that a global asylum seeking policy would be beneficial for the refugees as they would have a greater chance of being taken in and would also have a greater chance of finding a place where they would be happy. The participants also felt that a global asylum seeking policy would be beneficial for the countries taking in refugees as they would be able to prepare for the influx of people and also would be able to provide the refugees with the best possible help. The participants felt that the main challenge in implementing a global asylum seeking policy would be deciding how to fairly distribute the refugees. The participants felt that this would be a very difficult task as each country would have different capacities and different capabilities and it would be very difficult to fairly distribute the refugees. The participants felt that another challenge would be getting countries to agree to take in refugees and that this would be particularly difficult for countries where the population is against taking in refugees.
