# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should not reduce the age at which people can drink alcohol. There is a reason that there is an age limit on alcohol consumption, and that is because alcohol can cause many problems in society. Allowing younger people to consume alcohol will only add to the problems that we already have. Alcohol is a drug, and is addictive. Alcohol causes too many illnesses and addiction can lead to a breakdown in relationships and even violence. No-one under the age of an adult - considered to be 18 - should be drinking alcohol. We should not encourage the drinking of alcohol at all, and certainly not make it freely available to minors.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to lowering the legal drinking age. There was a recognition that alcohol is a legal substance and that it is widely consumed in our society. There was a recognition that alcohol can be consumed in a responsible manner and that many people do not have problems with alcohol. However, the group was also aware that alcohol can be dangerous if not used with some responsibility and that people under the age of 18 are less likely to be to have the life experience to have that. The group felt that there is an age limit for a reason, and allowing younger people to consume alcohol at younger ages is asking for trouble.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Alcohol is a drug and is addictive. It can cause a great deal of damage to both the person who is addicted and their families. It is not just drinking to excess that causes harm but the use of alcohol in moderation can be harmful as well. There are many factors that contribute to alcohol related harm including; the amount of alcohol drunk, the frequency with which it is drunk, whether it is drunk alone or with other people, and whether the person is under the influence of other substances, particularly drugs. Alcohol can contribute to sexual assaults, fights, road traffic accidents, and assaults. It can cause long term health problems including; liver disease, brain damage, increased risk of cancer and diabetes. It is important that young people are educated about the potential harms of alcohol but equally it is important that they are not allowed access to it. Reducing the age at which people can drink would only increase the risk of alcohol related harm.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although there are arguments on both sides of the debate, we believe that the current age at which people can legally purchase alcohol should not be reduced. Our main reasons for this are as follows: 1. Drinking alcohol at an early age can be harmful to health 2. Many people are not responsible with alcohol when they first start drinking, leading to an increase in binge drinking and alcohol related incidents. 3. It is difficult to judge a person's maturity and their ability to drink responsibly. We would not wish to see younger people drinking in a harmful way and alcohol related problems are a real problem that we see in society.
