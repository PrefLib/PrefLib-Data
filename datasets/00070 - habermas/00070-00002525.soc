# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No I think we are taxed enough we are already paying more tax than we did 40 years ago if they want to impose this tax they should first look at reducing income tax to make it easier on the general public
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I believe a carbon tax is warranted, specifically in relation to the most polluting companies and individuals. Currently the blame for climate change is placed on regular individuals who are powerless to do a great deal about it and are just trying to go about their lives. In turn, the most polluting companies and individuals are free to continue doing disproportionate damage to the environment in the name of profit and are protected and even subsidised by the government. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No - the government already taxes us on a number of things.  Wages, everything we purchase, fuel etc - therefore I believe that they are already taxing us for carbon indirectly.  I believe we all have a responsibility to reduce carbon emissions, however to impose yet another tax i believe is unfair.  The government need to review the taxes that they already impose & utilize them on initiatives to reduce carbon emissions. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No i do not believe the government should impose a carbon tax, I believe extra taxation during recessions and cost of living crisis will not help the economy or community to thrive. There are a great deal of alternative measures than can be taken to help the environment such as investment in recycling and sustainable practices. Carbon taxation will drive businesses away from our country and deprive the working class even further.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Yes. I believe global warming and climate change is the most pressing issue of this generation and the next few generations to come. We are in dire need to make significant changes on a societal levels and individual basis. Political decisions in the uk in the last 10 years have been made with more of a focus on Brexit then climate change and as such the government haven't embraced a strong enough policy to combat climate change. A carbon tax, one that is simply not passed directly onto the consumer but shared across the economy, is an affective way to curb CO2 emissions by have a direct financial impact on the individual and the many and can help enact change
