# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should provide subsidies to poorer parts of the UK. This will improve living standards for people living in those areas. Subsidies should be means-tested so that the poorest and most vulnerable receive the help they need. The subsidies should also be for businesses and industries as well as individuals. There should be an equal distribution of wealth across the UK, so that everyone can live with a certain basic standard of living.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should provide subsidies to the poorer parts of the UK, in order to improve living standards for people living in these parts. This will be a good move by the UK government, as everyone will have an equal standard of living, and no one will have to feel left out or excluded from the rest of the country.
