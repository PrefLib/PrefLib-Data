# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although the arts are important for a healthy and balanced society, and can provide us with pleasure and amusement, and also express our ideas and emotions, at the current time they should not be prioritised for funding. In a world where many people are struggling financially, and many companies are going bankrupt due to the increasing costs of energy, we must prioritise these issues before allocating funds to the arts. If the arts are to be funded, it must be done by private investors or groups that wish to support the arts. The questions was from an article in the Guardian.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “Funding for the arts should be maintained, but in a very specific way. In some cases funding may need to be cut in order to protect high-quality arts that are in danger of suffering as a result of lower budgets. The arts are an important part of our society, and the arts in general should be subsidised as much as is necessary to ensure the long-term protection of high-quality arts in the UK.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should spend more money on the arts as it encourages creativity, innovation and different ways of thinking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the arts are not the most important way to spend money in society. However, as long as society is able to fund other important things, then funding the arts should not be a problem. However, if other areas were not funded properly, then this would be a problem. The issue is not so much the cost of the arts, but whether we have enough money to pay for the things that are more important.
