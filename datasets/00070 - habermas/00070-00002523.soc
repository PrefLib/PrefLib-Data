# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I believe we shouldn't use Chinese technology for the most critical national infrastructure as they do have a track record for using spy and malware in basic equipment like phones and apps. So by giving one of the worlds biggest powers all our national secrets would end horribly and could be used against us. Especially when their ideals and alignments are with Russia and North Korea. Giving these power houses our infrastructure and how to destroy us would be detrimental.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - If the Chinese technology is effective and useful, then why shouldn't we adopt it too? I think it's a shame to outsource work that could have gone to national businesses. I wonder if the urge to use "Chinese technology" is to reduce costs - we have tended as a country to outsource work to Asia in order to exploit lower work costs. In general I don't see us using their technology as a security risk because I think all of their processes would be carefully vetted by us before implementation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Critical national infrastructure should only be built / provided by nation states that are close allies. At this current time China does not fall into that category so it's technology shouldn't be used. By using potentially hostile state sponsored technology in our national infrastructure we're opening ourselves up to huge security risks both in short and long term.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I am happy for Britain to use Chinese technology as I cannot see that it makes a difference who provides it. Almost all technology is vulnerable to access and control by a third party or country, the solution is to have appropriate security measures and controls in place to prevent such issues. I would prefer to focus on utilizing the best technology rather than fretting over its origin.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I worry with China and technology in what can be done in the background & what this opens us up to as a nation. I would be wary to use for critical purposes as there is so much that is unknown and not sure how this could put us in a bad position.
