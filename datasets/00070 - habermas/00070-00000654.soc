# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Obesity is a greater health risk than alcoholism. It is a much more wide spread problem and is increasing.  It affects all parts of the body and increases the risk of many different diseases. Alcoholism affects mainly the liver, but also increases the risk of heart disease and mental health issues.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Obesity is a worse health risk than alcoholism. There are more people affected by obesity, and it affects a wider range of health issues. Alcoholism can be managed with willpower, but obesity is more of a problem in today's society. The issue of obesity is likely to become worse, whereas alcoholism is not as big an issue in younger generations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Both obesity and alcoholism are serious health risks and both present a cost to society.  There are more obese people than alcoholics, so in terms of scale obesity will cause more people to have health issues, and will therefore be a larger cost to the health services. However, I believe that obese people, in a sense, only put their own health at risk. Whilst there are fewer alcoholics, their actions have a larger impact on those around them. People who have issues with alcohol may become violent and hurt others. They can cause mental health issues for family and friends who witness their behaviour. Children of alcoholics often have no choice but to live in the same home and suffer years of potential neglect.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the health risk of obesity is greater than that of alcoholism. This is because obesity has been shown to increase the risk of developing many different health conditions, whereas alcoholism only increases the risk of liver disease. In addition, obesity is more common than alcoholism and therefore affects more people.
