# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should subsidize childcare.  Childcare is very expensive and many families cannot afford it.  This puts a strain on families as the mother may have to give up her job to look after the child, or the father may have to give up his job to look after the child.  If the government subsidizes childcare, then the mother and father can both continue working and the family will have more money to spend.  The family will be happier and the child will be better off.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “The government should subsidize childcare.  Raising a child can be expensive and not all parents can afford to raise a child on their own, especially if they must quit their job to do so.  The government needs to help people who are working full time and trying to pay for everything without any support.  If the government does not subsidize childcare, it might become a case of some families not having parents at work because they cannot put their children into childcare.  There needs to be an incentive for working adults to be able to have children, as children are the future of society.  If child raising becomes too expensive then the birth rate will plummet and society will collapse.  To allow parents to continue to work and provide for the children there needs to be help to provide childcare before schooling starts.  Currently child care costs are soaring and the state needs to assist with those costs.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “The government should subsidize childcare, because it is important for the future of society to have parents working and children being cared for in a good environment.  If the government does not subsidize childcare, it might become a case of some families not having parents at work because they cannot put their children into childcare.  The government should help those especially that are in a dire financial situation and who have children to take care of.  There are numerous reasons as to why a parent may struggle with the costs of bringing up a child, and no matter what these reasons are, the child should not be punished for it.  Government aid towards future generations is crucial to the healthy future of the planet as a whole.  Subsidising childcare is a good step towards achieving that.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “The government should subsidize childcare, as the prices of childcare at the moment are unsustainable for the majority of families. The government needs to help people who are working full time and trying to pay for everything without any support.
