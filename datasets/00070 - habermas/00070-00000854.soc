# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the government should not ban vaping. Vaping is less harmful than traditional cigarettes and can be used to help people quit smoking. The government should not ban vaping as this would create a black market for vapes and also lead to people vaping in secret which would be more dangerous.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, the group have decided that the government should not ban vaping. The reasons for this are that vaping is much less harmful than smoking traditional cigarettes and cigars. Therefore, if the government were to ban vaping, people would continue to vape in secret, and this would create an underground supply of vapes, which would be difficult to control. The government should not ban vaping, but instead should not promote it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, the government should not ban vaping. Vaping is a way for many people to reduce how much tobacco they smoke, and therefore banning vaping would just create other problems. As people vape to feed a nicotine addiction, they wouldn't stop vaping if it was banned, but instead they would vape in secret and there would be an underground supply of vapes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, the government should not ban vaping. Although there are some health risks associated with vaping, it is a less harmful alternative to smoking traditional cigarettes and cigars. Banning it would not stop people from vaping, but instead would create an underground supply of vapes, which would be more dangerous as they would be unregulated.
