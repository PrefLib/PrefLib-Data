# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of a higher tax band for people who earn more than £250,000.  We believe that this is necessary to ensure that the wealthiest in society contribute their fair share and to help reduce the inequality gap in our society.  The group also agreed that the government should be held to account for how the money is spent and that it should be used to help the less fortunate.  The group was also in favour of closing the loopholes that the wealthiest in society use to avoid paying their fair share of tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of a higher tax band for those earning over £250,000. This is because they believe that there is a large gap between the income of the richest and poorest people in the UK. The group felt that this would help to reduce the gap between the rich and poor, and would help to reduce poverty. The group felt that it is the moral responsibility of the richest people to help the poorest. The group was in favour of the tax being used to help the poorest, for example by providing more jobs, and by increasing benefits. The group felt that the tax would have to be high enough to ensure that it was worthwhile for the government. They felt that the government would have to ensure that people earning over £250,000 could not avoid paying the tax, for example by using offshore bank accounts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of introducing a higher tax band for people who earn more than £250,000. The reasoning behind this is that the tax system in the UK is unfair and a higher tax band would help to address this issue. The group also felt that people who earn more than £250,000 have enough income to live comfortably from and so it is fair to ask them to contribute more to the state. The group did not think that a higher tax band would have a negative impact on the economy or would cause people to move abroad, but acknowledged that it could reduce the incentive to earn more. The group was in favour of closing tax loopholes and ensuring that taxes were used effectively. The group was of the view that a higher tax band should be introduced, but only if the tax paid by people on low income decreases. Otherwise, there's no point in the government receiving the money on the additional tax when they still don't help the less fortunate people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that a higher tax band should be introduced for people who earn more than £250,000 because there are people struggling on low incomes 10 times less or even more, and there's only so much that you can buy. Once you have a house and above average lifestyle, spending money on unnecessary luxuries while other people cannot afford to eat it's not moral. Thus, we are in favour of introducing a higher tax band for people who earn more than £250,000, but only if the tax paid by people on low income decreases. Otherwise, there's no point in the government receiving the money on the additional tax when they still don't help the less fortunate people.
