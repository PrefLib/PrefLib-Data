# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is not possible for the UK to avoid an increase in its national debt. This is because as the country is already in such debt, it will take many years to pay it back. In addition, it would be impossible for the UK to increase its income in order to start to repay its national debt.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In the current climate, it is not possible for the UK to avoid an increase in its national debt. The government is spending money in all the wrong places and needs to be smarter with its finances. The government is also spending money on things that are not a priority and could be better spent on things that are more important.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK can avoid an increase in its national debt. If the UK could cut unnecessary spending, such as large contracts to big companies which in turn could be put back into the economy and pay off the debt that the government has accrued, then they could avoid further increases. We need to stop sending money abroad and kick start this economy and pay off some of its debt and not continue to borrow. The UK needs to become a more efficient country in how it spends money and cuts where it needs to be cut in order to make the UK a more viable country to live in and do business with.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In the current climate, it is not possible for the UK to avoid an increase in its national debt. The UK is in the midst of a cost of living crisis and people less well off are suffering. The UK needs to step in and offer more support to the vulnerable during these difficult times. The government should be doing everything possible to avoid anymore financial hardship on the working class and those in a vulnerable situation. It is hypocritical for the government to announce national debt increase and pay cuts whilst offering themselves pay increases and tax avoidance in the same sentence.
