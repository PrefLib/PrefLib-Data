# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes. Ultimately bribery leads to corruption and serves only those people with money and those in power. Bribery leads to unfair treatment of the common people. Stricter punishments would lead to less bribery and fairer outcomes for all
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I do not know what the punishment is for a bribe in the UK but by the sound of the question it must not be that strict. I guess it would depend on the level of the bribe that had taken place, what the consequences were etc in order to be able to determine the correct punishment so to speak. The question lacks context and is too general.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I am not sure about this as I do not know what the current punishment is.  I concur that bribes are illegal and should be punished with jail time if required.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - i think that people who pay bribes to free people i can understand.. they want their loved ones to be freed.  If someone had the ability to pay in similar circumstances to be free would you want to deny them and punish them?  I don't think there should be stricter punishments for these circumstances. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I honestly don't have a very strong opinion on this, primarily as i don't know how strict the UK is on corruption, and what the likely sentences are. I do think bribes and corruption should have a severe punishment as they are serious crimes. However I can't comment on whether those sentences should be made more or less severe due to my lack of knowledge on the topic.
