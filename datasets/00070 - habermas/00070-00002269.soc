# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There are enough measures in place to protect citizens. We have the Data Protection Act and the right to privacy under the Human Rights Act 1998. However, the Data Protection Act is sometimes ignored by companies, who often take advantage of people’s ignorance of the law and how to protect themselves. Also, the laws themselves do not keep up with technological advances. As technology advances, new threats to privacy emerge. Social media is a good example of this. The internet allows us to easily connect with people across the world. But this same technology allows people to access and share our personal data with those across the world. It also allows people to invade our privacy and find out information about us that they may not otherwise have been able to access. Another good example is the recent news that the FBI can spy on people using the cameras on their laptops, tablets and phones. This is a new technology that has caused concern among privacy advocates. Although there are many laws that protect citizens, people need to be educated about these laws and how to keep themselves safe. More needs to be done to teach people about their rights to privacy and how they can protect themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There are enough measures in place to protect the privacy of citizens. However, more needs to be done to educate people about their rights to privacy and how they can protect themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Are there enough measures in place to protect the privacy of citizens? As a society, we have the right to privacy under the Human Rights Act 1998. But the ease with which technology allows people to share information means we are more vulnerable to privacy breaches than ever before. The Data Protection Act is sometimes ignored by companies, who take advantage of people’s ignorance of the law and how to protect themselves. The Information Commissioner’s Office recently stated that: ‘There is a significant risk that people will be left behind if technology outpaces privacy law and we need to make sure we are moving forward as a society by examining our laws to make sure they are still fit for purpose’ I think there should be more legislation so that companies and even government agencies cannot take advantage of privacy laws. Individuals should be better educated about privacy laws and how to protect themselves online.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There are enough measures in place to protect the privacy of citizens. We have the Data Protection Act and the right to privacy under the Human Rights Act 1998. However, the Data Protection Act is sometimes ignored by companies, who often take advantage of people’s ignorance of the law and how to protect themselves.
