# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Our Royal Family have been the most powerful, respected and feared monarchs and political rulers in the world for centuries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should continue to have a royal family.  We feel that they are an important part of our culture and heritage and are well respected not only in the UK but all over the world.  They are a huge draw to our country and we feel that they also make our country stand out amongst others in Europe.  We feel as though it's quite dangerous that they are untouchable as they are and that they should feel the consequences of their own actions, as us Brits are tiring of (some of) their behaviour.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: After a long debate, the group have decided that we would like to see the British Royal family continue.  We feel that the role of the British Royal family is highly beneficial to our country as they draw in tourists and are the face of Britain internationally.  While there is always the concern of cost, it is something that I think is outweighed by the benefits.  There are also concerns about the Royal family being out of touch and not being held accountable.  There are a number of ways that we can attempt to fix this issue.  Firstly, we can attempt to make them more accountable to the people and secondly, we can attempt to make them more transparent.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the Royal family is a good thing for the UK. They provide a sense of national pride and are a tourist attraction. However, they should be more accountable for their actions and should not receive any more public funding.
