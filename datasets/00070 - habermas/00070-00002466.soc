# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Cryptocurrencies are a way of the future. Cryptocurrencies are the future of online transactions. There is a clear need for an alternative to traditional currency. We should not ban cryptocurrencies as this will stifle innovation and the free market. We should embrace cryptocurrencies and ensure that the necessary regulation is in place to protect consumers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to a ban on cryptocurrencies. However, the group felt that the cryptocurrency market is very volatile and that people should be aware of this when considering whether to invest in them. The group also felt that it is important that people are protected from fraudsters who might try to sell cryptocurrencies which do not exist. The group felt that the best way to do this is to make sure that people only buy cryptocurrencies from well-known and trusted sources.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, the UK should not ban all cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies should be treated the same as other forms of currency. The cryptocurrency world is a great way of making extra money on the side. It gives freedom of trading and exploring more and more of the crypto world. We should not just be using central bank system. There must be the choice and cryptocurrency is the great way forward.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, the UK should not ban all cryptocurrencies. The group felt that it is not for the government to decide what people can and cannot use to pay for goods and services. They also felt that banning them would be a step backwards as the world is moving towards a cashless society. They felt that there are some people who have made a lot of money from cryptocurrency and it would be unfair to take that away from them.
