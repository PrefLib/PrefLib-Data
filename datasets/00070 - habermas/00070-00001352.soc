# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should be required to learn a second language. Learning a second language can help children to better understand different cultures and the world around them. It will also give them an advantage in the future when looking for jobs. The language taught should be one that is widely used in the world, such as Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Spanish or French. The way languages are taught to children should also be improved to make it more interesting and engaging for children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Children should be required to learn a second language. Learning another language helps children to improve their first language. They also get more knowledge about the world and different cultures. They can also learn to be more independent and confident. The group were given a tool called GroupKit and were tasked with a creative writing challenge.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should be required to learn a second language. It will increase their employability in the future and allow them to communicate with a wider range of people. It will also allow them to understand different cultures better and help them to become more confident. The second language they learn should be a language that is used widely in the world, such as Mandarin, Japanese or Korean, as these languages will be more useful in the future. The way languages are taught to children also needs to be improved, as the current system is not very effective.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that children should be taught a second language as it is increasingly important to speak another language in the modern world. Globalisation has meant that more people than ever before are travelling abroad and therefore will come across people who don't speak English. There are also many job opportunities in foreign countries for people who speak English and so people can work abroad if they speak another language. However, it is the method by which languages are taught to children that needs to be changed. Children should be taught a language from a younger age to ensure that it is picked up quicker and easier, but also they should be taught languages that are useful and in demand, not simply taught a language that the school is experienced at teaching.
