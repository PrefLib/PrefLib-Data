# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Human beings do have a free will, but there are some limits. In many countries, the right of free speech is respected and in these countries human beings can freely express themselves. They can travel wherever they want, speak their minds, and pursue what makes them happy. However, the boundaries that exist in society mean that some limitations on human free will exist.

For example, the dictatorship in North Korea severely limits the free will of the population.

This group would have likely gone through a couple of rounds of the above processes. The documented process is further detailed below. One of the main sources of inspiration and information for this methodology was the book 'The Art of

Discussion This question was the most difficult one to answer. There was a great deal of debate between the participants and there was much emotion involved. One participant refused to continue working on the question and one other participant gave a very radical answer to the question that was not in line with the views of the other participants. This proved to be a difficult situation for the facilitator, as the participant felt that his views were not being respected. The facilitator had to convince the participant to accept
