# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that BBC is a world leading broadcasting company that is trusted by millions of people. We feel that the broadcasting company should be a leader and champion of free speech. While there will always be some people who find some of the broadcasted content offensive, they are most likely a small percentage of the whole. The majority of people trust the BBC and believe that they have the viewers best interest at heart. We feel that it is necessary to show the truth and reality of life, whether some people find it offensive or not. The truth is the most important thing to show and the BBC should be responsible for broadcasting it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is right for the BBC to broadcast content that some people consider to be too offensive, but not if it is unnecessary and has no benefit to viewers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the BBC should broadcast content that some people consider to be too offensive. However, they should take into account the severity of the content and how many people find it offensive. If it is deemed to be too inappropriate for the audience, they should avoid broadcasting it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the BBC should be broadcasting content that some people consider to be too offensive. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the BBC is a public service and should be reflecting the views of the public, not just a select few. Secondly, the BBC is a trusted source of news and information and should not be afraid to show the reality of the world, whether some people like it or not. Thirdly, there are many different views on what is considered to be offensive, and the BBC should not be afraid to show things that some people may find offensive, but others may not. Finally, the BBC is a large organisation with many employees, and it would be very difficult to make everyone happy all of the time. Therefore, it is important that the BBC is willing to show things that some people may find offensive, as long as they are in the public interest.
