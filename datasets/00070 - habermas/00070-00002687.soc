# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should set a target to be carbon neutral by 2050 and start planning to achieve this. However, we also recognise that this will be very difficult to achieve. Therefore, the government needs to provide the necessary support to help individuals, businesses and the wider community to make the necessary changes. This includes support for research into new technologies, providing grants for home improvement, job retraining, and investment in public transport.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK should set a target to be carbon neutral by 2050 as this would help with climate change, greenhouse gases and generally a cleaner country. However, this would require significant changes in industry, transport and energy generation. We would need to increase the use of renewable energy, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and increase the use of public transport. This would require significant investment in infrastructure, transport, energy generation and retraining. The UK would also need to ensure that it was not just offsetting emissions but actually reducing them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral (reach net zero) by 2050. This is an important first step in tackling climate change and will help to ensure that we avoid the worst effects of climate change. The UK should also be clear on how it will go about this. As we learn more, we are discovering that schemes such as carbon offsetting actually contribute very little and can be an example of greenwashing. We need to see schemes that will have a positive impact on British people's lives and livelihoods such as job retraining and grants for home improvement.
