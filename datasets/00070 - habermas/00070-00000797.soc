# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be no border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This is because the people of Northern Ireland should be given the right to vote on whether they would like to remain a part of the United Kingdom or become a part of a United Ireland. This would be a more democratic and just way to decide the fate of the people of Northern Ireland. If the people of Northern Ireland would like to become a part of a United Ireland, there should be no border. If they would like to remain a part of the United Kingdom, there should be no border. If they are indifferent, there should be no border. The people of Northern Ireland are Irish. They always were and always will be. The people of Northern Ireland should have the right to express whether they still want to remain a part of the "United Kingdom". Northern Ireland didn't want Brexit either, so they are in that regard similar to the Republic of Ireland who want strong ties with the EU when Britain's majority voted to leave the EU.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be no border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. There is a long history of tension between the two parts of Ireland and a border would just cause more divide between the two parts instead of bringing them together and therefore could cause more problems from such a divide such as more fighting and potentially deaths. It would also be very difficult to police such a border and the cost and ability to maintain such a border would be high and unlikely to work. Finally we do not see the benefit to such a border, the country has worked fine without one for a long time now and we see no need to put one in place now.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland want to live in peace and harmony with each other. There are some issues that cause conflict and division but these are not as prevalent as they once were. It is in the interest of both countries to have good relations and trade with each other. A border between the two countries would be divisive and would be a constant reminder of a long and bitter past. The border would also be expensive to police and would be difficult to implement effectively. If a border were to be put in place it would be very difficult to remove. Therefore, the participants believe that a border should not be put in place.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - A border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should not be established. This is because there is a history of violence and tensions between the two countries and we do not want this to re-occur. We believe that if the two countries can co-exist and work together then it will be beneficial for both countries. There is no need for a border. However, there is a need to have an agreement in place for any issues that may arise in the future. This can be done through a new referendum or by allowing the citizens of Northern Ireland to decide whether they want to be part of the United Kingdom or part of the Republic of Ireland. If this is done, then we will have a clear idea of how the two countries will co-exist and what laws and regulations will apply.
