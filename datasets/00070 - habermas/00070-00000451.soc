# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The number of migrant workers should be reduced by 10% in the short term. The issue of illegal immigrants needs to be addressed and in the longer term we should look to increase the number of migrant workers by 5% after a year as a means to increase productivity and to fill in gaps in the labour market. We should also seek to ensure that these migrant workers are employed in industries where the impact of them being here will be minimal such as the food processing industry. This will help to address labour shortage in certain industries whilst allowing our local workforce to be employed in industries where they can have a greater impact.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the number of migrant workers allowed into the UK should be decreased, but there should be special provisions to allow entry to migrant workers in industries that are facing staff shortages, such as nursing and the construction industry.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should decrease the number of migrant workers as this will increase the quality of workers and increase the competition for jobs. Also the number of workers coming in from abroad should be decreased as the country is already experiencing a high level of unemployment. The country's wealth should be given to people who were born here, not came here. The views expressed by participant 1 are those of the person writing and not those of anyone else. The views expressed by participant 2 are those of the person writing and not those of anyone else. The views expressed by the group are those of the group and not of any one individual
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group have come to the consensus opinion that we should not change the number of migrant workers allowed into the UK, as we believe that everyone should be allowed to work where they choose, so long as they are willing to play by the same rules as everybody else.
