# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: It is our belief that the House of Lords should be made up of elected representatives. The current system of inherited positions and patronage is outdated and does not reflect the current political climate. In the modern age, it is important that those in positions of power are chosen by the people. This ensures that those in positions of power are held accountable for their actions and are more likely to make decisions that reflect the views of the general public. This is not to say that the opinions of unelected representatives are not valid, but it does place the general public in a position where they do not feel as though they are heard. A democracy should by definition be run by the majority of the people and so the way that the house of lords currently operates is not democratic. A system should be put in place to democratise the process and allow members of the public to vote on those in power.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I believe that it is fundamentally wrong for the majority of the House of Lords to be unelected. In the modern age, and with the progression of civil rights in the UK, it is a political anomaly for people to be able to obtain such a powerful position without the majority support of the general public. This is not to say that the elected members of the house of commons are any less powerful, but it does place the general public in a position where they do not feel as though they are heard. A democracy should by definition be run by the majority of the people and so the way that the house of lords currently operates is not democratic. A system should be put in place to democratise the process and allow members of the public to vote on those in power.

In the modern age, and with the progression of civil rights in the UK, it is a political anomaly for people to be able to obtain such a powerful position without the majority support of the general public.

A democracy should by definition be run by the majority of the people and so the way that the house of lords currently operates is not democratic. The general public need to have more power in politics and so a system should be put in place to democratise the process and allow members of the public to vote on those in power.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is the opinion of the group that the work of the House of Lords should be elected. The current system is outdated and old fashioned and does not match the modern day landscape, so needs to change. In a democracy, the people’s vote is key and in some respects, placing people who have not been voted in by the public has the potential to disempower the public vote. If the general public no longer feel like their voice is being heard, a democracy cannot be upheld. We recognise that part of the Lords’ role is to be able to check the house of commons and that is an important role that should be held, but this can be achieved with a sensible representation of both voices. To achieve a balanced system, a consensus has been reached within the group on the following topics: 1. Appointment of Lords should be by election. Those currently sitting in unelected positions should remain there, but their future successors should be elected by the general public 2.  Their elections should be independent and secure. They should not be swayed by political parties and should have votes on the most pressing political issues 3.  Life appointments should be left alone. This method of election would probably be too expensive to
