# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is not Ok to remove a bike chained to a fence if it is causing damage to the fence, if it is not causing damage it is ok to remove. If a resident is experiencing a repeated problem with bikes being chained to their fence and they have approached the bike owner, they can remove the bike from their fence after a couple of warnings.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is not okay to remove someone's bicycle that is chained to your fence. If you have had problems with bikes being chained to your fence on a number of occasions then the first step is to talk to the bike owner to ask them to find another place to put their bike and make them aware of the potential consequences if they don't remove the bike. If they persist in chaining their bike to your fence after you have spoken to them, then you can consider removing the bike. You should put it in a safe place where the owner will be able to get it when they return to collect it, and inform them why you have removed it. If they refuse to move their bike then you can consider putting it in storage for a small fee (such as at a council storage depot).
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is not OK to remove bicycles chained to your front fence. This is because the bike owner is not causing any damage to your property and is not taking up any space. They are also not making it difficult for you to move your car out of the driveway. This is because the bike owner has no where else to leave their bike and has done so in the hope that it will be safe. They have also chained it to the fence to prevent it from being stolen. It is not fair to remove their bike from the fence as this is their only option.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of people being able to remove bicycles chained to their front fence. However, the group felt that this should be a last resort and that other avenues should be explored first. The group felt that the best way to resolve the issue would be to talk to the bike owner and try and come to some sort of agreement. If this was not possible, the group felt that it would be reasonable to remove the bike, but that it should be put to one side so that the owner could easily collect it.
