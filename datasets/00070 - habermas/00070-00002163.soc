# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Yes, we feel that the government should restrict the amount of alcohol people can buy. The UK has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in Europe and this is having a detrimental effect on peoples health. It is also costing the NHS a lot of money to treat alcohol related illnesses. There are many other countries in Europe that have a much lower rate of alcohol consumption and this is because they have much stricter laws in place to control the sale of alcohol. The government should look to these countries to see how they can replicate their success in the UK.” Experiment Two: Methods and Protocol Another group of participants took part in this discussion and their views were recorded. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft of a consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement by the participants, and the final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: There is one undisputable fact: alcohol consumption is too high in the UK. It is costing the NHS a lot of money and is having a detrimental effect on people’s health, especially in poorer areas of the country. There is also a lot of crime associated with alcohol consumption which needs to be addressed. It seems to me that it may be the system in which alcohol is sold and the advertising of alcohol that is contributing to the problem. Supermarkets should not be allowed to sell alcohol at such cheap prices and the advertising of alcohol needs to be regulated so that it does not glamourise excessive drinking. More needs to be done to tackle the problem of alcohol abuse and reduction in sales, not an increase in regulation, is the way forward to achieve this goal.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Yes, the government should restrict the amount of alcohol people can buy.

There are many other countries in Europe that have a much lower rate of alcohol consumption and this is because they have much stricter laws in place to control the sale of alcohol. The government should look to these countries to see how they can replicate their success in the UK. A recent study in the British Medical Journal showed that a 10% increase in the price of alcohol led to a 2% reduction in alcohol related deaths. This is very good evidence to show that restricting the amount of alcohol people can buy will lead to better health and save the NHS a lot of money. The money saved can then be spent on more important things such as funding mental health services and supporting people with alcohol addiction.”
