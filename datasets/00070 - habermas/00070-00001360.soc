# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK is becoming more like the USA in terms of unemployment and cuts to the public sector. The USA is also more radical in terms of economic policies and this has had an effect on the UK's economic policies. There is an increase in political power of corporations and less power for the people. Also, the number of crimes are increasing in both countries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the UK is becoming more like the USA, but in specific areas, the UK is still very different from the USA. The UK is becoming more like the USA in terms of social issues, such as the increase in racial discrimination and gun violence. The UK is also becoming more like the USA in terms of the economy, with the increase in low wage and low hours jobs, as well as the greater power of corporations. However, the UK is still very different from the USA in terms of the political system, with the UK having a parliamentary system, whereas the USA has a presidential system. The UK is also very different from the USA in terms of culture, food, habits, and politics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the UK is becoming more like the USA. However, there are still differences in terms of culture, food, habits, politics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK is becoming more like the USA in that the economy is very much controlled by big corporations, and the government is always striving to be more like the USA. More and more corporations have to try and look after their profits, and cut wages and hours for their workers, in order to keep their business running. The political system of the UK is very different from the US, but the politics are slowly becoming more similar, especially the recent rhetoric that has been spread from the right wing and the left wing. The media, however, is very different, in that it is much more honest in the UK, and is not always focusing on the bad side of things, like the US media.
