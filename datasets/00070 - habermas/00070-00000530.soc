# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group came to the consensus view that it is not the government's responsibility to fund and create more free parking spaces.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the government to fund and create more free parking spaces, as it is a nationwide issue.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the government has the responsibility to fund and create more free parking spaces in the UK as free parking spaces is a right for people who owns cars. In order to help the council, car owners should pay an extra fee for their car tax so that they contribute to the parking fees in some way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should create more free parking spaces. They should play a big part in creating free spaces but also give responsibility to local companies who can make a profit from doing so. The government should also subsidise parking space to make it cheaper.
