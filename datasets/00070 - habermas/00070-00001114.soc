# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be more open discussion about the use of recreational drugs. It is important to educate people on the potentially harmful side effects of recreational drugs. People need to understand that there are some risks to their health and their social interactions. Some recreational drugs are not very safe to use and some can be highly addictive and people should be aware of the risks. Some recreational drugs are safer than others. It is wrong to use recreational drugs if you are pregnant and this is highly dangerous to the baby and could result in the child having serious medical problems. It is not a good idea to try drugs, even once, as you could become addicted. However it is up to the individual to decide for themselves if they wish to take recreational drugs. It is not for the law to tell people what to do and what not to do, especially if there is no victim. However, it is up to people to take responsibility for their own actions and understand the potential risks to themselves and their family and friends. It should also be noted that some recreational drugs have been found to be beneficial in small doses for the treatment of certain conditions and so should be considered for their individual benefits and harms.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be more open discussion about the effects of drugs. Some recreational drugs have the potential to be harmful but some are not so bad and are safer than others. There should be a move away from criminalisation of drugs for personal use and instead a move towards helping people and ensuring they are fully aware of the risks and the potential consequences. Some drugs are more addictive than others and some can cause serious damage to a developing foetus.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final consensus statement: The law should not prohibit victimless crimes. However it is important to educate people on the potentially harmful side effects of recreational drugs. People need to understand that there are some risks to their health and their social interactions. Some recreational drugs are not very safe to use and some can be highly addictive and people should be aware of the risks. Some recreational drugs are safer than others.
