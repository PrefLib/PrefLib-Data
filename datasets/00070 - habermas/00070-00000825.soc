# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, it is not time to abandon the metric system and return to the imperial system. Whilst we all have our own views on the matter, it is clear that the metric system is used by most countries around the world, and it would make little sense to go back to the imperial system. We have already come to a consensus in the UK to use a mixture of both systems, and I think that is the best option for us.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It would be counterproductive to abandon the metric system now. It is the world standard and is used in most countries. This would cause more problems than it would solve. The imperial system is not without its faults. It is less precise and harder to use. We would be better served to stick with what we have now. In this example, the group of participants came to the following consensus statement: It would be counterproductive to abandon the metric system now. It is the world standard and is used in most countries. This would cause more problems than it would solve. The imperial system is not without its faults. It is less precise and harder to use. We would be better served to stick with what we have now.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is no need to change back to the imperial system now, and to do so would be a step backwards. The cost and hassle of switching back now are too great, and the metric system is the way of the future. It is the most used system in the world, and to revert back now would be to make the UK seem like a backwards nation. It would be better to make the most of the metric system, and to work on making it better, rather than trying to make the old imperial system work in a new world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is no need to abandon the metric system and return to the imperial system. The metric system is used by the majority of countries and is much easier to understand. The cost and hassle involved in switching back now make it unnecessary.
