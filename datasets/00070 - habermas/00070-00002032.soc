# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While it is important for the government to try and reduce the burden on the NHS, we do not believe that mandating businesses to contribute is the best way to go about this. It is true that the extra costs on businesses would contribute to the welfare of the country and its citizens, however, there are other ways to achieve this without burdening businesses. For example, taxing businesses and individuals more, or adding a health surcharge on unhealthy foods and products would allow for the same results to be achieved without taxing businesses directly. We understand the argument for taxing businesses is that the money is not just going into the NHS, but also into government welfare, however, the taxes from businesses are still contributing to the NHS and, as a result, this would still help reduce the burden on the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although there are arguments on both sides of the spectrum, we believe that the government should mandate that businesses contribute to a fund to provide universal health care. However, the scheme must be fair and apply to all organisations. The principle that employers have a duty of care to their employees is vital to maintaining the health and productivity of workers. Moreover, by incentivising workers through healthcare, businesses can foster a more positive workplace environment.  From a practical standpoint, a universal health care system is an important component of healthcare, and as such, businesses will always have to contribute in some form.  As this is the case, businesses should have a say in how their contributions are used. Conclusion I believe that this experience was important as it showed that everyone can come together to form a cohesive opinion. It shows that as long as you listen to other's opinions, you can create a constructive dialogue that leads to a favourable conclusion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Businesses should not be mandated to contribute to UHC. This is because it would impact smaller businesses more than larger ones, and this would not be fair. Also, if businesses were mandated to contribute to UHC, they may find ways of avoiding it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Businesses should not be mandated to contribute to a fund to provide universal health care. They already contribute through their corporate tax. The government should not be able to mandate businesses to contribute to a fund that provides health care as it would be an extra financial burden on businesses, especially smaller businesses. The government should not be able to mandate businesses to contribute to a fund that provides health care as businesses have worked hard to get to where they are. It is unfair that they should be made to pay higher taxes to support fully able people who are too lazy to get a job. Businesses should not be mandated to contribute to a fund that provides health care as it is important that businesses have a duty of care to their employees, and there is mutual benefit for both parties involved. There should possibly be a scale whereby tenure is linked to the extent of coverage, with a probationary period not allowing for coverage. It is key to the operations of an organisation that its employees are in good health and are able to access healthcare provision.
