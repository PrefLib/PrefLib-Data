# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, we should increase the tax rate on people who earn above a certain amount. The current system of taxation is outdated and does not take into account the cost of living and the inequality of wealth in the UK. By increasing the tax rate on the higher earners, it would allow increased funding for social welfare and services across the UK, such as the NHS. It would make society fairer, allow wealth to distribute among classes and would also allow people to contribute to the economy in a way that is proportional to their income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that we should increase the tax rate on people who earn above a certain amount. This is because we believe that everyone should contribute to society and pay their fair share. The rich benefit greatly from society as a whole and they should contribute a proportional amount in taxes. We also believe that the increase in taxes for those who earn above a certain amount will allow for greater investment in social welfare and services such as the NHS. The funds will be used to help those who are in need in society and will be used to give those who are struggling a helping hand. The higher taxes will also create a fairer society as wealth will distribute more evenly and will help reduce classism and inequality.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Tax the rich. They’re the ones with the money. It’s only fair. They’re more than capable of giving more than the average person. The tax should be taken from the rich and put back into helping people who can’t afford their lifestyles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of increasing the tax rate on people who earn above a certain amount. The group felt that this would help to reduce the gap between the rich and poor in society and would help to reduce poverty. The group felt that this would also help to improve public services such as the NHS.
