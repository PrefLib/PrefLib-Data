# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: The government needs to do more to help young people who are struggling to buy a house. House prices are far higher than wages and are rising at a far greater rate than salaries for young people. Young people will therefore never be able to afford to buy a house unless they are in a very fortunate position. The government needs to build more affordable housing and implement schemes to help people get onto the property ladder. This could include the government gifting money towards the deposit of first time buyers and even paying the interest on their mortgages for a few years, allowing them to build up enough equity in the property to get their own mortgage or loan. The government could also make some changes to stamp duty, such as having a higher threshold and a lower tax rate to save people money. A house building scheme would be much more effective and help a lot more people. There are currently schemes and help available, but none of these are truly effective. Therefore, the government needs to put more focus on the most effective policies and implement them, rather than ploughing money into ineffective schemes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There is an urgent need for the government to do more to help young people who are struggling to buy a house. House prices have sky rocketed in the last 10 years and young people are being priced out of the housing market. This is a result of not enough houses being built and the government needs to make a significant effort to increase the supply of housing. A house building scheme would be the most effective way of solving this problem. However, the government could also implement schemes to help young people get onto the property ladder. This could include the government gifting money towards the deposit of first time buyers and even paying the interest on their mortgages for a few years, allowing them to build up enough equity in the property to get their own mortgage or loan. The government could also make some changes to stamp duty, such as having a higher threshold and a lower tax rate to save people money. However, a house building scheme would be much more effective and help a lot more people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should do more to help young people struggling to buy a house, although I personally wouldn’t say the government 'needed' to. I would add that it’s not just young people who are being forced out of the housing market, but people of all ages and backgrounds who are struggling to get on the ladder. I would agree with all the ideas presented in the critiques as well, and think that the revised consensus view is a good response to this question. Revised consensus statement (to be agreed upon by all): The government should do more to help young people struggling to buy a house, although I personally wouldn’t say the government 'needed' to. I would add that it’s not just young people who are being forced out of the housing market, but people of all ages and backgrounds who are struggling to get on the ladder. I would agree with all the ideas presented in the critiques as well, and think that the revised consensus view is a good response to this question.   Summary
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government needs to do more to help young people who are struggling to buy a house. House prices are rising faster than salaries and therefore young people will not be able to afford to buy unless they are in a very fortunate position and their parents are able to help. The government could implement schemes to help people get onto the property ladder. This could include the government gifting money towards the deposit of first time buyers and even paying the interest on their mortgages for a few years, allowing them to build up enough equity in the property to get their own mortgage or loan. The government could also make some changes to stamp duty, such as having a higher threshold and a lower tax rate to save people money. A house building scheme would be much more effective and help a lot more people, but it would also be expensive.
