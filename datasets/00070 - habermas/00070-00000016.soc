# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we do not think that we should require all companies with over 100 employees to publish data on their pay gap between women and men. We believe that there are many reasons why women earn less than men. For example, women are more likely to take time off work to look after children. They are more likely to take a career break etc... As such, the mere fact that a woman earns less than a man is insufficient in determining whether discrimination is taking place. To publish this data would not take the above into consideration and could make a company come across as sexist.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should require all companies with over 100 employees to publish data on their pay gap between women and men but that it is the percentage of the gender pay gap not the amount that they are paid that is the issue. The jury came to the view that publishing actual pay for individuals was a breach of privacy and that it could be misused by competitors for example.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that there should be a requirement for all companies to disclose data on the pay gap between men and women, but only in general terms and not for specific jobs.  It is important to monitor whether inequality exists.  We do not think it should be mandatory to publish individual's salaries.  It is crucial that women are valued in the same way as men, and we think that this data would help towards that goal.
