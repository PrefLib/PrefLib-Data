# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children need daily physical activity in school to be physically healthy. It is important for children to take part in daily physical activity at school in order to be physically healthy. The daily activity can help set good habits for children so that physical activity will become an innate part of their daily life, contributing to their health overall. Children need physical activity at school because it is a crucial part of their development. Parents may be too busy after working all day to ensure their child gets an adequate amount of exercise so schools should provide them the opportunity to move. Sitting and not moving all day is bad for the human body, the children could get restless. Giving them physical activities could make them more likely to be able to pay attention in future classes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Children should have the opportunity to be physically active in school. This is because it is crucial to their development, and also helps to set good habits for later in life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should have the opportunity to be physically active in school. This opinion is backed up by several studies that indicate the benefits of physical activity for children's health. There is a lot of evidence that proves how physical activity can benefit children’s health, however, I also know that a lot of parents don’t have the time to make sure that their child is getting enough exercise. Physical activity in school is good because it gives children the opportunity to be active while also making sure that they are getting a good education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: While it is important for children to be physically active at school, it is vital to understand that every child is different. It is not fair to expect that all children should be able to participate in all physical activities. Children with disabilities should not be excluded from the physical activity they can participate in. Children who are not able to engage in physical activity, perhaps due to lack of ability, should not be made to feel less worthy. If children are unable to engage in physical activity, there are other ways to encourage them to be healthy. School should provide nutritious meals and snacks so that children have access to healthy food.
