# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Capitalism has created a lot of wealth but has also caused a lot of suffering. This is because people have been exploited, and the environment has been damaged. Capitalism needs to be managed better to ensure that it benefits society more and that it is not exploitative and unsustainable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Capitalism has been a key driving force in the development of the modern world and has created a lot of wealth. But the exploitation of workers and the environment has been excessive and needs to be reduced and better managed. A better system would be one that better shares the benefits of capitalism more evenly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The system of global capitalism is in many ways a necessity for society to move forward. The current system, however, does need to be managed better and more carefully so that the benefits are more fairly distributed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Capitalism has been a key driving force in the development of the modern world and has created a lot of wealth. But the exploitation of workers and the environment has been excessive and needs to be reduced and better managed. The benefits of capitalism are needed for society to move forward but the system needs to be managed more carefully to ensure the benefits are shared equally by all.
