# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the consumption of meat. We recognised that there are some issues with the industry, such as animal welfare and the environment, however we believe that these are issues that should be tackled by the industry and government, rather than by individuals.
