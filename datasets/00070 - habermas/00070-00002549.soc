# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think that it is a necessary evil to do this in order to protect law abiding citizens from drunken people and villains. If a person has nothing to hide, they should not have any problems about privacy issues. I even think towns should employ this, as if facial recognition had been around at the time of the Yorkshire Ripper, perhaps he would have been caught sooner.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I personally don't believe its the right thing to do because its an invasion of peoples privacy and big brother that has gone too far.   I understand the technology is there and I appreciate the need for policing cities but where do you stop ?  Do you start using facial recognition outside of cities as well , so that wherever you go there is your face being captured and  you are being tracked wherever you go.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes. The government should use facial recognition in cities. Crime has already gotten out of hand and needs policing. Cameras and facial recognition will act as a deterrent if nothing else. Law enforcement should act on camera footage and not just ignore them.Facial recognition and ID is needed in today's society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I believe that for certain serious crimes such as rape, sexual assault etc or missing children this would be appropriate. However, it is not appropriate for petty crimes or drug related crimes.
