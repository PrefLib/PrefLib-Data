# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Austerity measures can be a good idea if they are paired with initiatives that stimulate the economy.  Austerity can hurt the economy and hinder growth if it is used as a standalone approach.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Austerity is not the best policy in an economic downturn.  Austerity hurts the economy short-term and people have less money to spend as a result.  Public services get cut which cannot be a good thing, especially for those of a lower income.  The way to get out of an economic downturn is to keep cash flowing throughout society.  Spending to create jobs can also work.  However, in some instances, you need to spend money to create money.  If money was spent on social services, people would have more money to spend in shops because they wouldn't need to spend every penny surviving.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While austerity may be a part of a solution to an economic downturn, it should be considered in the context of the prevailing economic conditions.  Under some circumstances, austerity is not appropriate.  For example, if the economy is already operating at or below its potential output, then there is no benefit to imposing austerity.  Additionally, in times of crisis, such as after a natural disaster or other external shock, austerity may not be appropriate.  The key is to judge whether the money spent by the government will result in a larger increase in output than the money spent by private individuals and firms.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Austerity is not the best policy in an economic downturn.  We think that there are other options that are more effective.  The government should invest in creating jobs and in social services.  This would give people more money to spend and would increase the amount of cash flowing throughout society.
