# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK should join the European Free Trade Area as it will allow the UK to have a greater share of the European market. However, the UK should not accept any other conditions from the EU which are not related to trade.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK should join the European Free Trade Area to reduce food prices. High food prices are affecting the whole population. It will also cut costs for import and export businesses. The EFTA would be beneficial for both sides and allow unhindered flow of goods, however, other conditions not necessarily related to trade are likely to be imposed as a mechanism for forcing closer political ties to the EU and these are unacceptable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK should join the European Free Trade Area to reduce food prices and to cut costs for import and export businesses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the decision that the UK should join the European Free Trade Area. We think that it would be beneficial to the UK economy and it would be a good compromise between the deal now implemented and having to be a full-blown member of the EU.
