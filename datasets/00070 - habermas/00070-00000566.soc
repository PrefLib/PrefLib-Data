# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, yes we should implement free early childhood education, for all, because it will help the children and their future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should implement free early childhood education, as it will increase the quality of education for all children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of free early childhood education. However, it was recognised that free early childhood education would be expensive. As a result, the group were in favour of some form of childcare tax relief. The consensus opinion was that free early childhood education is expensive, but necessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that we should implement free early childhood education. We all believe that education should be accessible to all and the more knowledge and experience that children have the better the future of society will be. The initial costs may be expensive but the overall effects will benefit society in the long run. There may be the argument that the current tax system is not sufficient to support this policy, however we believe that with careful use of resources this policy can be achieved.
