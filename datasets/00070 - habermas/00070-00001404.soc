# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the government should use taxes to redistribute wealth. We feel that there is an obscene amount of wealth sitting in bank accounts doing absolutely nothing of value to society beyond making interest to match inflation for it's owner. In many cases, this wealth is earnt via unfair business practices such as having employees earn minimum wage when their labour is worth multiples more. We have so many problems as a society and a country that could be solved by taking those accounts and 'trimming the fat'. We know ourselves as tax payers, we would rather see our money go towards lowering the poverty rate in the uk and evening out the economy,  than it going towards MP's bonuses etc.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We agree that the government should use taxes to redistribute wealth.

In many cases, this wealth is earnt via unfair business practices such as having employees earn minimum wage when their labour is worth multiples more. We have so many problems as a society and a country that could be solved by taking those accounts and 'trimming the fat'. We believe that there would need to be a clear and well thought out taxation plan in place for this to be successful, but we know ourselves as tax payers, we would rather see our money go towards lowering the poverty rate in the uk and evening out the economy,  than it going towards MP's bonuses etc.
