# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the government subsidizing the cost of wind and solar power. This is because it is a renewable energy source and will help reduce the effects of climate change. It is also good for the economy and will create jobs. The group did acknowledge that it will be an expense for the government and that the cost will be passed onto tax payers. The group felt that this will be offset by the benefits of the renewable energy source.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the government should subsidize the cost of wind and solar power. We have a global warming crisis and we need to change to renewable energy sources. The government needs to be at the forefront of funding such energy sources. The individual needs incentive to use wind and solar power. Many cannot afford to switch to these sources and need monetary help. This should come in the form of government subsidies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should subsidize the cost of wind and solar power. The benefits of renewable energy sources are numerous, and the government should be at the forefront of funding such energy sources. Many individuals and companies cannot afford to switch to these sources and need monetary help. This should come in the form of government subsidies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should subsidize the cost of wind and solar power as this will allow us to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels which will in turn help with the global warming situation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
