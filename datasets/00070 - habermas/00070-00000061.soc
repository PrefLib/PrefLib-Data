# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “I believe that the legalisation of cannabis is not such a bad thing. The issue with it is that it is illegal and therefore people who use it are more likely to use harder drugs to try and get away from the effects of cannabis which they have built up a tolerance to. It is also very difficult to come off cannabis as you will always want to go back to it, therefore you need to slowly reduce your use over a long period of time. This is where it can become dangerous as you can increase your usage of the drug over this period, which is how it has become so addictive. If it were legalised there would be a lot more regulations on the amount of cannabis you could purchase, which would hopefully mean that people wouldn't get as addicted and would be able to get off it much easier. This would stop people from using other drugs that are far more dangerous to themselves and other people around them. The legalisation of cannabis would also mean that there would be no crime associated with it, and would therefore mean that the police would be able to focus on other crimes that are far more serious. There would also be a large amount of money that would be added to the economy as it is a huge market
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of legalisation, with one person being strongly against the idea. The general feeling was that legalising cannabis would put money back into the government tax system, as well as saving money on the policing and court costs of prosecuting illegal cannabis users. The drug has also been found to have positive effects on those suffering from a variety of illnesses and by making it legal the government would be able to keep it under control and ensure that it was not abused.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Cannabis should be legalised in the UK. For people who are very ill, suffering from certain illnesses or mental health issues it is used to make them feel better, less stressed and pain free. This is a positive effect. It also makes them feel happier and more productive. By legalising it this will take away the 'underground' market, as well as any organised crime involved in supplying the drug. There are many benefits to legalising cannabis. It can provide a life line for people dealing with an illness as this can be the only product that helps them lead a more normal life pain free.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although cannabis should be legalised in order to allow it to be regulated, the risks are still too high and the harm caused by cannabis is far greater than any possible benefit that could come from its legalisation. In particular, the negative effects of cannabis on health and the risk of mental illness would be too great to allow it to be legalised. Also, it is very likely that cannabis legalisation would increase drug abuse in young people, as young people would be much more likely to experiment with cannabis if it was legal.
