# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Petrol prices should be fair so that people do not feel the need to turn to illegal means to make up the extra cost of living but we should not be reliant on cheap petrol for people to be able to afford to live as this will ultimately lead to increased fuel usage and so more environmental issues. The benefit of Delphi is that there is little time pressure on the participants and the 'debate' can be carried out over a long period of time, which is also beneficial for creating an accurate consensus.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should not subsidise petrol prices as we should not be reliant on cheap petrol for people to be able to afford to live as this will ultimately lead to increased fuel usage and so more environmental issues. The government should however do what they can to keep petrol prices fair so that people do not feel the need to turn to illegal means to make up the extra cost of living.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should not subsidise petrol prices but should ensure that petrol prices are fair and do not force people to turn to illegal means in order to be able to afford to live.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should not subsidise petrol prices. People should not have to rely on cheap petrol in order to live. This would be detrimental to the environment and so the government should not be expected to subsidise petrol in order to keep people's cost of living down.
