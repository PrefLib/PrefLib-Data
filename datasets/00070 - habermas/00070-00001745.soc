# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the UK should be responsible for all of its infrastructure and should not be reliant upon outside sources for such things. It can have a negative effect on the economy, and although it is not always bad, it could become dangerous if it was in the hands of the wrong people. There is always the risk that it could be used to control the UK or could be exploited for money. The benefits of having foreign ownership would be the funding and maybe being able to gain a more diverse knowledge. There is a danger of becoming too reliant on this funding though, and should it be taken away then the country could suffer greatly. Therefore, we should be responsible for our own infrastructure.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Foreign powers should not be allowed to buy UK infrastructure. However, it is not always a bad thing and can provide an influx of funds, but the situation should be carefully assessed first.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Consensus statement reached: The UK should be responsible for all of its infrastructure and should not be reliant upon outside sources for such things.

Part B Participant feedback: I enjoyed coming to university and taking part in a debate in which all people listened to my opinion. it made me feel like my views are being heard by all people of society. If we had more of these events then people would hear from all people and not just those who attend university who voice their opinion. This would in turn may even make more people want to attend university and give them the chance to speak freely about their thoughts I enjoyed having people listen to my opinions and ideas of the question that we were given. I feel that I would like to attend further debates
