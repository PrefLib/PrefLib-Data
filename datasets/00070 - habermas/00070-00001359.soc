# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is clear from the opinions of the group that it is the majority view that we should legalize recreational marijuana. We feel that this is a strong view as we have identified a number of clear benefits. Firstly we believe that the revenue generated would be huge as there are many people that already use it. This money could be put to good use and help to improve the health and wellbeing of our citizens. Secondly we believe that by making this drug legal there would be far less chance of people being arrested for carrying small amounts. In our opinion this will be a big help to many young people as we know that young people will often carry drugs and be arrested which could lead to them being convicted and this will harm their future. It will also free up valuable police time and resources as they will not be spending time chasing people for carrying small amounts of marijuana. Finally we have seen from the USA that this drug has been legalized and they have not suffered any major problems. This is also the case in other countries and as such we feel that it is a strong view that we should also legalize this drug.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is the view of the group that we should legalize recreational marijuana. This is because we think that it will result in many benefits for our country and our citizens. The first major benefit we think is that it will increase tax revenue which could be put to good use in our country. Secondly, we also believe that it would free up our police time and resources as they would not be chasing drug dealers as people could purchase marijuana in shops and pharmacies and it would also not be used or consumed in public places. Finally we have seen in the USA that they have benefited from legalising this drug and we see no reason that the same would not happen here.
