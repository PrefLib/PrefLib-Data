# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of encouraging a greater degree of national pride, but there were some caveats. Firstly, it was felt that this should be done in a way that is not exclusive and that does not lead to division or racism. Secondly, it was felt that it is important to be proud of the good things about the nation, but also to acknowledge the bad things in the nation's history, and to learn from them. It was also felt that it is important to be proud of the nation's achievements, but also to be aware of its failings, and to work to improve them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a greater degree of national pride, although there was some debate over whether this should be encouraged by the government or not. It was felt that the government should not be involved in encouraging pride in the nation, but that it could be encouraged by the people themselves. There was also some debate over whether it was appropriate to encourage pride in the nation's history, with some feeling that this should be done and others feeling that it was not appropriate. In the end, the group decided that it was appropriate to encourage pride in the nation's history, as long as this was done in a way which was not exclusionary. It was also felt that the nation's history should be taught in schools, so that people could learn about the nation's history and be proud of it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of a greater degree of national pride.  We need to feel more confident.  However, this should not be at the expense of other cultures and communities, and we should not forget our history.  The group felt that it is important to remember the past, and to learn from it, but that this should not be at the expense of the future.  The group felt that it is important to celebrate our nation, and to feel proud to be British, but that this should not be at the expense of other nations and communities.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should be doing more to encourage a greater degree of national pride. The British people should be proud of their country, and the way of life we have. We are a very free people, and live in a very free society, and this is something to be proud of. We should be proud of our history, and the fact that we have spread freedom and democracy across the world, and have been the greatest force for good in the world. We should also be proud of our culture, and our achievements, and we should celebrate them. We should also be proud of our military, and the fact that we have been prepared to fight for freedom and democracy across the world, and to fight for the freedom of other nations, and we should be proud of the sacrifices they have made. The British people should be proud to be British, and to live in the greatest country in the world, and to be a part of this great nation.
