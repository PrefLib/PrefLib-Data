# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, they are not doing enough.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government is not doing enough to combat homelessness. They are focusing on the wrong issues and more should be done to help homeless people in this country.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government is not doing enough to combat homelessness. They should be using the money spent on hotels for refugees to provide accommodation for the homeless instead. In order to provide shelter to the homeless, the government should stop their useless bureaucracy and allocate money to build more shelters. By building more shelters and offering more accommodation to the homeless, the government can improve their lives and help them find work and be part of the community
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, they are not. If the government can afford to rent out hotels and apartments for refugees, then they should be doing the same for homeless people.
