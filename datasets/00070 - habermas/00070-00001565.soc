# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The issue of obesity is a very complex one and I think it is very difficult to say whether we are doing enough or not. There is a lot of information out there about healthy eating and exercise and the government is making some efforts to make healthy food more accessible and affordable but there is a long way to go. There is only so much that can be done to help people and in the end it is down to the individual to make the right choices and take responsibility for their own health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We agree that the Government could do more in some areas but ultimately the problem is down to the individual and the choices they make for their own health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It was agreed that the government are doing enough to combat obesity and that obesity is a choice that people have control over. We agreed that this is a huge issue as a lot of obesity leads to people suffering from a range of different health problems such as diabetes and heart problems. We concluded that the government are putting measures in place to tackle the issue of obesity and they are making healthier food options available and that if people want to continue eating unhealthy foods that they should do so at their own risk. It was also agreed that more could be done by the government to tackle the issue of obesity as many people don’t realise the severity of obesity and the consequences that can come with it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We are doing more than enough to combat obesity. This is not a nanny state, If people want to eat too much and not do exercise then they deserve to be fat and ugly.
