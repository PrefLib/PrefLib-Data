# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of making it harder to buy a gun. This was for a number of reasons, including the fact that it is not necessary for most people to own a gun and the fact that it is a very dangerous weapon. However, the group also recognised that in some circumstances, such as farming, it is necessary to own a gun. The group also agreed that there should be regular mental health evaluations for those who own guns, in order to ensure that they are not a danger to themselves or others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that it is important to make it harder to buy a gun. The number of shootings we see in the news on a regular basis is a clear indicator that the level of restrictions on gun ownership is not strict enough. The only people who should be allowed to own guns are those who are farmers or have other reasons to need them for work or practical purposes. Those who wish to own a gun should have a mental health evaluation before they are allowed to do so, and should have regular evaluations after they are allowed to own one.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that there should be a high barrier to entry to owning a gun. This should be more than a mental health evaluation. There should be some sort of course or intensive training session which involves education on why guns should not be used in acts of violence, and that they are meant to be used as a sporting weapon, such as shooting in competitions or for hunting. The below example presents the results of a voting exercise completed by a group of participants in response to a question. Each participant had an equal vote, and the questions was accompanied by three statements which each participant had to choose from. The final result is represented below:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of making it harder to buy a gun. It was agreed that it is not necessary for the average person to own a gun, and that if it is harder to obtain, then the likelihood of it being used for acts of violence will be reduced. It was also agreed that the current system of background checks is not sufficient, and that it should be made more difficult to buy a gun. However, it was also agreed that it is necessary for some people to own a gun, such as farmers, and that the current system should allow for this.
