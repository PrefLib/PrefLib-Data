# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “The price of prescription drugs should be capped. This is because it is important that people are able to afford the drugs that they need. This is especially important for drugs that people need to take on a regular basis. However, it is important to note that the price of drugs is often high because of the cost of research and development, and the cost of production. This means that it is important to find a balance between making drugs affordable and making sure that pharmaceutical companies can still make a profit. This is because if pharmaceutical companies cannot make a profit, then they will not be able to invest in the research and development of new drugs. This would be detrimental to the health of people in the future.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The price of prescription drugs should be capped. This is because the price of prescription drugs is becoming more and more expensive. This means that the people who need them are priced out of being able to afford them. This is especially true for drugs which are needed on a daily basis, such as insulin for diabetic people. If the price of these drugs was capped, then it would mean that people would not be priced out of being able to afford the drugs that they need. However, the price of prescription drugs is dependent on the supply and demand of said drugs and the price of some drugs may fluctuate more than others. Therefore, the price of some drugs may need to be capped more than others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The price of prescription drugs should be capped. There are many people who rely on prescription drugs to keep themselves alive, and they should not be priced out of the drugs that they need. This is especially true for people with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes. There are many people who cannot afford to buy insulin, and this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. The price of prescription drugs is getting more and more expensive, and the price needs to be capped to make sure that everyone can afford the drugs that they need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the price of prescription drugs should be capped, as many people rely on them for their welfare and they are becoming increasingly unaffordable. However, there are some drugs which are very expensive to produce and which may require a very high price to make a profit from. Therefore, the price of these drugs should not be capped, but the price of other drugs should be capped to make them more affordable for people who rely on them.
