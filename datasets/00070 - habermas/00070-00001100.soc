# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should encourage the use of electric cars by offering tax breaks to their owners, in order to reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality, and promote the use of green technology. However, tax breaks should have a fixed duration, for example 2 - 3 years, and also, government needs to invest in the infrastructure for electric cars such as charging ports to make sure the increasing amount of vehicles can be handled.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final consensus statement: The government should encourage the use of electric cars by offering tax breaks to their owners. This would be an incentive for people to want to purchase a vehicle that is safer for the environment. The government would also need to make investments in the infrastructure for electric cars such as charging ports to make sure the increasing amount of vehicles can be handled. The tax breaks should have a fixed duration, for example 2 - 3 years, so that the government wouldn't lose too much tax income, or else this would affect the budget in other public services. This should be assessed at the end of the tax break period to decide whether there should be a further round of tax breaks.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should encourage the use of electric cars by offering tax breaks to their owners. This would be an incentive for people to want to purchase a vehicle that is safer for the environment. The government would also need to make investments in the infrastructure for electric cars such as charging ports to make sure the increasing amount of vehicles can be handled. The tax breaks should have a fixed duration, for example 2 - 3 years, so that the government wouldn't lose too much tax income, or else this would affect the budget in other public services. The tax breaks should be reviewed after 3 years to gauge the success.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should encourage the use of electric cars by offering tax breaks to their owners. This would be an incentive for people to want to purchase a vehicle that is safer for the environment. The government would also need to make investments in the infrastructure for electric cars such as charging ports to make sure the increasing amount of vehicles can be handled. The tax breaks should have a fixed duration, for example 2 - 3 years, so that the government wouldn't lose too much tax income, or else this would affect the budget in other public services. This would also allow the government to gauge the success of the tax breaks after a couple of years and allow them to make any necessary changes.
