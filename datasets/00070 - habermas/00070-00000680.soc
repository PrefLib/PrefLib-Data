# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the public sector pension should be based on a career average, however in certain cases it should be based on final salary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have come to the conclusion that the public sector pension should be based on a final salary. We feel that people have worked their entire lives to enjoy the best retiement possible and this will be maximised with a pension based on their final salary. People should be rewarded in retirement for their lifetime of hardwork.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: A career average is fairer as it reflects the total career of the individual, rather than just their final salary. A career average is also a fairer reflection of the contribution that an individual has made to the public sector over their entire career.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The public sector pension should be based on a career average as this is fairer to all who work in the public sector. The people who work in the public sector do so for the benefit of the public and should be rewarded for their hard work and commitment. It also allows for people to work their way up through the sector, to reap the rewards of their hard work.
