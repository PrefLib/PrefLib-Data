# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children should be taught about sex and the implications of sexual activity. If a parent is not comfortable with this, they should be allowed to opt out. However, this should be allowed only if there is a very strong, valid reason for that.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While it is important for children to be taught about sexual health and their sexual rights, we also need to recognise that some parents may not feel comfortable with the information that may be presented in sex education classes. Therefore, we agree that parents should be able to opt out of sex education classes for their children. However, we also believe that sex education is an important part of a child’s development. If parents opt out, they should be required to undertake their own sex education with their child, and we should ensure that children receive a minimum standard of sex education from their parents. We would also recommend that other parents are not allowed to opt out of sex education classes, to prevent any one child being disadvantaged or discriminated against.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although sex education is important for a child's development, we feel that the opinions of parents should not be ignored, and if they feel their child is better off being taught at home, they should be able to opt out. However, it should be noted that in some cases, a parent opting out of sex education classes for their child could be putting them at risk in terms of their sexual health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children should not be allowed to opt out of sex education classes. Sex education is an important part of a child’s development and it is necessary to prepare them for the future. The group felt that parents should not be allowed to withhold this information from their children, even if it runs counter to their religious beliefs. The group felt that it is important to prepare children for the future, and if they are not prepared for the implications of sex, they may make poor choices that could have a detrimental effect on their lives. The group felt that it is the responsibility of the school to provide children with the best possible education, and this includes sex education. If a parent does not want their child to attend sex education classes, then they should not send their child to that school. The group felt that this is the only way to ensure that children receive the best possible education, and that this is the responsibility of the school.
