# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There are several major  problem with the term carbon. It it really possible for carbon emission to reach a zero level? or are they "net through  not just futuristic offsets, which are expensive or unproven. at scale. I think the UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050. There needs to be a point where everyone is forced to make the changes that are needed to stop producing carbon for the health of the planet. Although it is difficult to see how this will be possible at times there have been advances in this field and people and organisations who are more vocal about changes for the future. I think the problem can seem insurmountable and people struggle to see what they can do to make a different but if there were more stringent timelines in place maybe it would be more achievable. Measures to reduce CO2 are important however all. Electric are definitetlyNOT the answer. Several companies are directing their R and D to hydrogen. They should be encouraged. We shouldn't set a goal for carbon neutral by 2050, because it should be far sooner than that.  Climate change is happening at a terribly accelerating rate, any delay will only cause further problems down the road.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although there are many arguments for and against setting a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050, it is the opinion of this group that the UK should set this goal. The UK is one of the largest producers of carbon in the world, and as such it is our responsibility to lead the way in making changes to reduce our carbon emissions. The date of 2050 is ambitious, but necessary to ensure that we make the changes needed to reduce our carbon emissions. The longer we wait, the more difficult it will be to make the necessary changes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of setting a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050, but with some reservations. The reservations were mainly around whether it is feasible to reach this goal, and whether it is the right thing to do. There was some concern that this would lead to a large increase in the cost of living for the average person, and that this would lead to a reduction in the quality of life. It was also felt that there is a lack of understanding of the term carbon neutral, and that this could lead to people feeling that they are not making a difference, when in fact they are.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050.  This is a long-term goal, and the UK will need to work hard to achieve this.  The UK should set interim goals, to ensure that it is on track to achieve this long-term goal.  The UK should also work with other countries to achieve this goal.  It is important to work with other countries, to ensure that the UK is not disadvantaged by the actions of other countries.  It is also important to work with other countries, to ensure that the actions of the UK are not disadvantaged by the actions of other countries.  The UK should also set a goal to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero by 2035.  This is a more challenging goal, and the UK will need to work hard to achieve this.
