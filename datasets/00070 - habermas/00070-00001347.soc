# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a minimum wage that all people should be paid, and this should be reviewed regularly.  There should be a maximum wage that all people should be paid, and this should be reviewed regularly.  Pay should be based on the role and not on the person.  If a person is not performing to the required level in their role, they should be given the opportunity to improve.  If they do not improve, they should be given the opportunity to find another role.  If they cannot find another role, they should be made redundant.  There should be no discrimination in pay based on any factor other than the role and the person's performance in that role.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be no difference in pay for doing the same job.  This is the case in most organisations, however there are some organisations that still pay different rates for the same job.  This is very wrong and can cause a lot of problems in the workplace.  This can lead to discrimination and can lead to employees leaving the organisation.  It can also lead to a very hostile working environment which is not good for anyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Paying people different wages for doing the same work is not necessarily wrong. However, there must be no discrimination based on factors such as sex, race or religion. Employees must be paid based on their performance, experience, skill set and productivity. Paying people based on different skills sets, qualifications, experience, productivity and performance will motivate others to increase their productivity and skills set in order to obtain better wages. However, no employee should be paid less than the minimum wage, this can lead to discontent and increase employee turnover, which increases costs for the business.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While the concept of paying different wages for the same work can appear to be fair if a person who is better at their job is paid more, it can lead to direct discrimination based on other factors such as sex, race or religion. It can also create discourse among colleagues and a hostile working environment, which in turn increases employee turnover and increased costs for the business. Overall, we believe people should be paid broadly the same for the same work. However variances can occur where people may have different skill sets and/or qualifications, or through performance in the role. Therefore, we believe that pay 'bands' can accommodate these differences in that people are paid at roughly the same level but there is scope within a pay band to vary pay where necessary or appropriate. There would never be differences in pay based on age, creed, colour or sex.
