# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While it is an important and noble cause, we do not believe that all companies should be forced to make a yearly donation to charity. It should be an individual choice and that choice should not be taken away by the government. Charity should not be something that is forced upon anyone, and the government would not know which charities to make companies donate to, or if they would even donate to a good cause, so it would be unfair to force companies to donate if the government could not guarantee that this money would be used well. We also believe that the government has no right to take away the money of a company that has been working hard all year just to give it to a charity that may not even be relevant to the company or the community that they work in. There is no good way of making a charity system that works for everyone, and to implement this would be unfair to some.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we do not think that all companies in the UK should be required to make a yearly donation to charity. The issue of charity giving is very contentious, and the idea of forcing companies to give to charity would be very divisive. There are also many issues with this idea, such as the fact that it would be unfair to smaller companies that are just starting out. We believe that charity giving should be a voluntary choice, and as a society we should not expect anyone to make any donations. Charities are created for charitable purposes and all donations to them should be the person's or company's own choice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, companies should not be required to make a yearly donation to charity. This is because charities are created for charitable purposes and all donations to them should be the person's or company's own choice. It would also be wrong to force companies to make a yearly donation to charity because it would be an infringement on their freedom to choose.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No. It would be unfair on smaller companies who are just starting out. This will only make the cost of living in the UK rise and will ultimately lead to increased poverty and higher unemployment. The UK is already the second most generous country in the world, after the US, and this would reduce the money that would otherwise be going to charities.
