# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that we do not think that it is a good idea to allow employees to give their holidays to colleagues. There is the potential for abuse of the system, for example, a manager could use their position of power to pressure employees into giving up their holidays. This could lead to employees feeling that they have no choice but to give up their holidays.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We are in favour of allowing an employee to give their annual holiday entitlement to colleagues, but would like to propose a limit of how many days one employee can take.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We have come to the decision that employees should be allowed to give their holiday days to colleagues. However, we believe that the number of days that can be gifted should be limited to ensure fairness and also to avoid disruption to the business. The limit should be set at 2 days per employee. This would mean that employees could still give their holiday days to a colleague but not to the extent that it would be unfair or cause a problem to the business.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a set limit of holiday days that can be donated and an employee should be allowed to take a maximum of the number of holiday days their employer has agreed to provide. The participant donating the holiday days should receive adequate compensation for the amount of days they are donating. Conclusion After seeing the above examples, I believe that my research question has been fully answered. It is clear that employees should have a set number of holidays that they are entitled to, which can be determined by the organisation that employs them. I believe that it is right that the employer should have some say in how the holidays are taken, but the employee should also be able to use their holiday days as they wish. It is also clear that as the research participants' consensus view demonstrates, employees should be given the opportunity to donate any holidays that they do not plan on using to colleagues. This gives them a choice and allows them to give something back to their employer. I believe that any holidays given to colleagues should be rewarded with some form of compensation and should be of a limited number, to avoid employees accumulating an endless amount of holidays.
