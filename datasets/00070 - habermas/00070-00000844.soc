# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Climate change is real and needs to be fought against. It is a threat to humanity. However, it is not something that can be solved by Britain alone. It is something that needs to be tackled by all nations. It needs to be tackled by big organisations as well as by individuals. We need to be careful that we don't allow the fight against climate change to be used as a way to implement more restrictions and control over the public. We need to ensure that the fight against climate change is not something that is used to make money or to implement a political agenda. We need to be careful that the fight against climate change is not used as an excuse to implement policies that hurt people financially.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Climate change is a very real threat to the future of humanity and so we should be doing all we can to reduce our carbon footprint. We should be looking at all aspects of our lives, from the food we eat to the way we travel and how we heat our homes. It is also important that we work with other countries to help them reduce their carbon footprint as well.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “Yes, Britain should go on fighting climate change by reducing our carbon footprint. The evidence is clear that climate change is happening and that human activity is causing it. As such, we all have a responsibility to try and mitigate the effects of climate change. This can be done by reducing our carbon footprint. We should all be looking to reduce the amount of energy we use and switching to more renewable sources of energy. We should also be looking to reduce our consumption of goods and food that require a lot of energy to produce. However, we should not be looking to reduce our carbon footprint at the expense of our freedom or financial well-being.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Climate change is a very real threat to the future of humanity and the world as we know it. In the fight against climate change, Britain has a responsibility to do its part, as well as encouraging other nations to do the same. There are benefits to reducing our carbon footprint and fighting climate change, such as reducing the risk of flooding and extreme weather conditions, as well as creating jobs and opportunities in green industries. However, there are also costs, such as the impact on the economy, particularly for people in lower socioeconomic groups. There is also the issue of fairness, as the UK is only responsible for a small amount of the world’s carbon emissions, so it is unfair that we should be expected to make all the changes. Therefore, the UK should fight climate change, but we must also be realistic about what we can achieve and ensure that the benefits of fighting climate change outweigh the costs.”
