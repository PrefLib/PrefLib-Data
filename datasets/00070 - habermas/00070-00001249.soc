# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A basic income scheme would be beneficial to the economy. It would ensure that everyone has enough income to survive and reduce the number of people living in poverty. This would reduce the burden of the masses on the government and improve the general well-being of the population. However, there are challenges to introducing a basic income scheme. For example, the line would have to be drawn somewhere, and some people would be more in need of a basic income than others. Also, there would be a cost to the government to introduce a basic income scheme. This cost would have to be paid for somehow, and this could be through tax. This could mean that people who are already struggling financially would be paying more tax to support a basic income scheme, which could make their situation worse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: A basic income scheme would be a great idea if it was affordable. It would help alleviate poverty and give a basic quality of life to everyone. It would make people happier and healthier, however there are many things to consider when implementing it. - Where would the money come from? - How would the payments be distributed? - What would be the rate of pay? - How would the rate of pay differ from people in different countries? - How much would the payments be taxed? - How would this be monitored? - What if someone abuses the system? - How would this be monitored?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: A basic income scheme is a good idea and should be considered for implementation. This is because it will reduce poverty and improve the general well-being of the population. However, it is not a straightforward answer and many of the goals achieved from a basic income scheme could be achieved through changes in the existing social system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that basic income is the best option to fight poverty and income inequality. In fact, it is one of the most cost-effective methods to do so, particularly as compared to the current welfare system. The consensus is also that a basic income would allow for a more diverse and creative workforce as there is more security in taking risks and trying new things. The risk of destitution is lowered, which would encourage individuals to look for more fulfilling and creative roles. However, we do not think that basic income is a perfect solution. The consensus is that a basic income would provide a universal basic income, which is better than nothing. However, it would be much better to focus the basic income scheme on those most in need of it. This would help the poorest people in society the most. However, this raises problems, such as how to define the people in need and how much income they need. The consensus is that we would recommend a basic income scheme in the future.
