# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The minimum wage should increase to counter the inflation of just basic necessities like bread, milk and fruit & veg. There's many people working multiple jobs just to put a roof over their head and eat poorly and unless things change drastically I don't see how it will improve. We need a better infrastructure and a limit to how much we can charge for basic needs  whilst increasing the minimum wage by the same percentage the inflation has.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I believe the Minimum wage should increase. With the raise in inflation and cost of living crisis, we should be trying to align everyone to be able to survive this period of time. If we do not, this could have a more negative impact on the economy as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes minimum wage should be raised. The cost of living has affected everyone with the most affected being the worse off members of society, increasing the minimum wage would help to assist people in troubling times. Without increasing minimum wage how are we expecting people on minimum wage to keep up with inflation rises etc.? 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The minimum wage should be raised to a level that aligns with the current higher cost of living. The price of food, energy, and rent has increased drastically over the past few years, in part because of Brexit, and those on minimum wage are suffering because of it. We need to empower those in low-wage jobs, instead of punishing them, and that empowerment looks like fair financial compensation. We need to help bring people up over the poverty line. To leave the minimum wage where it is, is cruel.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: No, the minimum wage should not be raised. Employers should be free to set whatever wage level they deem appropriate. If the employee doesn't like the wage they are offered, and think they can get more elsewhere, then they are free to leave. A minimum wage that continues to rise is incredibly inflationary - it increases the cost of doing business which results in higher prices for all, which in turn reduces the benefit of a minimum wage increase.
