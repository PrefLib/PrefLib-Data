# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, we should raise the minimum wage in the UK. It is important that the minimum wage reflects the cost of living. Employing someone for less than they can live on is wrong. Firms making increased profits should have to increase pay to reflect this success and share some of the rewards with those that actually create the profit through their work and, not as is common nowadays, just reward the shareholders who, really, make no contribution to the firms success. The increase in the minimum wage would go some way to remving that barrier, boosting employment figures, increasing morale and putting less reliance on benefits. Most of the jobs  at the lower end of the wage scale are menial and in service industries  where hard work brings little reward. There is also a risk that a person on the current minium wage is exploited ny an employer. Placing the onus on that employer to pay a minimum wage that is higher would weed out rogue employers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should raise the minimum wage in the UK. We should do this to ensure that those people who are prepared to work are not disadvantaged by low wages and a low standard of living. The increase should reflect the cost of living and the need for employees to be able to afford to live and save for the future. The increase should be phased in to allow employers to adjust their business models to accommodate the increase. The increase should also be used to reduce the reliance on benefits and incentivise people to work. We should also use the increase to remove rogue employers who exploit employees by paying them a wage that is below the minimum wage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The minimum wage should be increased to ensure that it reflects the cost of living and also reflects the contribution that lower paid workers make to the economy. This will help to ensure that people are not exploited by employers and will also help to reduce the reliance on state benefits by people who are able and willing to work. This will help to increase employment and also help to reduce the benefits bill, which is currently unsustainable. However, it should be noted that there is a risk that if the minimum wage is raised, then this will lead to other wages being increased by a similar percentage. This could lead to inflation and also lead to other problems within the economy. It is therefore important to ensure that any increase in the minimum wage is carefully considered and that the impact on the economy is fully understood before any increase is implemented.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should raise the minimum wage in the UK. There are many people that wish to work but the financial incentive is not there because the wages are too low. Even when supplemented by state benefits, there is still a  lack of incentive due to the fringe advantages of staying within the benefit system. The increase in the minimum wage would go some way to remving that barrier, boosting employment figures, increasing morale and putting less reliance on benefits. Most of the jobs  at the lower end of the wage scale are menial and in service industries  where hard work brings little reward. There is also a risk that a person on the current minium wage is exploited ny an employer. Placing the onus on that employer to pay a minimum wage that is higher would weed out rogue employers. The basic wage must be able to pay for the basic cost of living plus leave something extra to pay for a reasonable lifestyle and  enough to save for the future.
