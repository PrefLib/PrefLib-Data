# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: We should ban the use of non-biodegradable plastic. Plastic pollution threatens food safety and quality, human health, marine life, coastal tourism and contributes to climate change, and so the use of non-biodegradable plastic is damaging where it is disposed of without regulation. Non-biodegradable plastic should therefore be banned in disposable goods, while we implement schemes to give financial support for companies to recycle or to switch to viable alternatives. How will you get participants to give ‘good’ quality input?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a ban on the use of non-biodegradable plastic. It should be replaced with biodegradable alternatives, and the costs of this transition should be shared between government, industry and consumers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should ban the use of non-biodegradable plastic for most applications, and move towards using alternatives. This will limit the pollution to our oceans and other aquatic ecosystems where most of it ends up, since it takes many years to breakdown and by that time will have dispersed. Non-biodegradable plastic cannot be broken down to its original constituents by natural methods, but must instead undergo chemical change, and so we should ban it where it is commonly disposed of without regulation. We could still use non-biodegradable plastics, but in recycable forms or schemes, where disposal is also regulated. However, this is not enough and we should ban the use of non-biodegradable plastic in disposable goods, and provide financial support or incentives for companies to switch to viable alternatives.
