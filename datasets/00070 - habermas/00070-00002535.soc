# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is no reason for single use plastics other than convenience, and the environmental cost of not just disposing of these products but also their creation and recycling as high. We should only be using plastic, an oil-derived product, for necessary items such as medical devices, engineering etc. If an alternative can be used, it should be. Single-use disposable plastics are an abominable waste, andlead to the build-up of microplastics in the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - unnecessary single use plastic items should definitely be restricted in some way but I'm not sure they should be totally banned. i think it would be better to try and reduce use rather than banning them completely
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should. Single-use plastics are destroying the oceans and ocean life. Animals are suffering because of the actions of humans. There are things that we as humans do need, single-use plastics are not one of them. Yes they may be useful for certain things, but they are not more important than the lives of animals
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I agree we should ban them in the interest of the environment and wildlife however we need to find a suitable alternative.  Currently I have not come across a satisfactory alternative the papers straws do not serve their purpose for any length of time and metal ones are nasty to use 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - Yes I think that single-use plastics should be banned as they are wasteful. I feel this is important to me as I care about the planet and most importantly I worry about the impact on animals. I do think some things like plastic straws are useful but there are alternatives. I would choose something more sustainable that a single-use plastic if I could.
