# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: This seems fair in theory and I do agree footballers and many other people are incredibly overpaid. However I don't think it's as black and white as saying they shouldn't earn more than the Prime Minister - the skills and industries are very different - what makes the Prime Minister's salary the anchor of all wages? I think there needs to be better pay equality within the industry itself - so the wealth within the football clubs is distributed more evenly to all of the team members - from cleaners, head office, customer service and people serving drinks in the stadium. It should all be relative to the highest earner within the industry.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I don't think it is important to have a maximum wage to ensure that footballers do not earn more than the Prime Minister. Whilst I think that footballers are paid a considerable, and arguably too high amount, I do not see why it would be capped against the wage of the PM. Whilst the PM works hard, so do footballers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, I don't believe this would be a good idea. There are three reasons for this. 1) Footballers have a limited time when they have the physical capability of performing so they will need to maximise their income during this shorter time. Prime Ministers do a stressful but sedentary work and they have very good post PM benefits. 2) Footballers generate more economic value when they are operating at the highest levels by bringing in ticket sales, something that a PM does not and 3) Footballers are in the entertainment business and therefore do not have any specific term of office thereby adding risk and volatility to their income, something PMs do not have to worry about. Therefore, there should not be a maximum wage cap for footballers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I believe if there a limit people and businesses will find way to get non-salary methods to get paid more by sponsorships or benifits like shares in a company as payment for example.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Wages represent how much someone's skill is valued and in current society there is too much emphasis of sports and other high paying jobs without respecting the other jobs like teachers, police, health care workers.  Public sector workers don't get the high wages of private companies, e.g. football companies, and it is inherently unfair.  I agree with having a cap on wages so that the wealth in the country is more evenly distributed, and according to skill.
