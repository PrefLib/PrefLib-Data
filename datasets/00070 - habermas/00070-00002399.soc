# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children under 13 should not be allowed to use social media. Whilst we can see the appeal to children, it is not appropriate for them to have access to the same information as adults. Children of this age do not have the necessary knowledge and information to make informed decisions about what they are viewing. Children are also in danger of speaking to people they don't know and can be easily influenced by the content they see. Not to mention the risk of cyber bullying and grooming. Children are in danger of being exposed to harmful content and it is difficult to control what they see.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to use social media. Whilst social media can be used in a positive way, the content and interactions that can occur are not suitable for children of this age. Children are not yet mature enough to handle the negative impacts that can occur from social media usage. The content that can be viewed can be harmful and inappropriate for younger viewers. The risk of children being exposed to harmful content and interactions is too great and can have a negative impact on their mental well being and perceptions of the world. The issue of online safety is also a concern and children are not yet clued up on how to stay safe online. Social media is difficult to control with the content children are exposed to and have access to. Children of this age also do not need to be influenced by adults and don't understand certain nuances. Children are in danger of speaking to people they don't know. Social media can be a force for good, when used in a social manner but it can equally be used to undermine the vulnerable. The group of participants believe that children under 13 should not be allowed to use social media.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to use social media. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the content that can be viewed on these sites/apps can be harmful and inappropriate for younger viewers. Once children have access, it is very difficult to control what they see. Whilst some children may be mature enough to view the content, the vast majority will not be. It could negatively affect their mental well being and perceptions of the world. Secondly, children are very impressionable. They can be easily influenced by what they see online. They may be targeted by online groomers who may seek to exploit them. Children are also very susceptible to cyberbullying. Thirdly, there is a risk that children may be exposed to adult content. This can be very damaging to their innocence. Finally, there is a risk that children may be exposed to violent and harmful content. This can lead to them acting out in a violent manner.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to use social media. Social media can be a very dangerous place, with many people posting inappropriate content, and with many people being able to contact your child, it is very difficult to monitor and control what your child is exposed to. There is also the risk of cyber bullying, which can be very harmful to a child's mental health. It is also very difficult to control the amount of time a child spends on social media, and this can have a negative impact on their school work and social life.
