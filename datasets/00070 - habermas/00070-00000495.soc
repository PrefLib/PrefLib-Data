# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should introduce a universal basic income, but it should only be offered to those who cannot work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe the introduction of Universal Basic Income would be good for society. It would help alleviate the stress that many families face when trying to balance their finances and would help people in need get back on their feet. However, we believe that some people would take advantage of the system, and that a means test should be carried out to prevent this from happening.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People on very low incomes should receive a basic income from the government that is sufficient to live off. However, this is not an excuse for them to sit at home doing nothing. Instead, they must look for employment and be prepared to take any job they are offered. They must also be prepared to undergo training to help improve their chances of finding work. If they refuse to follow these simple requirements, then their income will be reduced to a level that is just enough to live on and provide food and shelter. They will also be monitored to ensure that they are not engaging in criminal activities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Income is something that people earn for working. It's hard to see how people can work if they are already given an income. There's a lot of evidence that shows that if people aren't working, they will go into debt, they will spend more money than they have.
