# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government of the UK should require businesses to publish diversity data. This is because it would be good to see who the diverse employers are in that they are offering employment to people regardless of sexuality, race, disability etc. It is important for businesses operating in the UK to be clear and transparent regarding their employees. It is helpful for reporting and analysing trends also. It would help the general public to be more informed about the company's diversity policies. Companies would also be held accountable for any possible biases in hiring. Underrepresented minorities would have slightly better chances of getting hired if all companies were transparent.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK government should require all businesses to publish diversity data. This is to ensure that minorities have the opportunity to seek employment without facing any forms of discrimination. With a diverse workforce, companies can benefit from various perspectives and inputs, enhancing innovation and business opportunities. In the long run, this would bring the UK in line with many other countries such as the US and Australia, both of which already have established legislations in place.
