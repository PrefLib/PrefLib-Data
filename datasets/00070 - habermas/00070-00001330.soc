# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although theoretically the government should provide funding for high-speed rail lines between cities, this particular example would not be the best use of available funds. Money would be better spent in other areas such as childcare, education and other social necessities. Additionally, if money were to be available for infrastructure projects such as these, it would be better spent improving existing lines so they run to time and provide a reliable service. The participants had considered the potential benefit of such a project but concluded that in this instance, it would not be appropriate. They also considered that people would rather have their taxes spent on education and social services rather than transport. They acknowledged that transport is important but felt that improvements to existing services would be better than this specific project. Conclusion The question asked the group to form a consensus view on whether the government should provide funding for high-speed rail links. This is a very controversial topic, and it was expected that there would be a wide range of views and beliefs. Interestingly, the group came to the view that whilst such funding is desirable, in this particular instance it would not be the best use of available funds. They also came to the view that tax-payers would rather see their taxes spent on
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of high-speed rail lines between major cities. The group felt that it was important to ensure that the rail infrastructure was fit for purpose and that the government should look to improve existing lines before looking at new ones. The group felt that the government should not look to fund projects such as HS2, but should look at smaller scale projects which would provide more benefit to more people. The group also felt that the government should look to invest in improving transport links to smaller towns and cities, rather than just focusing on the major cities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of funding for high-speed rail projects. However, as participant 3 said, there needs to be strict oversight of projects of this scale, and they need to be handled in an effective and efficient way. This is especially important in the current economic climate where funding for projects such as these will be coming out of public money.  Additionally, we need to think about how we are spending our money and what are the benefits. For example, it is easy to focus on the benefits of high-speed rail to business and tourism but it is also important to consider how this might be better spent on things such as infrastructure, health and education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the government should provide funding for high-speed rail lines between major cities. However, in the current economic climate, this is not a priority and the government should focus on other areas of spending.
