# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Marriage is a very personal decision and therefore the government should not try to promote it. There are many other things that the government should be spending its time and money on.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the government promoting marriage. It was felt that the institution of marriage has a positive impact on society and promotes family values. Marriage has the ability to provide stability for individuals, for families, for children. In a society that is increasingly transient this is beneficial, noting of course that it is not for everyone. However, some people shy away from it due to cost and pressures surrounding it. Promoting marriage as a simple procedure with minimal cost and effort would therefore probably be beneficial for society. In terms of society marriage also has financial implications again for the individual, families and children. Unpacking those or indeed increasing them as an incentive to create cohesive family units might be beneficial to society as a whole. Perhaps linked to a time period that you must be married for some of these to be unlocked.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of the government promoting marriage, but not to the extent that it would force people into marriage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should not try to promote marriage.
