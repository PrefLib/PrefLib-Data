# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the growing use of robots to perform jobs should not be cause for concern. However, where job losses occur, then steps should be taken to support those people who are losing their jobs as a result of the increased use of robots and AI.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, yes we should be concerned that many jobs are now being performed by robots, as it is likely to lead to an increase in unemployment. This will further cause a widening of the wealth gap and poverty levels as well as creating many societal problems and causing many people to become unhappy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although there is a lot of potential for robots to make a significant contribution to the future of human society, and the rapid advancement in the development of AI is encouraging, there are still a lot of questions and risks involved. Therefore, it would be prudent to proceed with caution, and address some of the potential problems first, such as employment levels.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should be concerned that robots are taking on many jobs as this can lead to wide spread unemployment.
