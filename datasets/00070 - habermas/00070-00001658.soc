# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In principle the idea of having a single currency is a good idea as it removes barriers to trade. However, in practice it has not worked well. The Euro was set up as a single currency for a group of countries with very different economies and this has led to some countries doing well and others badly. In addition, it is not clear that it is in the interests of the UK to replace the pound with the Euro. The pound is a strong currency and the UK has the ability to set interest rates that suit its own economy. It is not clear that it would be in the interests of the UK to replace the pound with the Euro. However, if the UK were to rejoin the EU it would be sensible to look at the pros and cons of having a single currency. Bret Grybus: This was the final consensus view of the group of participants. It brings together a number of different opinions while clearly highlighting what participants did and did not agree. Peter Serotkin: I disagree with the conclusion that the euro has not worked well. Bret Grybus: Thanks Peter for that. Let's see what others think?
