# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The government should create an 'opt-out' system of organ donation. This would massively increase the amount of organs available for donation, reducing wait times for life saving operations, and potential save the lives of millions. Additionally, there may be some comfort to families of the deceased donor, that whilst they are gone, their organs have gone on to help someone else live their life. Creating an "opt-out" system would give hope to thousands who are waiting for organs, and prevent thousands of organs going to waste after we pass away. We must stress that opting out is always an option and encourage all those who are eligible to register for the NHS Organ Donor Register, ensuring their wishes are carried out and their legacy is made clear.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should create an 'opt-out' system of organ donation. This would massively increase the amount of organs available for donation, reducing wait times for life saving operations, and potential save the lives of millions.

Creating an "opt-out" system would give hope to thousands who are waiting for organs, and prevent thousands of organs going to waste after we pass away. The "opt-out" system is not compulsory and should only apply if you have not expressly opted out of the scheme. This was seen as a way of preserving a respect for each individual's rights, whilst providing a way to help those on the wait-list.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should create an 'opt-out' system of organ donation. This would massively increase the amount of organs available for donation, reducing wait times for life saving operations, and potential save the lives of millions. Additionally, there may be some comfort to families of the deceased donor, that whilst they are gone, their organs have gone on to help someone else live their life. Creating an "opt-out" system would give hope to thousands who are waiting for organs, and prevent thousands of organs going to waste after we pass away. This would be an incredibly beneficial decision for everyone in the country. However, we would also like to reiterate that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. An opt-out system would simply mean that organs are donated unless the donor has expressed otherwise during their lifetime, with a ‘soft opt-out’ model still providing for this decision to be overturned by relatives after death. Those who disagree with organ donation would have to actively ‘opt-out’, rather than doing nothing and therefore ‘opting-in’ to donation under a current opt-in system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should create an 'opt-out' system of organ donation. This would massively increase the amount of organs available for donation, reducing wait times for life saving operations, and potential save the lives of millions. Additionally, there may be some comfort to families of the deceased donor, that whilst they are gone, their organs have gone on to help someone else live their life. Creating an "opt-out" system would give hope to thousands who are waiting for organs, and prevent thousands of organs going to waste after we pass away. Although it would be illegal to harvest someone's organs without their consent, all citizens will have to make a conscious decision to opt out. No one will be forced to donate and they will be given ample opportunity to do so. They must contact the government and register that they do not want to donate their organs.
