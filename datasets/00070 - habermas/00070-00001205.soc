# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the government should require people to do jury service. This is to ensure that the legal system is fair and impartial. However, the government should be understanding and lenient when someone has a reasonable excuse not to do it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It was thought that the government should require people to do jury service to ensure a broad representation of people can sit on the jury. This allows the justice system to run smoothly as jury members are impartial and can make a fair and unbiased decision on the case they are sitting on. The jury must make the correct verdict and must not be influenced by a judge or anyone else. However, some people may not want to do jury service as it could have a big impact on their lives, for example, people who are the main carer for someone or someone who is a single parent may not want to take the time out of their lives to do jury service. It is also important that jurors do not discuss their case with anyone else so this could mean that the juror would have to take a significant amount of time off from their job or even quit their job. In conclusion, the government should require people to do jury service to ensure the justice system runs smoothly and all jury members are impartial and unbiased.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should require you to do jury service. This is because the jury system is the best way to ensure a fair and impartial legal system. It is the best way to ensure that all people are treated equally under the law, and that the legal system is not biased in any way. The government should require you to do jury service, but should be understanding and lenient when someone has a reasonable excuse not to do it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group came to the consensus view that the government should require people to do jury service because it will allow the court to hear and view an unbiased jury opinion. The government may sometimes need to be lenient to those with valid excuses.
