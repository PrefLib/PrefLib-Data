# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People in the UK should be allowed to sue the government if they have been wrongfully convicted. The system of the law in this country is an important part of the fabric of society, so if there is a wrongful conviction, whether it be down to poor policing and evidence gathering, or poor selection of a jury or a judge, the individual who has been wrongfully convicted should be able to be compensated for any losses or damage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People in the UK should be allowed to sue the government if they have been wrongfully convicted, unless they are clearly guilty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should be sued by wrongfully convicted people as the government is responsible for fairly and lawfully convicting wrongdoing. Mistakes do happen and it would be unjust if wrongful convictions didn't allow for compensation. It is the responsibility of the government to fairly and lawfully convict and if they get this wrong the individual should be compensated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, people in the UK should be allowed to sue the government if they have been wrongfully convicted. A wrongful conviction can have life changing effects on a person and, depending on the severity of the sentence, they can be made to pay a heavy price. It is only right that the government is held responsible for such a miscarriage of justice.
