# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, free childcare is a good thing, but it is important to consider how it is provided and for which age groups. We feel that it is important to offer support to parents in the form of parental leave, and that this should be available to both parents. In addition, we feel that free childcare should be provided from a young age, and that it should be provided in a way that supports children's development and learning, and not just as a childminding service. However, we do not feel that free childcare should be provided from birth, as we feel that it is important for babies to have a consistent primary caregiver in their early months. For this reason, we would support the government providing universal paid parental leave from birth, and providing universal free childcare from, say, 6 months old. We would also offer parents the opportunity to either use free childcare between 6 months and 1 year, or to have paid parental leave for the same period.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should provide universal free childcare from the age of three, with the option for parents to take parental leave in the first year of their child's life instead. This would allow parents to bond with their child and recover from the birth, whilst also allowing them to return to work when they feel ready. The cost of childcare can be a barrier to parents returning to work, and universal free childcare would help to alleviate this. It would also help to reduce the gender pay gap, as it would allow more women to return to work after having children. The quality of childcare is very important, and it would be necessary to ensure that the childcare provided is of a high standard.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should provide universal free childcare from birth. High quality childcare allows parents to work, making use of their skills and experience and contributing to the economy. It also provides children with a positive environment in which to learn and to develop social skills. Babies benefit from having a consistent primary caregiver in their early months, and parents benefit from the opportunity to bond with their babies and to recover from the physical changes caused by birth and from the social changes caused by having a new family member. For this reason, the government should provide universal paid parental leave from birth, and provide universal free childcare from, say, 6 months old. I would also offer parents the opportunity to either use free childcare between 6 months and 1 year, or to have paid parental leave for the same period.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should provide universal free childcare, but not necessarily from birth. High quality childcare allows parents to work, making use of their skills and experience and contributing to the economy. It also provides children with a positive environment in which to learn and to develop social skills. However, I do not necessarily support providing this childcare from birth. Babies benefit from having a consistent primary caregiver in their early months, and parents benefit from the opportunity to bond with their babies and to recover from the physical changes caused by birth and from the social changes caused by having a new family member. For this reason, I would support the government providing universal paid parental leave from birth, and providing universal free childcare from, say, 6 months old. I would also offer parents the opportunity to either use free childcare between 6 months and 1 year, or to have paid parental leave for the same period.
