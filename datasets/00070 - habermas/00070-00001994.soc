# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a very clear and strict process for anyone who wants to access records and this process should be transparent and well documented.  The process should be overseen by a governing body to ensure that it is being followed.  There should be a very clear distinction between records that are used for research and those that are used for marketing purposes.  Records used for research should be de-identified and should not contain any personally identifiable information.  Records used for marketing purposes should not be allowed to contain any personally identifiable information.  The laws should be tightened up to ensure that these distinctions are clear and that the process is followed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the laws governing who can access NHS records are sufficient.

There should be a very clear distinction between records that are used for research and those that are used for marketing purposes.  Records used for research should be de-identified and should not contain any personally identifiable information.  Records used for marketing purposes should not be allowed to contain any personally identifiable information.  The laws should be tightened up to ensure that these distinctions are clear and that the process is followed.  However, the law should also be strengthened to provide the NHS and those who use medical records for research with a legal basis to share de-identified medical records for research purposes.
