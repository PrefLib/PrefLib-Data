# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, we should increase the tax rate on people who earn above a certain amount. The current system of taxation is outdated and does not take into account the cost of living and the inequality of wealth in the UK. By increasing the tax rate on the higher earners, it would allow increased funding for social welfare and services across the UK, such as the NHS. It would make society fairer, allow wealth to distribute among classes and would also allow people to contribute to the economy in a way that is proportional to their income. This would mean that people who earn above a certain amount would not be hoarding their wealth and would be contributing to the economy and society. This could also increase the number of people paying tax, which would be beneficial for the economy and could decrease the deficit.
