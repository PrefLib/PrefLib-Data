# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Tax should be increased on the rich so that it helps to improve the infrastructure and public services. This would help to improve the economy as it will attract investors.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is important to improve the UK infrastructure, but this can be done by using more efficient methods than just taxing the rich. It would be unfair on the hard working individuals and businesses who have worked hard to get to where they are. If we were to tax the rich more, the money would have to be used for improving the infrastructure or public services. This would improve the lives of everyone, not just the rich.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing tax on the rich. However, the group was split as to whether the money should be used to help the poor, or to improve infrastructure. The group felt that the tax should be increased after a certain amount, so as to ensure that ordinary working citizens are not affected by the tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing tax on the rich. The group felt that this would be a good thing as it would help to share the tax burden and help to fund public services. However, the group felt that the tax increase should be used to improve the country's infrastructure and public services and should not be used to give handouts to those less fortunate.
