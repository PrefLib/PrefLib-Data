# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children under 13 should be allowed to use social media, but with safeguards in place to ensure that they are protected from the negative effects of social media. These safeguards could include supervision from parents or other responsible adults, as well as the ability to moderate any content posted by the children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, children under 13 should not be allowed to use social media because of the potential for bad effects. However, there are several safeguards that could be put in place in order to allow for positive use of social media. For example, children should not be allowed to use social media without supervision. This means that an adult should have access to all social media activity, and if necessary, they should be able to moderate all content posted on a child's social media. In this way, parents would be able to ensure that the content being seen by their child is appropriate. It is important to remember that the benefits of social media are not just positive for adults. Social media can be a very positive way for children to connect with their peers, to see what is going on in their lives, and to engage in a constructive way. However, it is important that the negative side of social media is addressed, and the potential for children to be exposed to damaging content or to be at risk of other negative effects of social media should be kept to a minimum. Social media should not be banned for children under 13 as this would be restricting freedom of expression. However, it is important to put safeguards in place in order to minimize

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, children under 13 should not be allowed to use social media. However, there are several safeguards that can be put in place in order to allow children to be able to use social media in a safe and responsible way. This includes ensuring that an adult has access to all social media activity, and that they have the ability to moderate all content posted on a child's social media. Additionally, restricting the amount of time that children are able to use social media is also an effective safeguard. Restrictions could include limiting the age of users to 13 years old, and a code of conduct which outlines the limitations of social media use.
