# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People should be free to make their own decisions on what they do with their own bodies, as long as their choices don't have a negative impact on other people. The legalization of marijuana would mean that users would no longer need to associate with criminals to obtain the drug, and the drug itself would be safer, due to improved quality control.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There is insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion as to whether the use of marijuana by non-medical users is beneficial.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Medical marijuana is a proven and effective treatment for a variety of medical conditions. There are only a small number of adverse effects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Marijuana use is not something to be encouraged, but is not likely to be as bad as drinking alcohol. This is because it is not as social a drug as alcohol and so is less likely to have an adverse effect on other people. The use of marijuana should be something that is kept to an individual's home or equivalent, rather than social settings. It also seems to be a lesser gateway drug than alcohol, although its influence in this regard is still significant. In this example, the opinion of participant 5 (not holding strong views) was not taken into account in the group's final consensus view.
