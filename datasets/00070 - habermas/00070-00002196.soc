# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we shouldn't. As they should be paid via working peoples taxes. People who earn more, should pay more towards it, I think this way would be the most fair way to do it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Paying for prescriptions should be reduced for everyone.  People on benefits should not have to pay for their prescriptions.  People who are in work should pay for their prescriptions but there should be a reduction for these people too.  People over 60 should also pay for their prescriptions but again, there should be a reduction in the price for these people. The groups who do not have to pay for prescriptions are those on low incomes, and those who receive benefits.  They should not have to pay for their prescriptions because they will struggle to pay the costs, as they do not earn much, or nothing at all.  This is not fair.  There should be a set charge for prescriptions.  This will mean that everyone who has to pay for their prescriptions will pay the same price.  The price will be lower than it is now.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “I believe that NHS prescriptions should be free for all.  I believe this because people need to be able to go to their GP without worrying about the cost.  If they have to pay, they will not go and their health will worsen.  The NHS is there to help people and make them better.  If they have to pay, they will not get the help they need and will not get better.  If people are in work, they will be paying NI, therefore they should be able to get free prescriptions.  If they are not working, they will be claiming benefits and will be able to get free prescriptions.  I think it is unfair that some people have to pay and some do not.  It is not the patients fault if they are ill and they should not have to pay to get better.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “We don’t believe we should have to pay for prescriptions, as they are a necessary part of our healthcare, and there are people who cannot afford it.  There should be a charge, but it should be very low.  This will hopefully reduce the NHS costs, and help the people that need help, who cannot afford the charge.  People with low incomes and long term health conditions should have free prescriptions.
