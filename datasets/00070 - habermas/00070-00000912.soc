# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of banning private education. The main argument put forward was that people should have the right to choose the best education for their children and if they have the means to pay for private education then they should be allowed to do so. The group also felt that private education creates a more diverse educational system and allows for more opportunities to be available for children to learn a wider range of subjects. The group did, however, feel that there should be some sort of regulation in place to make sure that private education is not allowing for the creation of an elite class that would be unable to relate to the rest of the population. This could be achieved through a cap on the fees that can be charged and the teaching qualifications that must be obtained by teachers of private schools.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group in general believed that laws banning private education would be a bad idea, but did not believe that it should be unregulated. In fact, one participant stated that they would agree with a law banning private education if it involved public schools having more funding and becoming more of a choice. Another participant strongly agreed with this as they felt that many countries fail to regulate private education properly. Although there should be some kind of regulation on private education, there was consensus on the view that parents should have the right to make an informed choice between private education and public education and, if they can afford it and feel it would be beneficial to their child, should be allowed to go down the route of private education. There was a lot of discussion around how people who have been privately educated can still connect to and understand public educated people and there was consensus that, with private education, we can avoid the creation of an elite class who would not be able to relate to the majority of society. This led to discussion about what ‘elite class’ even means and some participants thought it could just refer to a more intellectual group of people who could do with less political control and who could contribute more to society through being able to share their ideas. The participants argued
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Private education has positive elements and should not be outlawed in its entirety. Instead, measures should be put in place to regulate it and improve the standards and quality of the education offered in the public sector. These measures include placing the government as an inspectorate or control over private education with powers to send people from private school systems to lower cost public education (some of them from underprivileged homes), give large grants for facilities to make them as good, if not better than those in the private sector. These changes, the group hoped, would prevent the development of an elite class that could become alien to the problems experienced in lower social classes and stop the already significant impact private education has on access to higher class employment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of banning private education. The main argument put forward was that people should have the right to choose the best education for their children and if they have the means to pay for private education then they should be allowed to do so. The group also felt that private education creates a more diverse educational system and allows for more opportunities to be available for children to learn a wider range of subjects. The group did, however, feel that there should be some sort of regulation in place to make sure that private education is not allowing for the creation of an elite class that would be unable to relate to the rest of the population.  It is also believed that in the interest of reducing the gap between the wealthy and the rest of the population, it would be of great benefit to society to invest more resources in making public education of a quality equivalent to private education.
