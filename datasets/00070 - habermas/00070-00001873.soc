# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: In conclusion, the majority of the group, therefore, feel that the question of whether fracking should be allowed in Scotland, is a contentious issue. However, in our opinion, we feel that fracking should not be allowed in Scotland. The issue of fracking has recently been raised by communities in England, and has received an enormous amount of media attention. However, it is the social and economic consequences of fracking that we feel are of the most concern, causing a loss of habitat, an increase in road traffic, the exploitation of farmers' livelihood, and ultimately the destruction of land. Furthermore, there have been little plans to address the impact upon the existing environment and its inhabitants, such as other animals and birds. As mentioned, the Scottish government is also working towards implementing a Carbon Neutral Scotland. Therefore, we think that the research shows that there are enough environmental, social and economic reasons to ensure that fracking should not be allowed in Scotland.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - After a good debate, taking into account all of the critiques, the group of participants revised the draft consensus statement and came to the following final consensus view:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, we feel that the question of whether fracking should be allowed in Scotland, is a contentious issue. However, in our opinion, we feel that fracking should not be allowed in Scotland. The issue of fracking has recently been raised by communities in England, and has received an enormous amount of media attention. The research has shown that fracking can have many negative environmental impacts. This includes increased traffic, the destruction of woodlands, and the possibility of increased pollution and earth tremors. Furthermore, the extraction of fossil fuels, we feel, goes against the principle of carbon neutral and renewable energy. Therefore, we think that the research shows that there are enough environmental, social and economic reasons to ensure that fracking should not be allowed in Scotland.

The group of participants agreed that there was a good debate and that the final consensus statement reflected the views of the group as a whole.  The group felt that this was a very effective way of coming to a consensus.
