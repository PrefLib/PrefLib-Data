# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, there should be a higher minimum wage. We don't believe it is right for companies to pay people in the lowest paid jobs peanuts when those at the top of the company are getting paid a 100 times more than the lowest paid employees. It is also not fair that the lowest paid workers are getting paid a wage which is not enough to pay their rent, or to feed their family, or to put food on the table. People who work deserve a decent standard of living.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a higher minimum wage. The cost of living is going up all the time and most people are struggling financially. There should be an increase in the minimum wage to allow people to afford basic necessities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be a higher minimum wage. The cost of living is skyrocketing and hasn't stopped in the past 3 years. Given how every bill and the cost of food is set to continue increasing, an enhanced minimum wage is necessary just so that the public don't fall deeper into austerity. A higher minimum wage would feed back into the economy and create growth. It would alleviate stress and pressure on the social system. People deserve a decent standard of living. It is not right to pay the lowest in a company peanuts whilst those who sit at the top doing nothing get paid the most. People in the lowest paid jobs usually do the hardest and most physically demanding work and deserve a fair pay for they output. People at the top of the company should not be getting paid 100s of times more than the lowest. Everyone deserves to feel valued for what they do.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a higher minimum wage because the cost of living is going up and the current minimum wage is too low. People deserve a decent standard of living and the current minimum wage is not enough to provide this. The current minimum wage is not enough to provide a basic standard of living. A higher minimum wage would feed back into the economy and create growth. It would alleviate stress and pressure on the social system. It would also mean that people would not be reliant on the social system and would be able to support themselves and their families.
