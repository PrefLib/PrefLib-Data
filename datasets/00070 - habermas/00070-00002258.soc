# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of assessing students on their ability to collaborate with their peers. The group felt that this is a skill that is required in the workplace and in other aspects of life. The group felt that this should not be the only thing that is assessed as there are other skills that are important such as communication and the ability to work independently. The group felt that students should be supported in developing their ability to collaborate and that this should not be something that is penalised. The group felt that if a student is struggling with this, then they should be supported to improve this skill rather than penalised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While it is important for students to collaborate with their peers, it should not be a component of their assessment. They should be taught the importance of collaboration and the skills involved in collaboration. It is good for students to develop this skills for their future careers and employers. However, students should be assessed on their individual achievements and progress. This is to encourage students to develop as individuals and to recognise individual differences and talents. It is also to help students to develop confidence in their individual abilities and to appreciate and value the importance of collaboration without it affecting their assessment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of assessing students on their ability to collaborate with their peers. The group felt that this was an important skill for students to develop as they would need to collaborate with their peers in their future careers. The group felt that it was important to support students to develop this skill rather than penalise them for not being able to collaborate. The group felt that collaboration was important but that it was also important for students to learn to work independently and to develop their own ideas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Students should be assessed on how well they collaborate with their peers. Collaboration is an important skill for any career and if it is taught and assessed it will give students the ability to work with their peers effectively and this will benefit employers and their colleagues.
