# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes we should! If someone is making money on a social media company of a decent amount that could be deemed a stable income then yes there should be some kind of tax they need to pay just as they would any other job. Influencers make a lot of money on social media today and a new tax is necessary to make sure they are paying to our support the Country as would all other jobs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: They shouldn't be taxed any differently to any other company - creating a tax for a specific type of business could put people off trying to innovate and create their own social media startups, as well as that the cost of the additional tax will inevitably fall back onto the customer and could result in customers leaving. Social media is ever present in our daily lives,  we should be encouraging growth not discouraging in my opinion. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, I would support the introduction of a new tax on social media companies such as Meta on the grounds of fair competition and a level playing field where all participants should pay their fair share. Maintaining the current situation favours disproportionately the MNCs that tap into the holes of the legislative framework and increase their profits massively. Living in a capitalist society underpinned by competition rules each government should consider the idea of introducing a tax on these companies in order to increase revenues and fund critical sectors such as AI. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Why would we tax Social media companies more? Instead we should be focussing on making sure they don't squirm out of the tax they already should be paying through dodgy loopholes. This also applies to other 'online' businesses like Amazon, what's the point in taxing them more if they'll just avoid paying it somehow?  What's more important is the regulation of social media. Ensuring through law that they have strong processes in place to eliminate illegal content, conspiracy theories and outright lies is far more important to society - A lie travels halfway round the world before the truth has got its shoes on - And the Govt should be involved in making sure social media companies fix that or face the consequences
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: social media companies should be taxed in order to apply regulations around social media. It would be also a component of fairness because social media companies are businesses and have many earnings. Tax evasion is a common problem therefore social media companies should be taxed.
