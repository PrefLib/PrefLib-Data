# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a ban on new cars as well as existing cars and public transport should be free.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the tax on new cars should not be increased. However, we agree that in the long-term there should be more encouragement for people to purchase hybrid cars or use public transport.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Although increasing the tax on new cars could be a good way of discouraging the use of cars and the potential environmental harm they cause, I think that taxing new cars would be unfair on many people. It would prevent people from being able to live their daily lives freely and also would increase the price of living in general, as many people, especially those who live in rural areas, rely on their cars. However, I do think that it is a good idea to implement this tax on diesel and petrol cars, as these cause more pollution than electric and hybrid vehicles. I think that these cars should be taxed more than eco-friendly cars. Additionally, I think that it is a good idea to tax car producers more than car owners, as this would make car ownership more accessible to those who can’t afford to buy a new car and also would lower the price of new cars.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we should not increase the tax on new cars to make it more expensive to own a car.
