# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should not be allowed into nightclubs because of the content and the behaviour of adults in nightclubs. It is not appropriate for children to be exposed to alcohol, drugs, or sexualised behaviour, and they are not old enough to deal with these things. Children should be protected from these things, and nightclubs are not appropriate places for children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Children should not be allowed into nightclubs. It is an adult environment and children may see things they don't understand. Alcohol is sold in nightclubs and can easily be bought for minors there. The scene in nightclubs is rather sexualised and not an appropriate place for children, especially around adults. They aren't appropriate environments for kids to be in.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should not be allowed into nightclubs. There are a number of reasons for this, including the fact that nightclubs are adult environments, where alcohol is served, and there are a number of other adult activities, including drugs and sexual activities. Children should not be exposed to these things, and nightclubs are not an appropriate environment for children to be in.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children should not be allowed in nightclubs. Nightclubs are adult environments and are not appropriate for children. There are a number of factors that make nightclubs unsuitable for children, including the sale of alcohol, the sexualised environment, and the risk of being around adults who may be intoxicated.
