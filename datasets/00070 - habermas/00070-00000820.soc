# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the government subsidizing the production of low-cost food. The group believed that the government is already subsidizing a lot of services, and subsidizing food would only increase the debt profile. The group also believed that people who are struggling to afford food are the ones who should be subsidized and not the food. The group believed that the supermarkets should be the ones to provide the low-cost food and not the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of subsidizing low-cost food production but not without conditions. We feel that the government should subsidize low-cost food but only if it is healthy and nutritious and if it can be produced in a sustainable way. We feel that the government is already subsidizing too many things and this would be another cost that they would have to pick up. We feel that the government should subsidize the cost of food but only if it is healthy and nutritious. This is important because the cost of living crisis is making it difficult for people to afford healthy food. If the government subsidizes low-cost food, then this would be beneficial for people who are struggling to afford food. However, we feel that the government should not subsidize low-cost food if it is produced in an unsustainable way and if it is not healthy and nutritious. The production of low-cost food should be sustainable because it would not be good for the environment if food is produced in an unsustainable way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, we feel that the government should not subsidize the production of low-cost food. This is because it is the responsibility of supermarkets to provide low-cost food as they have a large foothold on the high street. We also feel that this is the responsibility of the individual to make sure they are getting the best value for money for the food that they are buying. We feel that the government should not be subsidizing the production of low-cost food as this would mean that they would be taking away from other services which may be more important such as education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, the government should subsidize the production of low-cost food. This is because, with the cost of living crisis, people are struggling to afford nutritious food for their families. Even people who work and earn a good wage are struggling to afford the increasing food costs and this is placing people at risk of poor health and in the extreme cases malnutrition. Subsidizing the costs would ensure a basic standard of food for everyone no matter what their circumstances.
