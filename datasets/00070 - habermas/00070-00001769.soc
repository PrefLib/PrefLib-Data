# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is a bad thing that so many adults never read books because reading develops the imagination and intellect and is important for our emotional and psychological well-being.  It can also be relaxing and allow you to get away from your 'phone, tablet or social media.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, reading books is a good thing. It is not a bad thing that so many adults do not read books. The reasons for this are that some people do not like reading, some people are not able to read, and some people do not have access to books. It is not necessarily a bad thing that so many adults do not read books, but it is a missed opportunity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the consensus view that it is not necessarily a bad thing that so many adults never read books.  However, we think that it is a missed opportunity for several reasons.  Books can stimulate the mind and thinking, encourage the reader to take into consideration various events and character emotions, and help with language developing skills.  There are also many benefits to be gained from reading a good quality book.  However, not all books are of good quality and there are many ways to learn about different worldviews and lives outside books.  Therefore, it depends on what quality books we are speaking of and how a person engages with other sources to improve themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Consensus view: In the opinion of the group of participants, its not necessarily a bad thing that many adults dont read books, however its a missed opportunity for several reasons.  Firstly, books are such a diverse medium and offer a chance for people to escape to another world and let their imagination run free.  This is not to say that adults who don't read books cannot have their imaginations ignited by other media forms, but books offer the reader the chance to shape the world themselves in their head rather than passively watch or read about it in other media forms.  Secondly, research has shown that reading books has a positive impact on people's mental health.   Reading books, particularly ones which are challenging and/or contain some thought provoking content, stimulates the brain and helps to combat issues such as stress and depression.  Thirdly, books are the way in which society has recorded and passed down its history.  They offer a window into past times, enabling the reader to gain an insight into historical events, personalities, society, and culture.  They offer an alternative perspective on historical events from that portrayed by the media and are often far more informative.
