# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, parents should not have the right to know when their children have received contraception. Children need to feel comfortable to be able to access contraception. If the parents knew then this may put the child off from accessing contraception. Parents should have the right to know about their children's medical information up to the age of 16. The final consensus statement was achieved through the use of the Delphi Technique. This is a method of achieving consensus without the need for face to face discussion. The consensus statement was created by the group and then critiqued by each participant in turn. This allowed for the consensus statement to be refined and improved. This technique has been used to reach a consensus opinion on the question posed.
