# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Everyone in the UK should be required to pay taxes to support the National Healthcare System because we all use the NHS, therefore we should all contribute financially. However, the NHS should be fully funded by tax, it should not rely on private healthcare to supplement it. The NHS should also be independent from the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of requiring people to pay taxes to support a national healthcare system. This is because it helps to provide the social and welfare benefits that are available for free / reduced costs. This reduces social inequality. The group also felt that it was important to ensure that everybody in this country is contributing to this. other countries do not have this, everybody has to have insurances to pay for their treatment. if we do not want our healthcare system privatised then this is very important. The group also felt that it was only fair that they contribute financially to the health service. everybody in the uk should be required to support the national health service because everybody uses their services in one way or another so it is only fair that they contribute financially to the health service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes. It is important for people in the UK to contribute to the national health system because it provides free health care to people who need it. This is especially important for those who cannot afford to pay for private healthcare. If the system is going to be free at the point of treatment then everyone should be required to contribute. This would also help to avoid the system being privatised and people having to pay for insurance. The money could also be used to support other services which are currently underfunded, such as mental health services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of requiring all people in the UK to pay taxes to support a national healthcare system. This is because it helps to provide the social and welfare benefits that are available for free / reduced costs. This reduces social inequality. However, it is important to ensure that the NHS is accessible to all, and that it is not privatised. This means that it is important to ensure that everybody in this country is contributing to this. The group felt that this could be achieved by making it compulsory for all people in the UK to pay taxes to support the NHS, and by making it a percentage of their income. This would mean that low earners would pay a smaller percentage of their income, and high earners would pay a larger percentage of their income. The group also felt that it was important to ensure that people who do not attend their appointments are fined, as this would help to ensure that the NHS is not being abused.
