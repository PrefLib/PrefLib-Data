# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Elderly people should be encouraged to work as long as they want to, but should not be forced to. It should be their choice whether they want to work part-time or full-time. They should also be able to choose the hours that they want to work. This would be good for the economy as they would be contributing to the economy. It would also be good for the elderly as they would have something to do and some company. It would also be good for the younger generation as the elderly would be able to pass on their knowledge to them. Elderly people should not be forced to work if they do not want to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We agree that the current retirement age is too high and that elderly people should be allowed to retire at an earlier age. However, we also feel that it should be an individual’s choice as to whether they want to work longer or not. If they do, then they should be able to work part-time. If they do not want to work, then they should not be forced to. If they do want to work, then they should be able to choose the hours that they work. This would be beneficial to the economy and would also be good for the elderly to have something to do and some company. It would also be good for them to be able to pass on their skills and knowledge to the younger generation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of elderly people working longer, but only if they wanted to and not if they were forced to. They felt that this was a very personal decision and that everyone was different.
