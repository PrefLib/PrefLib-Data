# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the UK should continue to subsidise the arts. Art is a fundamental part of the human experience, and is one of the few activities that can bestow intrinsic value. It is an important form of expression and it is important to encourage artistic endeavours. The arts are also an important part of a country's culture and identity.

The arts are a way for people to express themselves and to communicate with others. The arts are also a way for people to explore their creativity and to create beautiful things for others to enjoy. The arts are also a way for people to explore their history and their culture and to learn about others. The arts are also a way for people to escape from the mundane and the everyday. The arts are also an important part of the economy. The arts employ many people and provide many jobs.
