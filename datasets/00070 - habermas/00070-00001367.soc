# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the UK should support the US in international matters, but not unconditionally. There should be conditions and the UK should consider its own interests first.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK should not give unconditional support to the US in international matters. It is the role of the UK to do what is best for the people of the UK, and not blindly support the US for the sake of supporting them. The USA and UK have different policies and views on international matters, and thus supporting the US in all international matters may lead to repercussions the UK may be negatively affected by. When it comes to international matters, the UK should support the US when it is in the UK's best interests to do so, but there should be conditions set out by the UK to prevent the USA from taking advantage of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK should not give unconditional support to the US in international matters. The UK has its own set of interests that may not necessarily align with those of the US. Furthermore, the UK has a history of supporting the US in military expeditions that have not always been in the UK's best interest. The Iraq war is a good example of this. While the UK should support its allies, it should not be unconditional. The UK should make its own decisions on a case-by-case basis.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The UK should support the US in certain matters not all. It should not be unconditional. There should be specific conditions.
