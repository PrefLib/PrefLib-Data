# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, a basic income would be good for society. It would allow everyone to have a basic standard of living and allow people to contribute to the economy. A basic income would be funded by taxing the wealthy and corporations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that a basic income should be given to everyone below a certain threshold. We also believe that the income threshold should be periodically adjusted for inflation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of a basic income, although some reservations were expressed. The consensus view was that a basic income should be provided to all citizens below a certain income threshold, and that it should be complemented by their salary. The group also believed that a basic income would help to reduce poverty and inequality in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - A basic income is something that would be good to have in society. The way we see it, is that a basic income would allow for people to be able to provide for themselves, and to be able to enjoy life to an extent. There is no way that people should be worried about being able to provide basic needs for themselves, and a basic income would be a way to make sure that this does not happen. It would be a good thing for society as a whole, as it would increase spending, which would in turn lead to the creation of more wealth.
