# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of free school meals. The group felt that not all children should get free school meals as this would be too expensive. It was felt that there were some children in poverty that would benefit. The group decided that it would be sensible to offer free school meals to those children in poverty. It was suggested that the free school meal could be targeted at children in poverty at the moment, but children should not be labelled. The local authority would need to consider the proportion of children that were in poverty in the area. The cost of providing free school meals to every child in the local authority would be very expensive, and this would mean less money for other services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: A balanced and healthy diet is very essential for children for their proper growth. Local authority can play a vital role to provide healthy and balanced food to the school children. Local authority can provide food to those children whose parents cannot afford to give healthy and balanced diet to their children due to their financial circumstances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although not every local authority should provide every child with a free school meal, the school should be able to cater for all children. This was a difficult topic to reach a consensus view on. The final view was reached through a lot of deliberation and reflection on the different opinions. There were a lot of strong views, but we finally came to a conclusion that all children should be able to have a free school meal. However, it should be up to the local authority to decide if they want to provide all children with a free meal. This is due to financial circumstances of the authority. However, this is not a decision that should be taken lightly, as many children come from deprived households and need a healthy meal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children should be given a free school meal as it can increase attendance and educational attainment.
