# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although plastic is a non-biodegradable material and can have a long lasting negative effect on the environment, we should not ban it entirely as it has many beneficial uses, but we should find alternative solutions for these uses that don't rely on plastic and also look for ways to reduce the amount of plastic packaging in use today, as this is often very excessive and excessive wastage. We should also promote recycling of plastic wherever possible and educate people on how to reduce the amount of plastic waste they produce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of moving away from plastics but not an outright ban as this would cause more problems than it would solve. Recycling of plastics is also not a long-term solution due to the inability of recycling to prevent the mass amount of microplastics being released into the environment. Recycling can, however, reduce the demand for raw materials for making plastics, reducing the use of finite resources. The group concluded that there is no one solution to this problem, but instead that a multi-faceted approach is necessary in order to reduce the negative effects of plastics on the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of reducing the amount of plastic packaging in use, but not an outright ban. They felt that a ban would be difficult to enforce and would cause more problems than it would solve. They felt that the best way to reduce the amount of plastic packaging in use would be to promote recycling and to educate people on the importance of recycling and the impact of plastic on the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, we should not ban the sale of all things with plastic packaging. Plastic is a very useful material that is used in many different ways. It is also very cheap to produce and is very lightweight, making it very easy to transport. Plastic packaging is also very useful in keeping food fresh for longer, as well as keeping it safe from contamination. However, plastic is very bad for the environment, as it takes a very long time to break down and is very difficult to recycle. Plastic also ends up in our oceans, where it can harm marine life. We should try to reduce the amount of plastic packaging we use, and look for alternatives where possible.
