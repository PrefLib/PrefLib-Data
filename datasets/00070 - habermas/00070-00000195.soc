# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the government subsidizing low-cost housing. Most people believed that this is a right of people in society and that the government is responsible for providing this for the disadvantaged members of society. There was some resistance to this in the group, though, with people stating that the government had a duty to spend money on other areas, such as education and healthcare, that are equally important to people’s lives. The majority of the group believed that there should be some limits and that the government should not subsidize all low-cost housing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The government should subsidize the construction of low-cost housing, however, it must make sure that there are enough funds left to be able to allocate to other areas of the country such as education and healthcare.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should subsidize the construction of low-cost housing. If they do not do so, the housing shortage will only increase and many of the most disadvantaged people in society will be unable to find a place to live. Also, this will also lead to a massive increase in the amount of homeless people on the streets of the UK, which is a huge problem that is already taking place. If the government subsidize the construction of low-cost housing, it will also help to increase employment as many builders and people working in the construction industry will be able to find work. The economy will therefore benefit from this, and so the country will. However, the government should have a limit to how much they spend on this. As the country is facing many huge problems such as the debt and the economy is in trouble, there needs to be enough money to keep the rest of society running efficiently.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We think that the UK government should subsidize the construction of low-cost housing. We think that it is a responsibility of the government to provide for the disadvantaged members of society and ensure that they are not at risk of homelessness. The increasing cost of living and house prices has left many people unable to afford to purchase their own home. By subsidizing low-cost housing, the government would be providing a solution to this problem, enabling people to purchase their own home at a price they can afford. It is also important that the government maintain funds to spend on other elements of society such as healthcare and education. A balance needs to be struck between subsidizing low-cost housing and ensuring there is enough money to go around.
