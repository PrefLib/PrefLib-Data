# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes I think so, otherwise a politician with influential or wealthy friends/acquaintances running against someone who's from a lower class area wouldn't be a fair fight. Politics isn't supposed to be based on how much money you have, or can raise, it should be based on your policies. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes I believe so. I think it’s a controversial issue and I think the public should be concerned as to where the money being donated to politicians is actually going and what charities are actually being funded and supported,  as a lot of people cannot afford to donate in these hard times 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I don't really know much about politics and donations. if this is in relation to campaigns then I'm not sure if it is a cap that's needed or more regulation around who can provide donations. For example, take the US Trump election with donations from Russia. This is what should be regulated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I don't think poilitics should be about money but rather how to help and improve our societies. As such, yes, I think donations should be capped as it only taints everything. It also leads to bad faith actors trying to gain as much money as possible with no real desire to help people. Just look at the politics in the UK and US currently and you will see people caring more about money than people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: This definitely needs to be in place. Without a cap, it leaves the process of raising donations open to abuse and corruption. Trust in politicians is at an all time low due to events in recent years. Clear policies like this need to be in place to restore the confidence of the British public.
