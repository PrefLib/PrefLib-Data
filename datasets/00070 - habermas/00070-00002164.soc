# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “There is a need for tightened up laws regarding access to NHS records as there is a possibility that sensitive patient data could be accessed by those who don’t have the patients best interests at heart, for example insurance companies. Access to this data might mean that those with pre-existing conditions would be forced to pay higher premiums, and would be unfair on the public as a whole. The current system is not working as it should be as a number of privacy breaches have occurred. The group felt that the NHS should not be in a position where this can happen again. There is also a need for stricter regulations regarding access to confidential data for research purposes as the current process is cumbersome. However, the group also felt that, anonymised data would be more effective when conducting research. The group felt it was important that regulations are tightened up to protect patient privacy and confidentiality.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The group felt that the current system is not working as it should be and needs to be tightened up to prevent privacy breaches and to protect patient confidentiality. The group also felt that the NHS should consider using anonymous data for research purposes as this would protect patient confidentiality and allow for more effective research to take place. The group felt that insurance is a key point. Access to health information should be between doctors and patients. The group felt that access to NHS records should be more restricted. This is to prevent the possibility of patient data getting into the wrong hands and also to prevent the possibility of insurance companies gaining access to patient data. This would be unfair on the public as it could lead to higher insurance premiums for those with pre-existing conditions. It would also be unfair on those who have a clean bill of health as they would be paying higher premiums for no reason. The group felt that the current system is not working as it should be and needs to be tightened up to prevent privacy breaches and to protect patient confidentiality. The group also felt that the NHS should consider using anonymous data for research purposes as this would protect patient confidentiality and allow for more effective research to take place.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “Yes, we feel that access to NHS records should be more restricted. This is to prevent the possibility of patient data getting into the wrong hands and also to prevent the possibility of insurance companies gaining access to patient data. This would be unfair on the public as it could lead to higher insurance premiums for those with pre-existing conditions. It would also be unfair on those who have a clean bill of health as they would be paying higher premiums for no reason. The NHS should also consider using anonymous data for research purposes as this would protect patient confidentiality and allow for more effective research to take place. The current system is not working as it should be and needs to be tightened up to prevent privacy breaches and to protect patient confidentiality. I agree with the above opinion as it evaluates different factors on why tightening up on NHS data security is necessary.” Participant discussion would have resulted in this group reaching a better understanding of how to state their opinion effectively.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Yes, we feel that access to NHS records should be more restricted. This is to prevent the possibility of patient data getting into the wrong hands and also to prevent the possibility of insurance companies gaining access to patient data. This would be unfair on the public as it could lead to higher insurance premiums for those with pre-existing conditions.
