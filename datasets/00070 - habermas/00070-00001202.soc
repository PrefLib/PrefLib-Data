# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Fracking should not be allowed in Scotland. Fracking will have a negative impact on the environment and could lead to natural habitat destruction, particularly as much of the activity will be focused in the Scottish countryside. The chemicals used in fracking fluid are hazardous to human health and there is a risk of contamination of the water supply, which would also be detrimental to the environment and to humans. Fracking will cause greenhouses gases to be released into the atmosphere, causing climate change. The energy obtained from fracking is also non-renewable, which means that it is an unsustainable resource. Scotland is already a leading nation in renewable energy, especially onshore and offshore wind, so these must be the focus for the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Fracking should not be allowed in Scotland.

The chemicals used in fracking fluid are hazardous to human health and there is a risk of contamination of the water supply, which would also be detrimental to the environment and to humans. Fracking will cause greenhouses gases to be released into the atmosphere, causing climate change.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Fracking should not be allowed in Scotland. Fracking will have a negative impact on the environment and could lead to natural habitat destruction, particularly as much of the activity will be focused in the Scottish countryside. The chemicals used in fracking fluid are hazardous to human health and there is a risk of contamination of the water supply, which would also be detrimental to the environment and to humans. Fracking will cause greenhouses gases to be released into the atmosphere, causing climate change. The energy obtained from fracking is also non-renewable, which means that it is an unsustainable resource. Scotland is already a leading nation in renewable energy, especially onshore and offshore wind, so these must be the focus for the future. Even if that were not the case and Scotland did need access to fossil fuels, there are already extensive resources being taken from the North Sea. Fracking is therefore not only dangerous, but totally needless.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Consensus statement from group of participants: Fracking should not be allowed in Scotland. Fracking will have a negative impact on the environment and could lead to natural habitat destruction, particularly as much of the activity will be focused in the Scottish countryside. The chemicals used in fracking fluid are hazardous to human health and there is a risk of contamination of the water supply, which would also be detrimental to the environment and to humans. Fracking will cause greenhouses gases to be released into the atmosphere, causing climate change. The energy obtained from fracking is also non-renewable, which means that it is an unsustainable resource. There are also many health concerns surrounding fracking as well as land and air pollution. There are ways to more sustainably meet our energy needs, especially in Scotland which has an abundance of wind energy resources, and this should be the focus of our energy production.
