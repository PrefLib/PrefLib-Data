# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that parents should be allowed to gift their estates to their children. However, we believe that the government should be able to tax this gift at a reasonable rate. The rate should be set by the government after consideration of the current economic climate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Question: Should parents be allowed to gift their estates to their children?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the participants were in favour of parents gifting their estates to their children. Most people see it as a basic right of parents to decide what to do with their possessions. However, there was a minority of people who were not entirely in favour of this and felt that inheritance tax should be lowered but not removed. It was suggested that inheritance tax is a useful source of income for the government, and without it we would all need to pay more tax. There were also concerns that people could attempt to evade inheritance tax by giving their estates to their children in instalments, rather than all at once. However, it was generally agreed that this was a minor issue and not a big enough problem to justify the current high levels of inheritance tax. Overall, the consensus was that parents should be allowed to gift their estates to their children and that inheritance tax should be lowered but not removed. The important question, then, is how do we convince the government to lower inheritance tax and remove restrictions on gifting estates to children?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Participants 1: Agree with question, however not in the way the wording suggests, it should be up to the individual not up to the government.  It should not be allowed to be gifted tax free, as this may encourage parents to lie and say they have not passed it on, in order to avoid paying the tax.  So if the estate is over a certain threshold of £250k, then the estate should be taxed on that.  If the estate is passed on and is less than the threshold, then there should be no tax at all. Participants 2: Agree with the question. Participants 3: Agree with the question. Participants 4: Agree with the question. Participants 5: Agree with the question.
