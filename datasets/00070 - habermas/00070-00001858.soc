# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In the long run, I think the benefits of colonising the moon outweigh the potential harm to our Earth. It would be a great adventure and it would provide us with more opportunities to study how the human body reacts to different environments. The cost of sending people and equipment into space is still quite high but it is something that I think will become more affordable as time goes on.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is feasible but unlikely. Establishing a colony would require life support systems, transportation, radiation protection, and habitat development. I don't believe that it would be seen as beneficial or worth the financial outlay. However, it is something that NASA are working on and space exploration can make great leaps. With climate change it might be something we need to look at more seriously in the future. 'Ever' is  a long time and I think it will be doable one day.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that it is feasible but unlikely that the moon will ever be colonised.
