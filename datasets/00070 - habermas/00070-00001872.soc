# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have a number of different opinions on the topic, but we have found common ground. We agree that, at this point in time, we would not personally choose to eat insects. We also don't think anyone should be forced to eat them, and that some sort of a gradual change would be the most beneficial way of moving people towards a change in their diets. We also agree that eating insects could have a positive environmental impact, and that it is also a healthy and nutritious option for people, even though we would not be personally choosing to eat them ourselves. Plant-based protein is another good alternative to meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There are a number of different opinions in the group on the topic of eating insects. We all agree that, at this point in time, we would not personally choose to eat insects. We also don't think anyone should be forced to eat them, and that some sort of a gradual change would be the most beneficial way of moving people towards a change in their diets. We also all agree that eating insects could have a positive environmental impact, and that it is also a healthy and nutritious option for people, even though we would not be personally choosing to eat them ourselves. We are all in agreement that a ban on eating meat would be the wrong way to go about this and that people should be free to make their own choices.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Even though we would not choose to eat insects ourselves, we can see that eating insects could be a very positive move for the planet. We also don't think anyone should be forced to do anything, and so we think that a gradual change would be the best way of moving people towards a change in their diets.
