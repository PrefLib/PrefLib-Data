The media should be factual and well researched and should be able to back up any and all claims. There should be a balance between freedom of speech and accuracy in reporting and the lines between the two should be respected. If the media is reported to be lying then the media should be held accountable and the consequences of this should be severe. The questions was posed in the following groups and their consensus statement is presented below:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, the media has a responsibility to report things accurately, however this is easier said than done as there are no "facts" only "perceptions of fact". So, the media has a responsibility to accurately report the facts they have and they should not report as fact that which they do not know to be true. It is also important that when reporting a story, that both sides of the story are reported, not just the "facts" that support the story. If it is suspected that the story is not accurate, the reasons for believing the story to be accurate or inaccurate should be reported. On the other hand, they are entitled to their opinions. It is not the job of the media to manipulate people, but rather to accurately report the facts they know. A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, and their final consensus statement reached after much deliberation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The media is responsible for reporting things accurately. They should be held accountable for all information they report. The media has the power to shape people's opinions and to spread false information is wrong and irresponsible. The media should be bound by a code of ethics and be obliged to report the truth and if they do not, should be made to pay.
