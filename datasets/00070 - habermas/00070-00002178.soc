# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Austerity is not the best policy during a recession. It is proven to be unsuccessful as it creates more problems than it solves. Austerity is a very blunt instrument that does not differentiate between those who can afford to tighten their belts and those who cannot. Austerity has a greater negative impact on those who are already vulnerable such as those with insecure housing or health problems. It is necessary to some extent to reduce budget deficits and cutting government spending is compatible with improving long term economic performance of the economy. However, this should not be at the expense of those who are already vulnerable in society. Austerity should be replaced with an increase in taxes on the upper echelons of society instead.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Consensus View: In the opinion of the group, Austerity is not always the best policy to take during a recession. Austerity, which is reducing government spending during a recession, can have both positive and negative impacts. In a recession, the economy is weak, so cutting government spending can have a negative effect, leading to further job losses and a deeper recession. This can have a major impact on the vulnerable in society and the government should be mindful of this. At the same time, being too generous during a recession can lead to an unsustainable budget deficit which can also be detrimental to the economy in the long run. Therefore, a balance needs to be reached. If a country is in a weak position during a recession, there needs to be enough austerity so that the budget deficit can be reduced, but not so much that the recession becomes much worse. If the budget deficit is already high before the recession, austerity may be needed. Also, if austerity is needed during a recession, the impact on the vulnerable in society needs to be minimised as much as possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although austerity is not a popular idea, it is sometimes necessary to improve long term economic performance of a country, however this must be implemented in a way that does not negatively impact on the vulnerable and disadvantaged.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Austerity can have a positive impact on an economy during a recession. However, it is important to ensure that it is not the public that has to make all of the sacrifices. The burden should be shared equally across all sectors of society. Austerity can be the best policy during a recession but it is important to ensure that it is implemented in the correct way.
