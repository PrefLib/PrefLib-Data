# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the monarchy is a good thing for the country. However, it is not perfect and there are areas that need to be addressed. The amount of money spent on the monarchy needs to be made transparent and the monarchy needs to be more open about how this money is spent. The monarchy is an important part of our history and culture and we should be proud of this. However, the role of the monarchy needs to be modernised. For example, it is not acceptable for the monarchy to interfere in politics and this needs to be made clear. The monarchy is also an important part of our tourist industry and it is important that they continue to play this role. It is important that the monarchy continues to be an important part of our culture and society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, we have come to the decision that the monarchy should continue. We have come to this decision for a number of reasons, the main one being that it is a huge part of British history and culture and is something that people from all over the world come to see. The royal family are also a great ambassador for the country and help to promote the UK in a positive way. They also generate a lot of money for the country through tourism and the Queen is the head of the church of England. The royal family are also very charitable and do a lot of work for different charities. The only negative is that they cost the tax payer a lot of money, however this is something that can be looked at in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of the monarchy continuing. The monarchy is an important part of the UK's history and traditions and is a tourist attraction that brings in a lot of money to the country. The group was also of the opinion that the monarchy provides a check on the power of the government and parliament. However, the group was concerned about the amount of taxpayer money spent on the monarchy, especially in the current economic climate. The group felt that the monarchy should be more transparent about the amount of money they spend and also make an effort to be more in touch with the people. The group also felt that there should be an alternative to the monarchy in place, should the monarchy be abolished, that would provide checks and balances on parliament and also continue to be a tourist attraction.

The group also felt that the monarchy should not be abolished without an alternative model of government being put in place, as the monarchy provides a useful check on the power of the government and parliament.
