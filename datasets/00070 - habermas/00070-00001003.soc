# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should fund charities because they have a responsibility to help the vulnerable people in our society. The government can track the activities of charities and get reports to know how to better serve the people they represent and ensure that everyone is impacted by the administration. Charities have a mixed record in successfully deploying money. Some charities are good - some wasteful - some incompetent. The UK has some obligation to fund charities -- especially ones that are most needed in the UK. Such as food shelters. We shouldn't overspend but have a guideline of how much of the budget should be put forth to these.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Charities should be funded by the UK government to an extent, but not completely. Charities can be very effective in providing a service to people in need, and the government should help them in this. However, charities are also very good at fundraising, and the government should not be taking away from this. The government should provide a certain amount of funding, and the charities should also fundraise for the rest.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK government should fund charities, however, this funding should be carefully managed to ensure that it is used in the most efficient way possible. The government should not be funding charities for every single thing, as this is the job of the charities themselves, but should be funding charities for things that are of great importance, such as building new schools and hospitals. The government should also be funding charities for things that are unexpected and are very costly, such as building failures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the UK should not fund charities. There are many reasons for this. Firstly, charities are not-for-profit entities whereas the government is a for-profit entity. Therefore their agendas do not match and it would not make sense for them to have any business in what the other does. If the UK government does fund charities, then this could cause a lot of controversy and it may seem like the UK is controlling yet another thing to help direct their agenda. However, there are some charities that do need financial support from the government. This is because some charities are good - some wasteful - some incompetent. Charities on the other hand are not civil servants operating under bureaucratic constraints - and there can be many charities not just one government department - so I think that provided the charities are monitored then its probably better to allow several competing charities to do the good works rather than one government office.
