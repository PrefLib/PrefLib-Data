# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should try to reduce carbon emissions to a certain point rather than completely decarbonise. This is because complete decarbonisation is a goal that is unattainable at this point in time and would cause a great shock to many people. Aiming to reduce carbon emissions to a certain point is more attainable, and once that goal has been achieved, it could be the basis for which to expand on and achieve complete decarbonisation in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of reducing carbon emissions to a certain point, as opposed to complete decarbonisation. This is because complete decarbonisation is not currently possible, and so would not be a realistic goal. Reducing carbon emissions to a certain point is more realistic, and so would be more likely to be achieved. However, the group felt that the 'certain point' should be continually lowered, so that carbon emissions are always being reduced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should aim to reduce carbon emissions to a certain point, as complete decarbonisation would be very difficult to achieve.
