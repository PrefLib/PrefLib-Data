# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of some form of Basic Income Guarantee. However, it was felt that the £100 per month proposed was too low, and that it would not solve many of the issues it was trying to solve. It was felt that the amount should be higher, and that it should be targeted at those who need it most. It was also felt that the current system is too complicated, and that a Basic Income Guarantee system would be much simpler and easier to understand. It was felt that the proposal would help the economy and those who need it the most.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final consensus statement: In general, the group was in favour of some form of Basic Income Guarantee. However, it was felt that the £100 per month proposed was too low, and that it would not solve many of the issues it was trying to solve. It was felt that the amount should be higher, and that it should be targeted at those who need it most. It was also felt that the current system is too complicated, and that a Basic Income Guarantee system would be much simpler and easier to understand, as well as improving the lives of the poorest by incentivising some forms of work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group in general was in favour of some form of Basic Income Guarantee, but that it should be targeted at those that need it most. However, it was felt that the proposed £100 per month would not be enough to improve people's lives, and would not solve many of the issues it was trying to solve. It was felt that the amount should be higher, and that it should be targeted at those that need it most. It was also felt that the current system is too complicated, and that a Basic Income Guarantee system would be much simpler and easier to understand. However, it was also agreed that £100 per month would be better than nothing, and would help out some people quite a bit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, we were in favour of some form of Basic Income Guarantee. However, it was felt that the £100 per month proposed was too low, and that it would not solve many of the issues it was trying to solve. It was felt that the amount should be higher, and that it should be targeted at those who need it most. It was also felt that the current system is too complicated, and that a Basic Income Guarantee system would be much simpler and easier to understand. We felt that it should be provided by the Government, and that people would be able to save up their income to supplement it and that prices would rise, but that many would come out of poverty. Conclusion I believe that this experience makes a good case for the application of the Delphi technique. The group had a range of views, and there was active engagement as well as a desire to take into account all of the thoughts and opinions of the participants. I am very pleased with the outcome, and would like to work with the Roundtable Foundation to help provide more opportunities for groups of citizens to have their voices heard. Philip Crutchley was involved in the experiment. He is a social worker from Yorkshire.
