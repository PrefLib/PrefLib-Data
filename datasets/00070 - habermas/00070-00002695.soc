# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: National pride is something that should be celebrated, but not at the expense of others. We should not be encouraging a sense of nationalism that comes with the sense of superiority over others. The best way to encourage a greater sense of national pride is to celebrate the things that make us unique, the things that make us proud to be British. We should be proud of our history, and the things that we have achieved as a nation. We should be proud of the things that make us different from other countries, and we should celebrate those differences. We should not be afraid to show that we are proud to be British, but we should not be doing it in a way that makes us feel superior to other nations, and we should be aware of how this can make others feel. We should also remember that whilst we should celebrate what makes us unique, we should also celebrate what makes us similar to other nations.

We should not be afraid to show that we are proud to be British, but we should not be doing it in a way that makes us feel superior to other nations, or in a way that makes other people feel inferior. We should all have a sense of national pride, but we should also be accepting of others who do not share the same sense of national pride. We should be proud of the things that make us different, but we should also be accepting of the things that make others different.
