# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “The National Health Service is too bureaucratic and inefficient. It needs to cut back on the number of bureaucrats and allow more room for nurses and doctors to contribute to important decision making. The people who run the affairs of the NHS should be allowed to contribute to important decision making too rather than being completely controlled by state officials. The current state of the NHS is too over concerned with procedure at the expense of efficiency and common sense which is not great.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The National Health Service is bureaucratic and inefficient. The people who run the affairs of the NHS should be allowed to contribute to important decision making too rather than being completely controlled by state officials. The current state of the NHS is too over concerned with procedure at the expense of efficiency and common sense which is not great. The administration needs to be streamlined to allow health staff to prioritise their workload and deliver better care.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The National Health Service is bureaucratic and inefficient. More room need to be given to Doctors and Nurses who run this services to contribute to important decision making rather than non elected Bureaucrats. State officials who have no knowledge about the system should step back so that the NHS could be made more efficient in solving health problems of the people. The current state of the NHS is more concerned with procedure at the expense of efficiency which is not appealing. The NHS needs a complete overhaul. The administration needs to be streamlined to allow health staff to prioritise their workload and deliver better care.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The National Health Service is bureaucratic and inefficient. The NHS is a wonderful organisation. It needs to cut back on the number of bureaucrats and allow more room for nurses and doctors to contribute to important decision making. The people who run the affairs of the NHS should be allowed to contribute to important decision making too rather than being completely controlled by state officials. The current state of the NHS is too over concerned with procedure at the expense of efficiency and common sense which is not great. We are not criticising the NHS as it is a great organisation, but it can be better if they focus more on nurses and doctors rather than the bureaucratic part. We do not see the need to change the system, it is working fine, but needs more space for nurses and doctors to contribute to important decision making.
