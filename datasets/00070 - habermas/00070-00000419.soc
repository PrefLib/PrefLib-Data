# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, we do not believe that a new runway at Heathrow is a good idea, it is likely to create many jobs in the short term but there will be a significant cost to the environment in the long term.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although Heathrow already has many runways and we should not be putting effort into moving away from climate change, if it can be shown that it will not significantly affect the local area, there is room for it and it will benefit the UK's economy, then I believe it is ok to have a new runway at Heathrow.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a new runway at Heathrow. However this is subject to there being no increase in pollution in the area. If there is a chance that pollution could increase then it should not go ahead. If however there is no increase then the construction should go ahead and then the new runway would be very good for the local economy and also for travel into and out of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to a new runway at Heathrow because of the potential for an increase in pollution. This would be particularly bad for the people living nearby and also have a significant negative impact on the environment.
