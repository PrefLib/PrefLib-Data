# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, we believe that there is a strong case for spending more on health care and the arts. The NHS is in a poor state and needs more resources, and the arts bring untold joy to people. However, with the current state of the world and threats from Russia, cutting military spending is inviting problems. We need to make sure that Britain is seen as a strong world power that will not buckle if invaded, and to show that we are a force to be reckoned with. Without this, we will be seen as easier prey on the world stage. We believe that the military should be the last place we look to for cuts, and that we should instead look to make efficiencies within the NHS and the arts sector.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “In general, the group was in favour of cutting military spending and increasing spending in the arts and health care. The group felt that military spending was too high and that the money could be better spent elsewhere. However, the group also felt that the military should not be cut completely, and that some money should be spent on the military to ensure that Britain is seen as a strong world power. The group felt that military spending could be reduced to allow for more spending in the arts and health care, but that some military spending should be maintained. The group felt that the arts were very important for the British economy and for the wellbeing of the British people, and that the arts should be better funded. The group felt that health care was very important and that more money should be spent in this area. The group felt that the current NHS system was not working and that the money was not being spent in the right places. The group felt that more money should be spent on the NHS to ensure that the NHS was working efficiently and to ensure that all people in Britain received the best healthcare possible. The group felt that the NHS was very important for the wellbeing of the British people and that more money should be spent in this area.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “Whilst the NHS and arts are important, military spending should not be cut. We need to make sure that Britain is seen as a strong world power that will not buckle if invaded, and to show that we are a force to be reckoned with. Without this, we will be seen as easier prey on the world stage. Additionally, we should spend more money on military spending so that we can give aid to the Ukraine. Whilst healthcare in particular is very important, there are efficiencies to be made within the current NHS that mean money goes further. We should try this first before adding more money into the system. Arts are there for human enjoyment, and whilst they do contribute to the British economy, we should instead be focussing on investing in technology that will secure Britain's future.”
