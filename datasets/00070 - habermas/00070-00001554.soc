# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Advertising to children should be regulated and the nature of the advertising should be considered. The advertising of harmful products to children should be banned.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “We don’t believe that advertising should be banned for children under the age of 18. We believe that a child's mind is too impressionable and therefore advertising should be regulated. We believe that advertising is key in terms of income for companies, especially in the current economic climate. However, we do believe that certain advertising should be banned and regulated. This includes advertising alcohol and cigarettes, which can have detrimental effects on children and young people. Also, adverts with sexual content or that promote dangerous/drugs/intoxicating substances should be banned. Adverts for children should also be regulated in terms of content. For example, they should not encourage children to become fat and unhealthy or advertise a range of other products that are not suitable for children and have the potential to be harmful.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we should not ban all advertising for children under the age of 18. Advertising is a part of culture and children should be exposed to it in a way that is appropriate for their age and stage of development. Advertising can be very dangerous depending on the particular type of product. Advertising to children and giving children a choice will give them more agency and allow them to make better decisions on their own and as they become adults. However, advertising that has an adult nature or has a purpose of attracting children to unnecessary products should be reviewed and not accessible to children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Advertising to children should be regulated and the exposure should be limited in order to protect them from harmful advertising such as alcohol, tobacco, pornography etc. It should be regulated by the government.
