# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group felt that tax is already very high and raising it further would not be beneficial.  They agreed that increasing tax would only harm people and those on low incomes would be hit hardest.  Instead, the government should work on developing more environmentally friendly forms of transport.  This would encourage people to use more environmentally friendly forms of transport.  The group also felt that the UK already has some of the highest fuel prices in Europe and it is not fair that our prices are higher than elsewhere.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No we shouldn't raise tax on fuel to encourage people to use less energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we should not raise the tax on fuel to encourage people to use less energy.  The tax is already high enough as it is and is already acting as a deterrent.  We should be travelling more efficiently, that means working from home where possible.  The transition to electrical vehicles is already happening and is only a matter of time before it is the most common form of transport.  We should instead concentrate on making environmentally friendly alternatives cheaper and more widely available.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we should not raise the tax on fuel to encourage people to use less energy. People are already taxed heavily on fuel and the cost of living is high. There are not enough affordable alternatives for people to invest in. The government should instead concentrate on making environmentally friendly alternatives cheaper and more widely available.
