# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a requirement that a company's board of directors have the same demographic make-up as the company's average workforce.  This is because it is important for the board to understand the company as a whole, and for the workforce to see themselves represented at the highest levels of the company.  This will help to create a sense of unity within the company and will help to reduce feelings of inequality and unfairness.  This is especially important for large companies, where it is more likely to be achievable.  For smaller companies, it is less important, but they should still make efforts to achieve it where possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be a requirement that a company's board of directors have the same demographic make-up as the company's average workforce, however, this should be a long-term goal rather than an immediate requirement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We think that a company's board of directors should have the same demographic make-up as the company's average workforce, however this should not be a legal requirement. The role of the board of directors is to ensure that a company's workforce is happy, safe, and productive. It is therefore important that they can see things from the perspective of the average worker, and having a similar demographic background can help with that. However, a legal requirement would be too inflexible, and could lead to tokenism and stifle company innovation. Instead, we would like to see the introduction of new laws and incentives that would make it easier for people from a variety of backgrounds to enter and work in the board of directors, with an emphasis on those who are from under-represented groups.
