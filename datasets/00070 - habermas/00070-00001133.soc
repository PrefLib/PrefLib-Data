# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In principle, freedom of speech is more important than the protection of vulnerable people from harmful ideas. However, we recognise that there are some circumstances where it is necessary to restrict freedom of speech in order to protect vulnerable people. We think that the best way to protect vulnerable people is to ensure that they are educated and empowered to challenge harmful ideas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People have the right to be themselves and share their ideas, but no one should be harmed as a result.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the right to freedom of speech is more important than the need to protect vulnerable people from harmful ideas. However, in some cases it may be necessary to limit freedom of speech in order to protect vulnerable people from harmful ideas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: While the freedom of speech is an important right, we believe that it is more important to protect vulnerable people from harmful ideas. There is a difference between respecting and encouraging different ideas and being hateful and discriminatory towards people. We believe that freedom of speech is important but so is the protection of vulnerable people and it is only when the two can be reconciled, that we will achieve a healthy and happy society.
