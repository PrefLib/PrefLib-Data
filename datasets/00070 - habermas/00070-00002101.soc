# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People should have a right to make decisions for themselves. However, if they are to make these decisions, they need to be aware of the risks associated with these decisions. Banning sugar-heavy soft drinks would just increase the price of these drinks and lead to their sale on the black market. We should therefore inform people of the risks associated with these drinks and make sure that they are aware that alternatives are available. This would give people the freedom to make their own decisions whilst making sure that they are fully informed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should have a right to make decisions for themselves. However, if they are to make these decisions, they need to be aware of the risks associated with these decisions. Banning sugar-heavy soft drinks would just increase the price of these drinks and lead to their sale on the black market. We should therefore inform people of the risks associated with these drinks and make sure that they are aware that alternatives are available. This would give people the freedom to make their own decisions whilst making sure that they are fully informed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final consensus statement: I agree with the statement made. People should be allowed to make their own choices, and if they are aware of all the facts and information then that should be allowed to do so. Bans on soft drinks would not solve the issue, as it would drive people to obtain these drinks from different means, therefore overall would not help people avoid the drinks. However, it is more feasible to develop a strong campaign to help people become aware of the facts and dangers associated with soft drinks high in sugar and educate people of the dangers. There are also alternatives such as 'Diet' drinks, that would be more beneficial in preventing obesity and diabetes in the nation, that should be promoted by the government. I think the consensus statement should be in the 3rd person point of view.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People should have a right to make decisions for themselves. However, if they are to make these decisions, they need to be aware of the risks associated with these decisions. Banning sugar-heavy soft drinks would just increase the price of these drinks and lead to their sale on the black market. We should therefore inform people of the risks associated with these drinks and make sure that they are aware that alternatives are available. This would give people the freedom to make their own decisions whilst making sure that they are fully informed. The questions was from this article in the Guardian.
