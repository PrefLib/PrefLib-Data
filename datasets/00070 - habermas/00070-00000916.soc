# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of requiring new buildings to be carbon-neutral. However, it was felt that the wording of the question was too vague, and that it was unclear what the term "carbon-neutral" actually meant in this context. It was felt that there was a need for more information on what the term "carbon-neutral" actually meant in this context, and also on what the costs of such a requirement would be. It was also felt that the term "carbon-neutral" was too vague, and that it would be more useful to have a specific target for the amount of carbon emissions that new buildings should be allowed to produce. It was also felt that it would be useful to have more information on the likely costs of such a requirement, and on whether these costs would be passed on to the occupants of the building. It was also felt that it would be useful to have more information on what would happen to existing buildings, and whether these would also be required to become carbon-neutral at some point in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a requirement for all new buildings in the UK to be designed to be carbon-neutral. This would help to reduce the amount of carbon emissions that are released into the atmosphere, and thus help to reduce the effects of global warming. This requirement should apply to all new buildings, but should not apply to existing buildings, as these will already have been designed and built using older methods. The term "carbon-neutral" is used here to mean a building that produces no more carbon emissions than it consumes, on an annual basis. The costs of building to these new requirements may be significant, and these costs will most likely be passed on to the occupants of the building, whether this be a private individual or a company. More information is needed on what these costs will be, and on whether this will be a deterrent to building new houses. It is not clear whether all new buildings will be able to be built to these new requirements, and it may be that in some cases it will not be possible to do so.
