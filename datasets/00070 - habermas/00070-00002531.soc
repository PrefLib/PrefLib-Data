# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I'm somewhat conflicted, as they can be very useful - hospitals, schools, travel industries rely on single-use bottles a lot. I don't think that sing-use plastic bottles are a huge threat on the environment, especially when plastic is used in so many other more toxic ways - vaping for example. I think there should be a limit set on how much plastic can be used - many companies now use fully recycled bottles to store their water but would come under the banner of single use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I cannot see a reason not to. There are recyclable alternatives and the damage caused by unnecessary single use plastics is already irreversible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: All single use plastics should be banned in my opinion. There are too many sustainable options available nowadays for us not to ban them. The environmental impact far outweighs the benefits. I recently saw a BBC documentary about albatross chicks and they are being found dead before they can begin to fledge and their bodies are found containing plastic bottle lids and other single use plastic that fills their stomachs and causes them to starve. I would rather use a different sustainable option knowing this information.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should ban single-use plastic bottles. The impact on the environment  is catastrophic. They take hundreds of years to break down in landfill and leach toxic chemicals into the soil. Energy is required to recycle them. People need to be encouraged to use refillable bottles, it'll be better for the environment and cheaper for individuals too.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Absolutely everything should be done to discourage & hinder the use of single-use plastics. There is no need for the current usage level in today's society and it only seems to be getting worse.
