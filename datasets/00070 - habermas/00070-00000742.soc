# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Tech companies should not be forced to block pornography or gambling. These are two very different issues. Pornography is a freedom of expression issue and the right to access pornography is protected by law. Pornography should not be blocked as it is not illegal. However, the content of pornography needs to be looked at and regulated. We do not agree that gambling should be blocked but gambling sites should be regulated and age restrictions should be put in place. Gambling can be very addictive and cause people to lose a lot of money, therefore it should be looked at and regulated.
