# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We think that children should be taught about both the achievements of past civilizations and the modern society. We think that it is important to learn about the achievements of the past civilizations as they are the foundation on which modern society was built. In addition, there were certain aspects of the past that we can learn from and avoid. However, we also think that learning about the modern society is just as important. By learning about the modern society we can develop the future world, and teaching about sociology can create a mindset that prioritises equality. Overall, children should be taught about both the past and the present.
