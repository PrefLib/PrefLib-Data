# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although there are good arguments to suggest that the UK would be better off as a republic, in general the group was opposed to the idea of a republic. The current system is well established and is accepted by the vast majority of the population. A republic would be a radical change to the status quo and would cause a great deal of upset and division. It was felt that the monarchy is a non-political institution and as such is a great unifier of the nation. The Queen is a symbol of the nation that everyone can get behind, no matter what their political views. The Queen also has an important ceremonial role that would be difficult to replace. A republic would be a major change to the status quo and would be very difficult to implement. It was felt that the current system works well and as such should be left alone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There was a strong consensus that Britain should not become a republic. The current system of a constitutional monarchy is well established and the vast majority of the population is content with it. There are clear advantages to the current system and clear disadvantages to becoming a republic. The monarchy is a non-political institution which unifies the nation and serves as a symbol for the country that everyone can get behind. In addition, the Queen plays a ceremonial role which would be difficult to replace. The monarchy also brings in a great deal of money through tourism and so helps the economy. A republic would cause division and would be difficult to implement as it would be a radical change to the status quo. The current system works well and is generally accepted. There is no pressing need to change it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There was a general consensus that the monarchy is the best way forward for Britain. It was felt that it would be very difficult to find an alternative to the monarchy as it is such an established institution and has a very important ceremonial role. The monarchy is also an apolitical institution which is very important as the UK is so divided politically. The Queen acts as an unifier of the country and is someone that all people can get behind. The group felt that changing to an elected head of state would be a very difficult thing to implement and would probably cause a great deal of upset in the country. The Queen is a very established figurehead that is important to the country and the economy and as such is something that should be cherished.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Britain should remain a monarchy. The current system works well and is accepted by the majority of the population. The monarchy is a non-political institution and as such is a great unifier of the nation. The Queen is a symbol of the nation that everyone can get behind, no matter what their political views. The Queen also has an important ceremonial role that would be difficult to replace. The monarchy is a well-established institution that has a long history and is well-respected by most of the population. There would be very little benefit to a change to a republic, and it would be a radical and disruptive change to the status quo.
