# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We should make universal basic income a legal right for every adult. It costs more money to make disabled/sick/unemployed people prove their eligibility ,and hire assessors and people to handle/reject claims. Basic income given to everybody would bring people out of poverty and boost the economy It would take financial pressure off of vulnerable people in poverty. It could reduce poverty and provide more stability to millions of people. This could greatly increasing quality of life and general wellbeing. It also could reduce inequality. Every adult needs a reason to get up in the mornings and if they're given free money then it removes the incentive to do so. People will become lazy, demotivated and the taxes for the average working person will need to raise to pay for this basic income. This will lead to a more divided society as resentment will build on those who are paying taxes versus those who are getting free money for no effort. In previous centuries, those who do not want to work hard were forced to, I believe there is some good in that. I believe we should as every adult needs a basic income to live on, without struggling to live. Therefore, we should make universal basic income a legal right for every adult.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of making universal basic income a legal right for every adult. The group felt that this would reduce poverty and provide more stability to millions of people. This could greatly increasing quality of life and general wellbeing. It also could reduce inequality. The group felt that the cost of administering benefits to those in need would be much higher than the cost of giving a basic income to everybody. The group felt that it would take financial pressure off of vulnerable people in poverty. The group also felt that it would provide people with a safety net and the security to try new things and take risks.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of a universal basic income, however, we felt that it should be means-tested to avoid it being abused. This would mean that it would be available to those who really need it and not to those who are already financially stable. We also felt that it should be available to those who are unemployed, as well as those who are working part-time or are on a low income. We also felt that it should be available to those who are unable to work due to illness or disability. We felt that it should be a legal right to ensure that it is not taken away from those who need it. We also felt that it should be a legal right as it would ensure that it is available to all who need it and not just to those who are in a certain area or who are a certain age.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “In principle, yes. The idea of a universal basic income is a good one. However, it is important to consider the practical implications of implementing such a policy. The cost of providing a basic income to every adult would be astronomical and would require a significant increase in taxation. This would be unfair to those who are already struggling to make ends meet. We believe that a basic income should be provided to those who need it most, such as the unemployed, disabled and sick. This would ensure that the money is being spent in the most effective way possible. This is the best way to reduce poverty and inequality in society.”
