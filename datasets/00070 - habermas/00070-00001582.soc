# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group initially viewed a universal basic income negatively, but further understanding of the issue made all of the group members realize that it may actually be a positive in the longer term, especially taking into account future trends in technology. The group is in agreement that a trial should be carried out in specific communities to observe its effect before rolling out to the entire country, and in particular would like to see how it changes the social economic status of women, and poor minorities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should provide a Universal Basic Income of £1000 per month to everyone. This would initially alleviate poverty for disadvantaged communities, providing them with a safety net to pursue the necessary education and skill building programs. Another benefit of a universal income program would be a simplified welfare system. Additionally, this measure should be implemented in anticipation of new disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, which have already started to threaten certain job sectors. For middle class individuals, a basic income of 1000 GBP per month would also allow them to re-skill or make appropriate career changes towards a more enjoyable type of work for them. There are some economic, cultural and social limitations of such an endeavor, such as the demotivation to work and perform for employees who know they will get an income at the end of the month, so it is imperative that this initiative be carefully studied and thoroughly rolled out before its affects on the economy are observed.

This measure would also have to be first trialled in specific communities to observe its impact on specific metrics, then rolled out on a wider scale if the results are satisfactory.

However, before a Universal Basic Income policy is implemented, the potential drawbacks must be carefully considered. Conclusions: Basic income and blockchain technology have a number of strong points in common. Both are designed to ensure a fairer distribution of resources and opportunities, and to incentivize creativity and innovation. The combination of blockchain technology and basic income can therefore potentially unleash a wave of economic and social benefits, especially in a crisis period such as the one we are experiencing right now. Discussion: As with any new idea or technology, some people are already questioning whether a blockchain-enabled universal basic income system is feasible. However
