# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a higher minimum wage. The cost of living is skyrocketing and hasn't stopped growing in the past 3 years. Given how every bill and the cost of food is set to continue increasing, an enhanced minimum wage is necessary just so that the public don't fall deeper into poverty. A higher minimum wage would feed back into the economy and create growth. It would alleviate stress and pressure on the social system. People deserve a decent standard of living. It is not right to pay the lowest in a company peanuts whilst those who sit at the top doing nothing get paid the most. People in the lowest paid jobs usually do the hardest and most physically demanding work and deserve a fair pay for they output. People at the top of the company should not be getting paid 100s of times more than the lowest. Everyone deserves to feel valued for what they do.
