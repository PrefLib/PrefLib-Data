# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The BBC provides a valuable service in today's society. It is an important source of impartial news and entertainment and provides an essential service to the public. However, the group felt that the BBC needed to do more to demonstrate their impartiality and that the way the organisation is funded should be reformed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The BBC still serves a valuable function in society as it provides a wide range of radio, television and other media engagement. Whilst it may not always provide the impartiality it purports to, it offers a useful source of thorough, reasonably-balanced journalism.  The way the organisation is funded, with its poll tax which is offset by gratuitous, non-means tested discount for some and based on age, needs reform.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the BBC serves a valuable function in society by providing a wide range of news and entertainment services. However, the organisation is not impartial and is in need of reform.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The BBC serves a valuable function in society.  It provides impartial, accurate and detailed reporting on a wide range of subjects.  It provides a valuable public service and one that is highly regarded in the UK and abroad.  It is not without its faults and could do with some reform to make it more accountable to the public, but it remains an invaluable institution.
