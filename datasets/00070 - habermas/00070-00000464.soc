# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the participants were surprised at how much influence a lie can have on a group decision. Some participants came to the consensus view that lies should not be told to a Parliamentary Select Committee as the outcome of the decisions reached by the committee could affect people's lives and livelihoods. Others felt that lies should be told in certain circumstances where it is a morally justifiable and honourable thing to do.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People in power should never lie to parliamentary select committees as it can lead to future decisions being made on wrong information and this can have a huge impact on a whole country. The statements above clearly show how individuals opinions changed throughout the process and how they eventually reached a consensus view.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We have come to the decision that lying to the parliamentary select committee should be illegal. We think that it is unprofessional to lie in the parliamentary select committee and gives the wrong impression to the public and the government. The select committee should be the ultimate example to the public and lying should not be acceptable as it undermines the laws and is setting a bad example to the public. The government should make the laws and not break them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is the opinion of the group that lies should not be allowed in the parliament as it will create the potential to lose the confidence of the people who are affected by their decisions. They will also set a bad example for the rest of society to follow.
