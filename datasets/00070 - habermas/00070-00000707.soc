# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People should have to pay more for insurance if they drive a car that is more likely to cause death or injury. This is because the car is statistically more likely to cause death or injury, therefore, the insurance company has to pay out more and this should be reflected in the insurance premium.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the idea that people should pay more for insurance if they drive a car that is more likely to cause death or injury is a good one. The price of insurance should reflect the risk that a driver poses. However, this should be done in a fair and transparent way. The insurance companies should be obliged to use a fair and transparent process to calculate the risk posed by a driver.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should have to pay more for insurance if they drive a car that is more likely to cause death or injury. However, this should be a fair system that reflects the true risks, based on real data, not a system that penalises drivers for driving a certain type of car.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should have to pay more for insurance if they drive a car that is more likely to cause death or injury. The insurance company should have to provide a report as to why this is the case. This is because if a car is more dangerous it is more likely to be involved in an accident. The insurance company is covering the driver from a legal point of view and therefore needs to cover any costs that are incurred as a result of the accident. The driver will have to pay more to cover this. It is only fair that the driver pays more to cover any costs that may be incurred.
