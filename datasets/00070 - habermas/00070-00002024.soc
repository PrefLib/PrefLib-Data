# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: All participants agreed that critical thinking is an important skill for all people to have and is more important than ever in today's society where so much information is readily available. Social media in particular can be a source of false information and we need people to be able to look at sources critically and make up their own minds rather than be influenced by false information. The same goes for AI which is getting more sophisticated and being used by people to push fake news. It is not just social media that is used for this purpose, it is used in politics too. People should be able to think for themselves and make up their own minds. Schools should be teaching critical thinking skills, but in a light touch way that does not add to the stress of young people already preparing for exams. This should be part of a wider curriculum so that students are developing critical thinking skills when they study various subjects, rather than having timetabled lessons that are dedicated to critical thinking.

People should be able to think for themselves and make up their own minds. Schools should be teaching critical thinking skills as part of the wider curriculum, rather than timetabling separate lessons for it, so that students are developing critical thinking skills when they study various subjects. This means that teachers are aware of developing this in all of their lessons. Students will enjoy learning that is focused on critical thinking skills as this will provide an interesting way to learn. Students should be taught to consider both sides of an argument and this should be made fun for them and encouraged by teachers.
