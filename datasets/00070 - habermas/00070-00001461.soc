# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We don't know.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is difficult to quantify whether the costs of globalization are outweighed by its benefits, because the global market is so vast and so many different factors are involved. However, when you take into account the improvements in transportation and communication which have made this globalization possible, and you look at the volume of trade which is done between countries, and you consider the benefits to the consumer, it is difficult to imagine that it is not outweighed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The benefits of globalization are cheaper products and a larger choice for consumers. However, the costs of globalization can be very high, as some countries are not as well developed as others. This can lead to exploitation of workers and the environment. The exploitation of workers is a huge problem, as workers are often paid very little and are forced to work in dangerous conditions. This is a huge problem in the clothing industry, as many clothing brands use sweatshops to produce their clothes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The costs of globalization are outweighed by its benefits.
