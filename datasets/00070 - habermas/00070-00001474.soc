# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the government having the right to restrict the freedom of its citizens to smoke cigarettes. The group felt that this was necessary as cigarettes are harmful to health and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens. However, the group felt that the government should not ban cigarettes altogether, but should instead restrict where people can smoke. This is because the group felt that people should have the freedom to make their own choices and that it is not the government’s place to tell people what they can and cannot do. The group felt that the government should also make a greater effort to educate people about the dangers of smoking and to discourage people from taking up the habit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should have the right to restrict the freedom of its citizens to smoke cigarettes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Smoking should be discouraged but not banned.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We all agreed that the government shouldn’t restrict our freedom to smoke cigarettes. We all believe that it is a person’s right to do what they wish to their own bodies as long as it doesn’t harm other people, and as long as they are prepared to suffer the consequences. Smoking does, however, have an impact on society and the NHS, and as a result the government have the right to encourage smokers to give up smoking, and to prevent smoking in public places such as workplaces, pubs and restaurants, where it could potentially harm people who don’t smoke.
