# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should not subsidize industry in order to keep jobs in the UK. We believe that industry should not need to be subsidized to stay in the UK, if they want to leave, then they should be allowed to. The government should offer favourable conditions such as tax breaks to encourage industry to stay in the UK, but should not subsidize them to stay.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Government should not subsidize industry in the UK, but they should offer other incentives to encourage companies to keep jobs here.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that the government should be able to offer a limited number of tax breaks or subsidies to keep jobs in the UK. However, they should not be used to hold the government to ransom, but rather to help companies grow and provide skilled jobs to British people. This is how we will get back to the UK being a country of value again.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that the government should subsidize some industry in order to help keep jobs in the UK. This will help improve the wellbeing of the native population and help return some of the manufacturing work that has been sent overseas. We believe that subsidies should be used to help new industries/start ups get off the ground, and that subsidies should be used to help return jobs to the UK that have been moved abroad.
