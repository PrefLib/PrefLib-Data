# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, we think that single use plastics should be banned. The way we see it, as long as alternatives are available to be used in place of single use plastics, then there is no reason for them to continue to exist. However, there are some areas where single use plastics are necessary. For example, the use of single use plastics is unavoidable for certain medical uses such as surgical gloves, or bags to store medicine in for example. In these cases it is not practical to introduce alternative methods of storing these items. In addition, there are also food products where single use plastics may be necessary to maintain the quality of the food. For example, fresh meat needs to be sealed up in order to avoid cross contamination with other items and reduce the risk of spoiling. In this case, it is important that a suitable alternative is introduced as soon as possible, but until this is the case, we should allow the continued use of single use plastics for this type of product.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We think that single use plastics should be banned. However, there are some areas where single use plastics are necessary. For example, the use of single use plastics is unavoidable for certain medical uses such as surgical gloves, or bags to store medicine in for example. In these cases it is not practical to introduce alternative methods of storing these items.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, we think that single use plastics should be banned. We acknowledge that single use plastics may be necessary for certain food products and medical uses. In these cases, we urge that a suitable alternative is introduced as soon as possible, but until this is the case, we should allow the continued use of single use plastics for this type of product.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Single use plastics have a number of negative effects on the environment, and where possible alternatives to single use plastics should be used. However, in some cases single use plastics are unavoidable, for example for certain medical applications. In these cases, alternatives should be developed as soon as possible.
