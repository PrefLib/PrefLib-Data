# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should ban the use of non-biodegradable plastic because it will reduce the environmental pollution and help in sustaining our natural resources. The above example is from one of the sessions run during the program.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should ban the use of non-biodegradable plastic. Plastic pollution threatens food safety and quality, human health, marine life, coastal tourism and contributes to climate change, and so the use of non-biodegradable plastic is damaging where it is disposed of without regulation. We could still use non-biodegradable plastics, but in recycable forms or schemes, where disposal is also regulated. However, this is not enough and we should ban the use of non-biodegradable plastic in disposable goods, and provide financial support or incentives for companies to switch to viable alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of banning the use of non-biodegradable plastic, but also recognised that it could be used in a recyclable form.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While plastic pollution is a major concern that affects many aspects of our daily lives, we should be wary of banning non-biodegradable plastics in a blanket way. We should instead focus on the disposal of non-biodegradable plastics, making it more expensive for people to throw these plastics into the environment, and also to encourage people to recycle these plastics. We should also look at producing goods that use non-biodegradable plastics in ways that allow for easier recycling and re-use, rather than a single use.
