# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: All public buildings should be required to be accessible for people with disabilities.  It is unfair and discriminatory to not allow people with disabilities access to the same buildings as able bodied individuals.  It is not too difficult for new buildings to include ramps as well as stairs or for older buildings to have this work done to make buildings more accessible for everyone.  The law should be changed to ensure that this is a requirement for all public buildings.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “All public buildings should be accessible for people with disabilities.  This is not only the right thing to do but also the law.  It is not acceptable for anyone to be discriminated against due to their disability.  It is also not acceptable for anyone to be put in danger due to a building not being accessible.  It is the responsibility of the building owners to ensure that their buildings are accessible for everyone.  If this is not possible, then it is the responsibility of the building owners to provide alternative access to the building.  This may include a ramp, a lift or some other form of access.  It is also the responsibility of the building owners to ensure that their buildings are safe for everyone.  This includes ensuring that all fire exits are accessible for everyone and that there are evacuation procedures in place for people with disabilities.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: All public buildings should be accessible to everyone. It is not too difficult to install ramps and handrails to ensure that this is the case. Everyone should be able to go in to whichever building they wish to and should be able to do so easily and without assistance. There should be accessible toilets in all public buildings also, as this is essential for people with disabilities. Baby changing facilities should not be in the disabled toilets as this is not fair to the disabled. This is an easy fix for this, simply put the changing table in a general toilet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “All public buildings should be accessible for people with disabilities. It is not fair that people with disabilities should not be able to access buildings that others can. It is also important for people with disabilities to be able to access buildings so that they can be independent and not rely on others to help them. It is also important for people with disabilities to be able to access buildings so that they can have the same opportunities as others and not be discriminated against.”
