# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The decision to take away a person's pension and their life savings is a difficult one to make. However, a person should have the opportunity to retain at least some of their life savings when their pension is taken away. The reasoning behind this is that if the person has spent their entire life saving and never committing a crime, then they should be allowed to keep their life savings. If however, the person has been a criminal or if the pension has been stripped because of crimes committed, then their life savings can be stripped away to pay for the crimes committed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Pensions are a result of a lifetime's work and frugal living to allow for a relatively easy retirement, so should be earned and non-transferable. It may sometimes be reasonable, if a person has committed a serious financial crime, to remove their pension, because this is essentially the money they would be using in retirement, but they should be allowed to keep their life savings. If a person is no longer able to work because of an illness or disability, then they will need their life savings for their family to be taken care of in this circumstance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The decision to take away a person's pension and their life savings is a difficult one to make. However, a person should have the opportunity to retain at least some of their life savings when their pension is taken away. The reasoning behind this is that if the person has spent their entire life saving and never committing a crime, then they should be allowed to keep their life savings. If however, the person has been a criminal or if the pension has been stripped because of crimes committed, then their life savings can be stripped away to pay for the crimes committed. However, only a portion of their life savings should be taken away so that they can survive and so that they have something to fall back on in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the decision to take away a person's pension is not an easy one to make. However, there are cases when someone's pension can be taken away, such as when they have committed a crime against the welfare of individuals. If someone has committed a crime, then this issue is easy to answer. It would be justifiable to use a portion of that person's life savings to compensate the individuals they have committed a crime against. In situations where it is not justifiable to take away a person's life savings, then there are still questions of whether their pension should be taken away. However, it can still be justifiable, such as when a person has been a drug addict and part of their pension should go towards paying for their addiction.
