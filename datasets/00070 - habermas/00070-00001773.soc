# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No company should be allowed to have a zero tolerance policy on the use of social media by their employees. While it is important for companies to maintain control over their brand and their public image, employees also have the right to have a private life. We feel that in most cases, a zero tolerance policy is too strict. We therefore advocate for a very tolerant policy. While we recommend that companies should be allowed to monitor the use of social media by their employees, they should be allowed to use social media for their own personal uses. If they are found to be saying anything which may be illegal or illegal or cause a detrimental effect on the company's brand image, they should be sanctioned. The sanctions should be fair and appropriate for the situation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Companies should be allowed to monitor the use of social media by their employees. If an employee is found to be saying anything which may be illegal or cause a detrimental effect on the company's brand image, they should be sanctioned. The sanctions should be fair and appropriate for the situation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that companies should not have a zero tolerance policy regarding social media, but believe that companies should monitor their employees' usage of social media to ensure that they do not engage in any illegal activities. If anything illegal is found, then they can reasonably sanction the employee. Professional Behavior Many people have jobs where they behave differently at work, compared to how they behave when they are not working. When you take a step back and reflect on this, you may be able to come up with a lot of reasons to explain why there is a disconnect between your behaviour at work and your behaviour outside of work. It is important for you to answer this questions so that you are able to come up with a possible explanation.

We feel that in most cases, a zero tolerance policy is too strict. We therefore advocate for a very tolerant policy. While we recommend that companies should be allowed to monitor the use of social media by their employees, they should be allowed to use social media for their own personal uses. If they are found to be saying anything which may be illegal or detrimental to the company's brand image, they should be sanctioned. The sanctions should be fair and appropriate for the situation. If the company finds that an employee is using social media in a way that has no clear legal recourse, the employee should be asked to stop their activity and be given fair opportunity to improve themselves with the help of the company. If they cannot or will not, the company will have no choice but to terminate their employment. We think that social media use should generally be tolerated by companies as employees have the right to use it for their personal use in a way which does not damage the company's brand or their reputation. Employees should be aware however that if they misuse social media in a way that is illegal or damages the
