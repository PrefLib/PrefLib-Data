# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the tax on sugar in the UK should be increased to help reduce childhood obesity. In doing so, there should also be an increased focus on providing cheap and healthy alternatives. The opinion for and against are stated. The consensus opinion is made clear.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a ban on advertising of sugary goods as well as an increase of tax on sugar to help reduce childhood obesity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, yes we should increase the tax on sugar in the UK to help reduce childhood obesity. However, we must also work to educate and inform people on the negative effects that sugary drinks and foods have on their health, to prevent childhood obesity from occurring in the first place. It is also important to note that there is a cost-saving benefit to the NHS if we can reduce childhood obesity, as this will result in fewer obesity related illnesses that require treatment from the NHS. We must also make it easier for families to afford a healthy diet, for example by introducing price caps on healthy fruit and vegetables.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although sugar isn't the only problem for childhood obesity, we believe it is one of the most significant and the problem can be greatly reduced by introducing tax on sugar. The tax may seem to be unfair to families, especially those on lower income. However, we believe that by increasing the tax on sugar, the number of sugar related diseases, such as diabetes, will reduce which in turn will save NHS money. With that money, the government could invest in improving public health and making healthy food more affordable for families on low income.
