# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of a universal basic income. However, we thought that it should be targeted at those who really need it, such as the unemployed and disabled. We thought that it would be a good idea to remove the stigma of benefits by making it available to everyone, but that this would be a waste of money if it was given to people who don’t really need it. We also thought that the amount of the basic income should be enough to live on, but not enough to make people want to stop working.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the conclusion that the government should provide a universal basic income. We think that this is a good idea because it will help lift people out of poverty and will also help to give everyone a fair playing field to start from. We think that this should be targeted at middle to low income families and that those already earning over £100000 should not be included.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of a universal basic income. It was thought that it would be a fairer system than the current benefits system. It would also help to reduce poverty and give people more freedom to choose the work they do. It was thought that it would be a good idea to trial the system in a small area to see how it worked in practice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The government should provide a universal basic income to everyone in the country, but with certain caveats. This income should be sufficient to live on and would be tax-free. In order to receive this income, recipients would have to be actively seeking employment or be in some form of training. The income would be reduced for those who are not actively seeking employment or in training. The universal basic income would be means-tested against any other income that the recipient may have.
