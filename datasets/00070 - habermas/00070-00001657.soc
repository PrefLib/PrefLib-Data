# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - While it is an important goal to reduce the risk of warfare and bombs in general, we do not believe that a blanket ban on all chemicals that could be used in bombs would be the most effective way to achieve this. While banning all chemicals might seem like an easy solution, there are many chemicals which are used in bombs which also have many other beneficial uses. Banning these chemicals would make everyday life much more difficult. In addition, if the desire to build a bomb is there, banning the chemicals used in bombs would simply result in the chemicals being sourced from somewhere else, as there are likely to be many ways of building bombs and many different places to source the chemicals. There are often many factors which lead to war, and it seems more important to address these root causes of war rather than just focussing on the components of bombs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We agree that there should not be a blanket ban on all chemicals that could potentially be used in bombs. This is because many chemicals have other beneficial uses and banning them would be very detrimental to society. In addition, people who wish to build bombs will simply source the chemicals from elsewhere if they are banned. Instead, we believe that it would be more beneficial to address the cause of war in order to reduce the likelihood of warfare in general.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We do not believe that there should be a ban on all chemicals that could be used in bombs. This is because many chemicals which could be used in bombs also have other benefits, and because banning these chemicals would make everyday life much more difficult. We would rather focus on trying to reduce the risk of war and conflict in general than focussing on banning specific chemicals. Public Perspective You have been tasked with constructing a public perspective statement about the following issue:  Should there be a ban on all chemicals that could be used in bombs?  A public perspective is a viewpoint on an issue based on your own personal views and opinions, which may be influenced by other people in the public. You should also provide reasoning and justification for your opinion. Below are a couple of public perspectives on the issue, along with rationale, quotes from participants, and the consensus reached. Please critique these perspectives, and justify your response. After considering the critiques, the group of participants revised the draft public perspective and came to the following final consensus view: Yes, we should have a ban on all chemicals that could be used in bombs because people are still not able to stop war even if they are willing to. Although it is not
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While it is an important goal to reduce the risk of warfare and bombs in general, we do not believe that a blanket ban on all chemicals that could be used in bombs would be the most effective way to achieve this. Many chemicals that could potentially be used in bombs also have many other beneficial uses, and so banning them would make everyday life much more difficult. In addition, people are often resourceful, and if the desire to build a bomb is there, banning the chemicals used in bombs would simply result in the chemicals being sourced from somewhere else. There are likely to be many ways of building bombs and so we would rather address the cause of war and attempt to reduce the risk of warfare in general rather than focussing on the components of bombs. We should also be aware that some chemicals that could be used in bombs are also used in everyday life and could be life-saving, and so banning these chemicals would not be good for the society as a whole.
