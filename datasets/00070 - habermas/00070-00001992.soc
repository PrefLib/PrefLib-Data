# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of free social care. The group believes that people in need of care should not have to worry about having to pay for it and should not have to suffer as a result of not being able to pay for it. The group discussed the fact that people often make savings to pay for care, but can find that these are not enough, or if they become ill at a young age, they may not have had the opportunity to save for it. The group agreed that the state should provide free social care to those in need and use the money collected from income tax and other tax to pay for it. This will allow more people to receive the care they need without being a burden on the state.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should not have to pay for their social care. It is unfair to expect someone who is in poor health to have to pay for their care, as this could cause stress that may worsen their condition. The government should take some of the money that goes to politicians, the royal family and the prime minister and instead invest it into providing social care for people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of the idea that people should not have to pay for their social care. The group believed that it is the responsibility of the government to provide social care for its citizens. However, there was also a strong feeling that people who are able to provide for their own social care should be encouraged to do so. This could be done by providing tax breaks for people who make provisions for their social care in their will.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should not have to pay for their social care.  If they have the money to do so, and if they want to do so, then that is fine.  It is their choice and if it makes them happy, that is great.  The provision of social care is the responsibility of the state, as a safety net for those that are unable to pay for it.
