# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The risk of terrorism is probably non-zero, but the term 'global north' is so vague that it is difficult to provide a definite answer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Some parts of the global north are at risk from terrorism. The answer is not definite, because the definition of 'global north' and 'terrorism' are somewhat vague. The answer may be 'yes' if 'global north' refers to a relatively small area in the northern hemisphere and 'terrorism' refers to the current wave of islamic terrorism. Some participants felt that they did not have enough information to provide a confident answer, but that the answer was probably 'yes'.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The question, 'Is the global north at risk from terrorism?' is hard to answer with confidence, as there is no agreement on what is included in the 'global north', or what constitutes terrorism. However, it is likely that some parts of the global north are at risk from terrorism, although this is a non-zero probability, not a certainty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is a constant risk of terrorism, though it may fluctuate between high and low levels. It is likely that some parts of the global north are at risk of terrorism, but the answer is not definite, because the definition of 'global north' and 'terrorism' are somewhat vague. Some participants felt that they did not have enough information to provide a confident answer, but that the answer was probably 'yes'.
