# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group was in general agreement that any funds raised by a carbon tax should be put to good use. In order to be able to properly measure the impact of such a tax, the money raised from this tax should be ring fenced and only spent on the benefit of the environment, specifically on the development of green energy sources. In order for such a tax to be fair, it is important that the government also implements measures to increase funding to support those on low incomes as there is a risk that those who are already struggling financially will be adversely affected by any increase in their living costs. It was agreed that the money raised from this tax should be used to fund research into green energy sources as well as supporting businesses who are already working in this area.  It was felt that this would be the best way to encourage businesses to look at more environmentally friendly ways of working and would be of benefit to the environment in the future.
