# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We are in the midst of a re-skilling crisis. This is due to technological advancements and their widespread application in business.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the world is in the midst of a re-skilling crisis. The need for reskilling is especially urgent in the medium to long term, as the rapid development of artificial intelligence poses a potential threat to the current job market. In particular, AI has proven capable of carrying out a wide variety of creative and analytical tasks, from writing entire articles, copy, to painting and generating art, and writing code. Due to this, many job sectors are becoming directly impacted and workers are facing the possibility of being replaced by machines. What is concerning is that this re-skilling crisis can potentially affect everyone, not just lower skilled workers, as evidence by the capabilities of emerging technologies to carry out high-level tasks. This is further compounded by large-scale automation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “We are in the midst of a reskilling crisis. The way technology is advancing, the way machines are taking over and being more effective and efficient than humans at tasks and roles that have been part of our everyday jobs, is a huge risk. If we do not keep up, we will be left behind. This is particularly a concern for less skilled workers, however as AI advances, it has the potential to disrupt all workers. This means that people of all backgrounds, skill levels, and education levels will need to continually be developing new skills in order to remain relevant in the workforce. If we are to have any chance of surviving the rise of AI and automation, we must become lifelong learners.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There is an urgent need for reskilling in the medium to long term, but we are not in an immediate short term reskilling crisis.
