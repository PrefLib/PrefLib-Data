# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although it is a nice idea, we do not think that giving every 16 year old a free laptop is a good use of public money. There are much better ways of helping children in poverty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the idea of giving every 16 year old a free laptop is a good one as it would enable young people to learn more skills and allow them to get jobs in the future. However, the proposal is not realistic because the government is going to have to spend too much money. The issue is not so serious because, in general, most young people have a laptop or tablet by the age of 16.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In conclusion, yes we should provide laptops to every 16-year-old because we live in a tech-savvy age and not having access to a laptop will cause a significant disadvantage to the kids. This can be supported by a point from the previous speakers which stated "It allows young people to begin studying online and gaining necessary skills for software. Finally, it aids poorer families that generally can't afford these devices for their children." However, this is a significant expense to the government and there is a risk that many of the laptops will not be used for school but be sold on.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a laptop for every 16-year-old as it would help reduce inequality in education.
