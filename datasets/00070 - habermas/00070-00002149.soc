# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although the legalisation of cigarettes would be a welcome step in improving the health of our nation, we do not believe that this would be a viable solution as it would create further issues, including a black market, increased cigarette prices and an increase in the use of counterfeit products. Therefore, the focus should be on discouraging cigarette smoking. This could be done by creating more smoke free zones around the country and having a bigger focus on advertising the dangers and risks of smoking. Banning cigarette advertisements would also help to discourage smoking. The smoking ban in enclosed public spaces and outdoor public places such as bus stops and stations, introduced by the government in 2007, was a positive step in helping to make Britain smoke-free, and this should be further encouraged. As part of discouraging smoking, we believe the government should also do more to help and advise those who wish to stop smoking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While the legalisation of cigarettes would be a welcome step in improving the health of our nation, we do not believe that this would be a viable solution. It would only be the beginning of a whole new set of problems, such as a black market, increased cigarette prices and an increase in the use of counterfeit products, all of which have negative consequences on the nation's health. Instead, we believe that the focus should be on encouraging people to quit smoking and helping those who wish to quit. The smoking ban in enclosed public spaces and outdoor public places such as bus stops and stations, introduced by the government in 2007, was a positive step in helping to make Britain smoke-free, and we feel this should be further encouraged. We also feel that the government should do more to help and advise those who wish to stop smoking.

The government should also do more to educate young people about the dangers of smoking, so that they can make an informed choice on whether to start or not. The group of participants were then tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on another important question. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft of a consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement by
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the legalisation of cigarettes would be a positive step in helping to reduce the harm caused by cigarettes to the nation's health. However, if the ban is only implemented in some areas and not others, people are still likely to smoke cigarettes when they are not allowed, and this would create a black market. It would also give rise to cigarette-smuggling and the increase in counterfeit products, all of which would have a negative impact on the nation's health. More focus should instead be put on educating people to stop smoking and providing them with resources to help them do so. The smoking ban in enclosed public spaces and outdoor public spaces such as bus stops and stations, introduced by the government in 2007, was a positive step in helping to make Britain smoke-free, and should be further encouraged. We also feel that the government should do more to help and advise those who wish to stop smoking, especially vulnerable and low-income groups.
