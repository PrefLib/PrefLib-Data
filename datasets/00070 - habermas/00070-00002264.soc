In our view, the issue of excessive alcohol consumption is more of an issue on Friday and Saturday nights, when people go out specifically to socialise and consume alcohol. We also feel that by prohibiting the sale of alcohol on Sundays would lead to other problems as well, with the potential for people to turn to illegal sources of alcohol, and thus cause an increase in illegal alcohol consumption. We therefore feel that it is in the best interest of society that the sale of alcohol on Sundays should be permitted in supermarkets.”
