# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the tax rate on higher earners should not be raised as it is unfair to tax people differently based on their income. However, it is also unfair that people on lower incomes pay a higher proportion of their income in tax than people on higher incomes. The fairest way to address this is to raise the income tax threshold so that people on lower incomes pay less tax and people on higher incomes pay more tax. This would also have the added benefit of incentivising people to work harder and make more money as they would keep more of their income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should raise the tax rate on higher earners as they will not notice a lot of a difference and it will benefit the country as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “No, we should not raise the tax rate on higher earners. The most important thing is to raise the tax on corporates as they are the ones who should pay as they have benefitted a lot from the policies of this government and their employees have had to suffer.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that we should raise the tax rate on higher earners, for a number of reasons. The biggest reason is that in a democracy, the taxes paid by the people should reflect the services they receive. Higher earners receive a greater share of services and benefits from the state and thus should contribute a greater amount. This is more important than ever as the recession has hit those on lower incomes hard and they are increasingly unable to pay their fair share. Second, a tax system which falls disproportionately on lower earners has a negative impact on society. Firstly, the most disadvantaged are further disadvantaged as they pay a higher proportion of their income in tax and are less able to invest in their children's education or their own futures. This then perpetuates inequality. Secondly, lower earners will often have to work longer hours to pay taxes and this will have a negative impact on society in general as children, the elderly and those who are sick or unable to work will be deprived of the time and attention they need to be cared for.
