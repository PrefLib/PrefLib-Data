# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a universal basic income for everyone, and this should be used to help people who are struggling to get by.  This would be a huge help to many people who are currently struggling.  This universal income would also act as a safety net for people in times of recession or when they are out of work.  This would also help to reduce the amount of homelessness and poverty in the country and would help to make the country a better place to live.  This universal income should be used to help people who are struggling to get by and should be used to help those who are homeless or in poverty.  There should also be a system in place to ensure that people who are able to work, are working and are not living off the state.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In principle, there should be a universal basic income for everyone, but there should also be a system in place to ensure that people who are able to work, are working and are not living off the state.  This universal income should be used to help people who are struggling to get by and should be used to help those who are homeless or in poverty.  This would be a huge help to many people who are currently struggling.  This universal income would also act as a safety net for people in times of recession or when they are out of work.  This would also help to reduce the amount of homelessness and poverty in the country and would help to make the country a better place to live.  Those who are able to work should not be living off the state and this universal income should only be used to help those who need it and are struggling.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a universal basic income for everyone, but there should also be a system in place to ensure that people who are able to work, are working and are not living off the state.  This universal income should be used to help people who are struggling to get by and should be used to help those who are homeless or in poverty.  This would be a huge help to many people who are currently struggling.  This universal income would also act as a safety net for people in times of recession or when they are out of work.  This would also help to reduce the amount of homelessness and poverty in the country and would help to make the country a better place to live.  It would also be great if people who are working were able to keep all of their salary for themselves as a universal income would be an added bonus to their salary.  This would then ensure that those people who can work are working and that they are not relying on the state to provide for them, but this universal income would be there as a back-up for those who are struggling.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - A universal basic income for everyone would be a great help to millions of people and would be a huge benefit to the economy and the country as a whole.  It would help those who are struggling to get by and would also help those who are homeless or in poverty.  This would also act as a safety net for people in times of recession or when they are out of work.  This would also help to reduce the amount of homelessness and poverty in the country and would help to make the country a better place to live.  In addition, this universal income should be used to help people who are struggling to get by and should be used to help those who are homeless or in poverty.  This universal income would also act as a safety net for people in times of recession or when they are out of work.  This would also help to reduce the amount of homelessness and poverty in the country and would help to make the country a better place to live.
