# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The minimum wage in the UK should be raised to at least £9 per hour.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “The minimum wage should be raised in the UK. The current minimum wage is too low compared to CPI and inflation. This could also prevent industrial actions in the future.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The minimum wage in the UK should be raised. There are a number of good reasons why this is the case. The first and most important is that the present minimum wage is too low in the light of today’s economic conditions. Inflation is high and people are finding it hard to make ends meet. Therefore, in order to live a decent life and give their families a good standard of living, the minimum wage needs to be increased. Secondly, it is very difficult to buy a house on the present minimum wage. It is important that people should be able to afford their own home and raise a family. Finally, it is good for the economy as a whole as people will have more money to spend, increasing consumption, and businesses will benefit from increased sales.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “I believe that we should raise the minimum wage in the UK. I think that the current minimum wage is too low to be practical in today’s society. The cost of living has risen too much resulting in a lower standard of living and no longer incentivises work. Many people do not get what they need to live decently. The current minimum wage is too low compared to CPI and inflation. This could also prevent industrial actions in the future. This could provide a much needed boost to the economy as people now have less disposable income and many businesses have suffered as a result. Many people in work are having to claim top up benefits or even use food banks to make ends meet which is shocking - if someone works they should not be struggling to make enough money to feed themselves or their family! If we raise the minimum wage, it will help people to survive and it will be good for the economy. People will be able to buy more things and this will increase sales in shops and supermarkets. This will help the economy to grow. The cost of living crisis makes it very hard to survive on the minimum wage. It is only fair that we increase it.”
