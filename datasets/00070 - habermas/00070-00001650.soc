# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe the UK should have a nuclear power industry as it is currently the only viable solution for the energy security of the country in a fast growing population. The increase in demand for energy is not able to be met by renewable sources alone as we currently have an unreliable grid and intermittent energy sources. Whilst nuclear power does have the risks associated with waste and possible radiation leaks, it also has many more advantages and is more environmentally friendly than fossil fuels. The industry should continue to be developed and run in conjunction with renewable energy, such as solar, to provide a reliable supply for all homes and businesses across the country. We also feel that there should be more development in the field of nuclear power to ensure that it becomes more efficient, has less waste and is more sustainable in the long term. This is important to ensure that the industry does not become a problem in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe the UK should have a nuclear power industry as it is currently the only viable solution for the energy security of the country in a fast growing population. The increase in demand for energy is not able to be met by renewable sources alone as we currently have an unreliable grid and intermittent energy sources. Whilst nuclear power does have the risks associated with waste and possible radiation leaks, it also has many more advantages and is more environmentally friendly than fossil fuels. The industry should continue to be developed and run in conjunction with renewable energy, such as solar, to provide a reliable supply for all homes and businesses across the country. The UK should be developing more sustainable forms of energy for the long term to ensure we are not reliant on nuclear or fossil fuels, which will have a negative impact on the environment. Conclusion The above article has explored how we might be able to use the Delphi method to create a consensus view on an important topic. Whilst it is somewhat artificial, it is hoped that this example gives an indication of the benefits of using the Delphi method for group decision making. In particular, it allows people to voice their views anonymously and be free of the "group think" that is often seen when people are

The increase in demand for energy is not able to be met by renewable sources alone as we currently have an unreliable grid and intermittent energy sources.

The industry should continue to be developed and run in conjunction with renewable energy, such as solar, to provide a reliable supply for all homes and businesses across the country. The grid will need improving and expanding in order for the existing and future renewable energy to be sent to the right places.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe the UK should have a nuclear power industry, as it is currently the only viable solution for the energy security of the country. We should be developing nuclear energy in conjunction with renewable energy, such as solar, to provide a reliable supply for all homes and businesses across the country.  _________________________________________________________________
