# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People should have to opt out of organ donation. The reasons for this is that there is a severe shortage of organs, and this means that it is difficult to find donors and those who do donate often come from ethnic minorities. Many people don't know that you have to opt out, and so the number of people who opt out is significantly lower than the number of people who would have opted out if they knew. This means that people who have a right to their organs are not having them returned to them after death.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, we think that the bodies of the dead should not be violated in any way for the purposes of transplanting organs to save lives. However, if the person is not known to have been against it during his/her lifetime, and his/her family members are also not against it, then we think it is ok to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should be allowed to donate organs from the dead to save lives because these organs are no longer needed by the dead. Furthermore, the donors families should be informed of the decision to donate their loved ones organs. This is to allow the donor's family to participate in the donation process and aid the grieving process.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should be allowed to donate organs from the dead to save lives, as it is more important to save lives than to let them go to waste.
