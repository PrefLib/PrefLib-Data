# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group in general did not agree with the proposal that all new cars should be equipped with speed limiters. However, it was recognised that there were some potential benefits. These included a reduction in the number of accidents, a reduction in fuel consumption and a reduction in the number of deaths on the roads. However, it was felt that these benefits were outweighed by a number of disadvantages. These included the fact that speed limiters could malfunction and cause accidents, they could also be removed and replaced by other drivers who would then be able to drive faster than the speed limit and they would also reduce the ability of drivers to accelerate out of dangerous situations. It was also felt that the majority of accidents were caused by driver error rather than speed and that the best way to reduce the number of accidents on the roads was to improve driver education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of speed limiters. The group felt that they could help to reduce accidents and improve road safety. The group also felt that it could reduce the pressure on motorists to exceed speed limits on the motorway due to pressure from other road users wanting to drive faster than the speed limit. However, the group did recognise that there could be some problems with the technology and that there could be some safety issues if a car was involved in an accident and the speed limiter was not working properly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of fitting speed limiters to all new cars. The main reason for this was that speed limiters could make it more difficult to drive safely in some situations. For example, if a driver is trying to overtake another car and needs to accelerate quickly, a speed limiter would prevent this. The group thought that speed cameras and police checkpoints were more effective at preventing dangerous driving. The group also thought that some people drive dangerously because they are in a hurry, and fitting speed limiters would not address this problem.
