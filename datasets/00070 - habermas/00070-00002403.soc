# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I think people from all backgrounds should be given the chance to enter university. Not everyone has the money to gain access and i think this is wrong and we are missing out on the opportunity to have more skilled members within out nations. It would help with staff shortages within certain industries. However, i do not think they should be given priority over others who are more academically deserving. I believe there are enough opportunities within study to advance if you wish to, and university isn't the best option for some people. Admission should be based on merit and merit alone. There is no reason for anyone to be given priority other than on merit. However, i do not agree that financial limitations should be a limiting factor. There are funding options available for people if they need it, in fact, i think most people who attend university have to rely on some sort of student financing. So i dont agreee with finance being a limiting factor. In general we shouldnt give priority to anyone other than those most deserving.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “I think people from all backgrounds should be given the chance to enter university. Not everyone has the money to gain access and i think this is wrong and we are missing out on the opportunity to have more skilled members within out nations. It would help with staff shortages within certain industries. However, i do not think they should be given priority over others who are more academically deserving. I believe there are enough opportunities within study to advance if you wish to, and university isn't the best option for some people. Admission should be based on merit and merit alone. There is no reason for anyone to be given priority other than on merit. However, we must also take into account people who cannot afford to reach University as they are missing out. It should not just be people who have easy access with the skills gaining entry or we are excluding people who could attribute to a better skilled working nation. Disadvantaged groups must also work hard and gain the merits. However, i feel underprivilege people derserve a chance in life because of their upbringing.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that all people should be given an equal opportunity to access university. However, we think that this can be accomplished without giving disadvantaged groups admission priority, because by giving this admission priority, universities risk alienating potential students and faculty who may have negative perceptions of affirmative action. We agree with opinion 3 because we think that the disadvantages some groups may face can be eliminated through other means, such as outreach programs, financial aid, and scholarships. Also, disadvantaged groups, such as women and ethnic minorities, have made great strides in recent years and can be competitive with other groups. We think that by focusing on the disadvantages of these groups, universities risk alienating these groups by implying that these groups cannot succeed without admission priority. In order to ensure that all people have an equal opportunity, we believe that affirmative action is not necessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the decision that we feel disadvantaged groups should be given admission priority into universities. We think this because we feel that some people may not have had the opportunities to gain the same academic merits as others and we feel that this is unfair. We also feel that people from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have had the same opportunities as others in terms of getting the best grades and therefore the best jobs and therefore the best income. We feel that disadvantaged groups should be given priority to try and help reduce the income gap between the rich and poor.
