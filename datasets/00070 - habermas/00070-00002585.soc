# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes as it seems linked to advertisements. My facebook page and Instagram are just full of advertisements. I also feel that our online behaviour is also targeted by governments.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Everyone should be granted the Legal right to know the algorithms used to analyse their online behaviours as they provide their data 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - yes, i believe we should be granted the legal right to know the algorithms used to analyse behaviour.  Some social media platforms have been known to use algorithms that show users content that doesn't give a balanced view, only shows  very similar content  along same theme and same views and opinions. We should have a right to see a broader content
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Absolutely they should, with the growing increase of online activity, the need for either anonimity or legal right to know how their time online is being monitored/used is their right as a human being. Either if they are being somewhat of a benefit by aiding a marketing team to know current trends or being monitored for some form of antisocial behaviour online, they have a right to know that this is being carried out on them and its being monitored. To not provide this accecss would be misleading and unjust. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I don't think there should be a legal right to know the algorithms used to analyse online behaviour as I don't think most people would understand this information. I think people will continue to use the internet in the same way, regardless of how their behaviour is analysed. If people are concerned about how they use the internet and how it is analysed then maybe they need to reevaluate the way that they use the internet.
