# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the internet is not a public utility. Although there are many benefits to having the internet such as being able to stay in touch with friends and family as well as use it to buy things and pay bills, the internet is not essential for everyone to have in the same way that electricity is. Not everyone has the same amount of access to the internet as others, for example some people have to go to the library to use the internet and some people have internet access at home. However, I think that the internet is very useful and can be considered a utility in a different way to other utilities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, the internet is not a public utility, however, it has become a necessary resource that should be more widely available.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The internet is a public utility in the sense that it is crucial to the modern society in which we live and the more people who use it the more people who benefit. However, it is also a personal choice whether to use the internet or not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that the internet is a public utility and should be seen as one. The internet has become a crucial aspect of modern life. In order to provide access to the internet to the public at large, it should be classed as a public utility. The internet is now vital to people’s work, education and social lives. Children that don`t have access to the internet are at a huge disadvantage to those that do. It is becoming more and more a part of everything we do, paying bills, online banking, booking doctors appointments, even having online consultations. It is also important for people that can't get out much or have loved ones that live far away to stay in touch and communicate.  It is hard to imagine life without it now. We believe it is now a crucial utility to people's lives and should be treated as one.
