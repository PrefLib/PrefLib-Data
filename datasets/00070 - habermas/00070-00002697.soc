# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that the retirement age should not be raised to 68. We recognise that people are living longer, however, this is not the case for everyone. We believe that the government should be looking at other ways of supporting the pensions crisis, such as encouraging people to downsize their homes and use the assets they have built up over their lives. We believe that there should be more discussion around the concept of retirement, what it means, how it is funded and what the impacts are on younger people. We believe that there is scope to develop roles for people after retirement that still support the community but allow for a younger retirement age - or 'retirement with voluntary community work'. This would allow people to retire earlier, freeing up jobs for younger people, whilst still utilising the skilled labour of older people.

We would like to see the government commit to keeping the retirement age at 66 and not increasing it any further. We would also like to see the government commit to looking at developing roles for older people that still support the community but allow for a younger retirement age.

This would also encourage people to pay into pensions as they would have a safety net to fall back on, regardless of whether they are still working. We believe that the government should make a commitment that they will not keep on increasing the retirement age.

We believe that this should be explored in more detail and would recommend that the government should set up a taskforce to look into this.
