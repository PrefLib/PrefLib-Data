# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “The government should be allowed to buy land and give it to the poor. This will help reduce social inequalities and provide a basic demand for human beings. The whole process should be transparent and accountable. Also, the government should only be allowed to buy land that is suitable and not green belt land. It should be land that has no other purpose or is going to waste of being hoarded. There needs to be more affordable housing for poorer people and this could be built on this land. The government would also have to pay towards this. There should be grants or benefits to those who are willing to sell suitable land. This would also need to be transparent and managed. It would be a great start to have many poorer people having homes in the country and may help to increase tourism. It is important that everyone is involved and kept informed of the plans so they can make their own decision about the move. It would also be good to have votes to see how many people are in favour of the move. The move will help to create a more equal society and allow people to have their basic human right of having a home.”

This will also help preventing the privatization of scenic places by rich people and increase the access of poorer people. The whole process should be transparent and accountable.
