# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The BBC should continue to be a public service broadcaster with a television licence fee model to fund it. The television licence should be reduced and made more affordable for all. There should also be an opt out for people who do not watch BBC channels. The participants were all in agreement that the BBC should continue to be a public service broadcaster, but there were mixed views on whether the television licence fee model should be continued. One participant suggested that it would be a good idea to also have an opt out of the television licence for people who do not watch BBC channels. The participants debated this suggestion and although there were mixed views, there was general consensus that this could be a solution that was fair to everyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The BBC should continue to be a public service broadcaster with a television licence fee model to fund it. The television licence should be reduced and made more affordable for all. The BBC should be independent from political influence, however there is reason to be concerned about political bias in the BBC, particularly during political coverage and that this is influenced by the Government, either through direct influence or by virtue of the fact that the Government funds the BBC. The BBC should be impartial and fair, which could be more difficult if it were to have any income from advertisers. If there is any political influence, this should be reduced to zero. A universal service charge should replace the TV licence to provide service for more residents and fund other public services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The BBC should continue to be a public service broadcaster. However, the television licence fee model should be reformed to reduce the cost and be made more affordable for all. It is also recommended that some of the income from the licence fee be made available for other public services. Final Note: The issue of political bias in the BBC was discussed at length but it was not possible to agree on any particular recommendations to reduce this bias.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The BBC should continue to be a public service broadcaster, but there should be a review of the current funding model and how this can be made more affordable. The BBC should be allowed to have some income from commercial advertising, but there should be restrictions to protect the BBC’s impartiality and it should be monitored closely. The licence fee should be retained, but should be reduced to a minimum level that can be afforded by everyone. There should be an alternative means of paying the licence fee that does not involve paying up front, such as payment by direct debit or a universal service charge. The BBC should be accountable to the public, and there should be a clearer process to ensure that people can complain about programmes that they feel are biased and can have their complaints addressed and the programme amended if necessary.
