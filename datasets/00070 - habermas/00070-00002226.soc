# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should definitely spend more on protecting the environment. We all need to do our bit and think about our future, and this means caring for our planet. If we do not, there may not be a planet for future generations to inhabit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The environment is important to all living things and we should all do our best to protect it. However, the government should also do their part by providing more funding and ideas for clean fuels and sustainability.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should definitely spend more on protecting the environment. There are many ways in which we can be doing this. As it stands, the environment is being destroyed by humans, and as humans, we should all be doing what we can to fix it. We can all do our part – for example, recycling more, cutting down on our carbon footprint by buying things second hand, and reducing plastic use. However, the government must also be doing its part, and more funding is needed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should spend more on protecting the environment. However this should not be done at the expense of other services. The money needs to be allocated into specific areas which have been scientifically proven to make an impact. We as adults should be acting far more responsibly and teaching future generations how to be responsible and protect our environment. The government cares more about its profits and their big private jets and multiple holiday homes over human lives so why would they care about the environment. We should definately spend more on protecting the environment. Humans have made the mess and we should all help to clean it up. We can all do our bit in protecting the environment but I think that the government need to help with more funding and more ideas on cleaner fuels and sustainability.
