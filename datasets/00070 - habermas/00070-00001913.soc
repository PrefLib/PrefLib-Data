# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that the government should have a role in reducing inequality as they are the ones with the power to make the necessary changes to create a fairer society. The government should create a fairer economy by allocating more resources to the lower income groups and ensuring that everyone is properly paid for the services they give. The government should also encourage better education for all and create jobs in a variety of sectors. The benefit system should be improved to ensure that those that are able to work, find work, and those that are unable to work for whatever reason are better supported.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “We believe the government should have a role in reducing inequality. The government is the highest level of authority and has the power to enact laws, which it can use to make society fairer for everyone. It also has a lot of money at its disposal and is in the best position to help the poorest members of society, particularly those unable to work. It can also use its power to change the system of education and ensure that all children, regardless of background, have access to good schooling. This will reduce inequality by creating equal opportunities for all children and young people. The government also has the power to create more jobs, which would be particularly useful for people who find it difficult to get a job. The government could do this by building more schools, hospitals, and other public buildings, which would in turn create new jobs in construction and engineering. The government could also increase spending on scientific research, which would create new jobs and benefit the country in the long-term. By using its power, resources, and money to create more jobs, build more schools, and help the most vulnerable members of society, the government can help reduce inequality and create a fairer society for all.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that the government should have a role in reducing inequality as it is the government that has the power to make a change and create a fairer society for all. The government should use its power to create a fairer economy and society for all members.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government should have a role in reducing inequality as the inequality gap is growing, the people in charge of the country have a responsibility to look after the people that live there.
