# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Medical research on animals is necessary for medical progress. It is important to minimise harm to animals and to use them in the most efficient way possible. The research should be of the highest quality and should not be done for trivial purposes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is not morally right to use animals in medical research, but where there is no other alternative and the potential to alleviate human suffering and extend human life is significant, it may be deemed justifiable. In this case, we would advocate for a stringent and high-quality test to ensure that as few animals as possible are used in the research, and that the animals do not suffer unnecessarily. We would also advocate that a clear distinction be made between vital and unnecessary research.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe it is right to use animals in medical research as long as it is strictly regulated and if the outcome is the improvement of a large number of lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Medical research on animals is necessary for the progression of medicine. It is essential that the research is done in a humane way, and that the research is of high quality. The research should not be done for frivolous reasons, such as for cosmetic purposes, but for the purpose of saving lives and reducing human suffering. The research should be done in a way that minimises the suffering of the animals, and that the animals are treated with respect. The research should not be done for frivolous reasons, such as for cosmetic purposes, but for the purpose of saving lives and reducing human suffering.
