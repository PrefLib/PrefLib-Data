# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should not be taught about gender fluidity, but instead taught that they should accept other people regardless of their gender. This is not only a more positive message to send out, but also helps with bullying. Gender fluidity should be taught to children who are in the minority of being gender fluid, in order to make them feel comfortable. Children are too young to be taught about it in the way adults understand it. They are more likely to misunderstand and be confused about it. There are many other subjects they need to be taught and this should not take priority.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Children should not be taught about gender fluidity. Children should not be exposed to the idea of gender fluidity before the age of 18 and I feel like teaching them about it before then may influence them to change things about themselves that they may later regret.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should not be taught about gender fluidity. Children are not able to fully understand the topic and it is not something that they should be made aware of at such a young age. They should be taught to accept others for who they are and not to judge others based on their appearance or gender. The group felt that the topic of gender fluidity is a very complex one and is not something that children are able to understand.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children should not be taught about gender fluidity in schools. Children are suggestable and can be easily influenced. The fact that it is not legal to change sex until the age of 18 also shows that children are not ready to learn about this topic. It is not a topic that is necessary to learn about at a young age. It is more of a modern concept that has only recently been talked about. Children should be taught to accept others for who they are and not to judge.
