# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of setting a minimum price for alcohol. We argued that as long as the price is set low enough not to put people off drinking entirely, it could be an effective way of regulating consumption. People will still drink, but they will be less likely to get so drunk as they are buying a higher quality product. Also, a higher price could mean that people will think more carefully about their choices, for example, whether to drive home after drinking. The people that it would affect the most are those that drink to get drunk and who buy cheap, low quality alcohol. If you are paying a reasonable amount for alcohol, you are more likely to enjoy it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a minimum price set for alcohol by Government to help reduce the negative health consequences associated with alcohol and to further fund the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a minimum price for alcohol as it will help to reduce harm and also help fund the NHS. The minimum price should not be too high as this would alienate parts of the population and lead to a black market. It should be set high enough to stop very cheap alcohol that can be easily abused, is of low quality or can be detrimental to health relative to higher priced brands. It should be set in a way that it is not too hard to implement, for example by setting a minimum price per unit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a minimum price for alcohol. This is because it is too cheap and easily accessible for people to buy alcohol, which can lead to alcohol abuse and health problems. The minimum price should not be too high though, as this would alienate people and lead to a black market. The minimum price should be set at a level that is just high enough to deter people from buying the very cheapest alcohol, but not so high that it becomes unaffordable for most people.
