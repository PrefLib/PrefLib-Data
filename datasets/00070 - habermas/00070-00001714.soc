# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, it is the responsibility of all UK companies with more than 250 employees to disclose their gender pay gap. This is a topic that has been neglected for far too long, and only now is coming into the public eye. The group was in agreement that it is not only the responsibility of these companies to disclose their gender pay gap, but also their responsibility to take action to eradicate this problem. The group had an interesting debate on the possibility of making all UK companies disclose their gender pay gap, but decided that this was not neccessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: All UK companies should be required to disclose their gender pay gap.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: All companies with more than 250 employees should be required to disclose their gender pay gap. The group agreed that this is the right thing to do.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the conclusion that the gender pay gap should be disclosed by all UK companies with more than 250 employees. This is because we believe that it is unfair that some employees are paid less than others for doing the same job. The information should be made public, so that people can make informed decisions about the companies they work for. It is also important that companies with less than 250 employees also disclose their gender pay gap.
