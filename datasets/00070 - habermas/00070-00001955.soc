# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The practice of people buying early graves for their loved ones is a very reasonable and well-meaning gesture. It is the kind of act that helps unite families and friends in death as in life and is a very positive action. It also ensures that, where space is limited, everyone has the same opportunities to be buried with their loved ones. However, as our population grows and space for burials becomes more limited, the system may need to change. It may be that at some point in the future it becomes necessary for those families who wish to be buried together to have their bodies moved after a set period of time in order to give others the same opportunities. In this case, the government would need to take steps to ensure that those already buried remain buried where they are and are not disturbed, and that families would be informed of this change well in advance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should be allowed to pay for an early grave so they can be buried alongside their loved ones. This is something that can provide peace of mind for people who are nearing the end of their lives and it also means that when they die, their family do not have to worry about organising a burial.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should be allowed to pay for an early grave so they can be buried alongside their loved ones. The right to be buried alongside loved ones is an important right that should be protected. It is also important that people are able to plan for their death and the future of their loved ones. There is no harm in people being able to pay for an early grave. This will provide them with peace of mind that they will be buried alongside their loved ones and will also provide their loved ones with peace of mind that they will be buried alongside their loved ones. The only potential issue with this is that as the population grows, there will be less land available for burials. This means that there will be less land available for early graves to be purchased. However, if people are able to pay for an early grave, then this will ensure that they are buried alongside their loved ones.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, people should be allowed to pay for an early grave so they can be buried alongside their loved ones.  This is particularly important for couples who wish to be buried together, and who may wish to reserve a plot together in advance of one partner dying.  This is also the case for families where the children may wish to be buried with their parents, and for parents who may wish to be buried with their children.  This is a comfort to the living, and is an important consideration.  However, there may be cases where it is not possible to reserve a plot for a long period of time, for example if the person who has bought the plot lives a long life, or if there is not enough space in the cemetery.  This is something that needs to be considered, and there should be a balance between the needs of the living and the needs of future generations.
