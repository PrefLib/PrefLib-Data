# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - A voluntary jury service would be made up of people with alterior motives - people who are against incarceration in almost all circumstances etc. On the other hand, jury service is a great inconvenience to most working people. I would support the status quo, compulsory jury service, but give people greater compensation to make up for missed work, increase funds available for childcare, etc.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - This question is a very difficult one for me. I do agree that they should require you to do the service. It is part of being a citizen of the country and at the end of the day if it was optional then it would not represent a fair and accurate deomgraphic of people. However, based on the knowledge I have for this they do not compensate you very well for your time. The amount of money isn't that much and it could interupt with key work you are doing at your job. I do think though that it is a vital role for the public to undertake and I would feel far more worried if it was voluntary or they selected the people via a method that was less random. In a situatioin like this where as much equality is needed as possible I do believe this is the best way. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I believe taking part in jury service helps to give a fair outcome to the people in court. taking part in jury service allows matters to be dealt with as there are always people available to go and take part. where the jury is made up of people from all backgrounds it saves biased judgements being made.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I have a neutral stance on this topic because I do not know much about it.  I understand that the government need people to act as impartial jury members during court cases.  So in this regard I think that yes the government should require people to do jury service.  However I also think there are instances where some people wouldn't be able to attend jury service - for example if they are in any way disabled, or disadvantaged and unable to miss work, or have children to take care of.  So therefore I don't think that ALL people should be required to do jury service.  This is what I read the original statement as - ALL people.  In this question it asks if I should be required to do jury service.  Again, I think in some respects yes (because I am physically and mentally able to - and it is needed in our justice system).  I also think I should not be required to because I am self-employed and taking time off work means I won't be able to have an income for that time.  So I sit somewhere in the middle, as indicated by my response of 'neutral'.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I believe is fair that a government requires random registered citizens to act as jurys, I personally don't trust how trustworthy popular jurys could be
