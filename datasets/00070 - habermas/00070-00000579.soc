# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should not have a minimum unit price for alcohol. The vast majority of people who drink do so responsibly. The state should not have to step in and impose further controls and regulations just because a small minority of people are unable to control themselves. The critiques show that people are listening to each other and modifying their view as a result. It shows a way to get past the polarised shouting and arguing to a shared consensus view. This is the beginning of the win-win mindset.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should not have a minimum unit price for alcohol. The vast majority of people who drink do so responsibly. In the vast majority of cases it is not alcohol that is the problem, but rather the person consuming the alcohol. It is the responsibility of parents to control how much alcohol their children consume and if parents are unable to do this, then the state should not have to. Alcohol should not be made more expensive for everyone, just because a small minority of people are unable to control themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We do not think we should have a minimum unit price for alcohol. The vast majority of people who drink do so responsibly. It is not the drink that is the problem, but rather the person consuming the alcohol. It is the responsibility of parents to control how much alcohol their children consume. Raising the price of alcohol will make it more difficult for those who are already responsible, and will not solve the problem for those who are not.
