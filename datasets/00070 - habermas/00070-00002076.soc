# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, the group of participants have come to the consensus view that we should not have a no-fly zone over central London as it would be impossible to implement and could have adverse effects. It would not reduce pollution levels in London as the planes would have to fly over other areas and could increase pollution in those areas. It would be very difficult to implement as the no-fly zone would have to be very large to ensure that all planes avoided central London. It would also be very difficult to implement as there are many airports in London and planes would have to be re-routed which could cause longer flight times and other issues. It would also be very expensive to implement and the costs would outweigh the benefits. The current pollution levels in London are not high enough to warrant a no-fly zone and it would not be worth the effort. The group of participants have come to the consensus view that other options should be considered to reduce pollution in London and that the no-fly zone is not a good option.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, the group of participants have come to the consensus view that we should not have a no-fly zone over central London as it would be impossible to implement, increase pollution in other areas and cause more economic problems and disruptions to flights. It would not reduce pollution levels in London as the planes would have to fly over other areas and could increase pollution in those areas. It would be very difficult to implement as the no-fly zone would have to be very large to ensure that all planes avoided central London. It would also be very difficult to implement as there are many airports in London and planes would have to be re-routed which could cause longer flight times and other issues. It would also be very expensive to implement and the costs would outweigh the benefits. The current pollution levels in London are not high enough to warrant a no-fly zone and it would not be worth the effort.

It would also be very expensive to implement and the costs would outweigh the benefits. The current pollution levels in London are not high enough to warrant a no-fly zone and it would not be worth the effort.  This project was designed to elicit critical thinking about this complex issue. It is envisaged that participants will take away a better understanding of issues in air travel from this project.  The project will take place on Wednesday, 23rd April 2014, between 4:30 pm - 7:30 pm.
