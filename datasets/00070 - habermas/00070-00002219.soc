# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a balance between the two. The protection of endangered species is of upmost importance, but rural industries also need to be protected. It is important to note that the protection of endangered species may have an impact on rural industries, but we feel that it is important that we try to preserve the species that are endangered as a result of human influence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a balance between the two. The protection of endangered species is of upmost importance, but rural industries also need to be protected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a balance between the two. The protection of endangered species is of upmost importance, but rural industries also need to be protected. Endangered species should be prioritised over rural industries as they are vital to the ecosystem and more valuable. It is also important to preserve rural industries as well though to ensure their livelihoods. I feel there must be a combination of the both to make it work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a balance between the two. The protection of endangered species is of upmost importance, but rural industries also need to be protected. However, if compromising is required we believe that measures for protection of endangered species are necessary even if they affect rural industries in the short term. Over time, we will hope to repopulate species that have been endangered, and also work with rural industries to see how they can best continue their work whilst limiting their impact on the environment.
