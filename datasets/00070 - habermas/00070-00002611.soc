# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: i think yes they should increase taxes on the rich, mainly people in the governemnt. they have 3-4 houses being paid a ridiculous amount of money for nothing. They should be paying alot more tax on their money which could be put towards healthcare or something to help the economy
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I dont like to say taxes on rich should be increased. I do believe that tax bands should be more demanding when you go higher which makes a fair envirmoent because the essential cost of living is the same for poor and the rich. The more you earn the more you can give back to goverment and you will also get this back in terms of service, heathcare, protection and a higher standarts of life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: As someone who has grown up with no money, I would say yes to this. Not necessarily by a huge amount but definitely "enough" to help the economy more and to put towards helping others in need - mental health, NHS, education, and much much more. Right now, it always seems that the rich get richer and have amazing lives, while no matter how much and how hard the average Joe/Jane work and try, they are still in a big hole trying to make ends meet and get out.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I  do not feel that the rich should be made to pay more taxes as most of us have had the same chances in life. Why should people with more money pay more when most will have worked hard to obtain it.  A lot of richer people pay tax two or three time over on their money - paying income tax when they earn, paying capital gains after investing the money they have earned and inheritance tax when they die. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Yes, we currently have a really bad cost of living crisis in our country with millions of families struggling to pay for the very basics, meanwhile, you have a lot of rich people exploiting the situation and getting even richer with absolutely no care or regard for everyday people. We need to be able to have more money to invest in schools, social services, the environment etc and a great way to get more money is to tax the rich who have far more than enough.
