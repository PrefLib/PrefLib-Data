# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of banning the use of single-use plastic bags in the UK. The general feeling was that the bags are a waste of resources and damaging to the environment. However, it was also recognised that the bags are convenient and that people should be allowed to make their own choices. The group felt that the bags should be banned, but that people should be allowed to buy them if they really need to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a ban on single-use plastic bags in the UK. The group felt that it was important to consider the convenience of single-use plastic bags for shoppers. However, the group felt that the convenience of plastic bags was not a good enough reason to continue using them. The group felt that plastic bags are a waste of resources and that there are plenty of other options available for shoppers. The group felt that the government should do more to educate people about the environmental impact of single-use plastic bags. The group felt that a ban on single-use plastic bags would be a good thing for the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although there are good arguments for and against banning the use of single-use plastic bags in the UK, we believe that the use of such bags should be banned as they are very damaging to the environment and have a very negative impact on it. There are many alternatives to single-use plastic bags that can be used, such as bags for life, bagbacks and shopping trolleys, and these should be encouraged and promoted by supermarkets and other retailers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of a ban on single-use plastic bags in the UK. The general consensus was that this would be a good thing for the environment and would encourage people to use reusable bags. However, it was also felt that it would be difficult to police such a ban, and that it would be difficult to enforce. It was also felt that some people may be disadvantaged by such a ban, such as those who do not have access to a car and would therefore be unable to transport their shopping home. The group also felt that people would still use single-use plastic bags, even if they were banned, and that it would be difficult to stop people from doing so.
