# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It's not time to ban all cars from the city centres. This would affect all sectors of the economy and peoples jobs and livelihood. Alternatives to car travel would not be able to cope with higher demand. There are some positives. There will be more green spaces and the city would be more walkable. The negatives outweigh the positives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I think that a blanket ban on all areas of the city centre is not a good idea. However, providing more pedestrian areas, green spaces and improved cycle tracks through the cities would help to improve people's experiences. The knock on effect of reducing cars from city centres is also a climate response by reducing carbon use and other emissions into areas that are already overloaded from other sources. Essentially, I think that it would be a good idea to reduce cars in city centres, but not necessarily ban them all from all areas. This must also be balanced with improved public transport 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is definitely not time to ban all cars from the city centre. City centres need cars, drivers, parking spaces in order to thrive. If people do not have a convenient way to get into the city centre then city centres will die out and people won't go shopping in them or to eat dinner. People will instead get takeaways or go into other city centres that allow cars. They will shop in retail parks. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I don't believe this it should at this current time period, due to the cost of living and other factors, not all people can afford to not use a vehicle to go to their jobs. I think it is very important to consider the impacts this ban might have towards the general household/population. I think there should be restrictions presented on certain fuel types/emissions however again not everyone can afford an environmentally clean vehicle. They should promote, incentivise and improve public transport if a ban is considered.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I think cars should be banned from the city centre.  It will improve the environment such as air quality and noise pollution, therefore make them nicer places to be.  This would in turn improve the turnover of local businesses.  It will make it safer for children and the elderly to walk around and enjoy.
