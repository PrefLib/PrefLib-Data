# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of having a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. The group felt that it was important to acknowledge the contributions that everyone has made to our country, especially if they have been generally forgotten. The group felt that it was important to celebrate the achievements of historically marginalised groups, and that it would be a good way to give them more recognition for what they have accomplished. The group felt that it would also give us more hope for the rest of humanity, and what we can do to better the lives of other people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. The group felt that this would be a good way to give recognition to those who have been historically overlooked. However, the group also felt that this could be a tokenistic gesture, and that more could be done to properly mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. The group felt that the best way to do this would be to teach these contributions in schools, and to make them a more integral part of the curriculum.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should have a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. This is because it gives those people more recognition for what they have accomplished. A lot of people might not be celebrated even though they had achieved quite a number of things. Furthermore, it can give us more hope for the rest of humanity, and what we can do to better the lives of other people. It is also important to acknowledge the contributions that everyone has made to our country, especially if they have been generally forgotten. It's something that probably wouldn't be seen as necessary by a lot of non-marginalised people, but that's kind of the point. Marginalised people are often overlooked.
