# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Class divisions are antiquated and serve no good to society. They should be eliminated. We should aim to eliminate class divisions and make society more equal and fair. The aim should be to lift up the lower classes and reduce inequality.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should aim to eliminate class divisions and make society more equal and fair but there is now only really two or three classes that exist and inequality is growing ever larger. We have people still living in poverty and all the classes would agree that we want to eliminate poverty so should start by eliminating any under class. We then have the greater majority which is working age people who then become retired and then we have a super rich elite that have the vast majority of wealth and are avoiding tax and redistribution of that wealth because we are taxing income too much and wealth too little. We should have the aim and goal of lifting up the lower classes to reduce inequality but that is getting harder to achieve as more wealth is being hoarded by a minority that want to keep the class divisions and a society divided that looks down rather than up and places blame in the wrong direction.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Class divisions should be eliminated in society. They are a relic of a feudal age and serve no good to society overall. If we want to live in a meritocracy as we claim, then there should be no advantages or disadvantages to being born to a certain set of parents. Equality of opportunity allows for a more active, fair and happier society. Serious societal change is not easy to achieve, but conversations about what people want their society to look like are important, and abolition of the monarch and the House of Lords as well as other holdover structures should be held, with informed debate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Class divisions should be eliminated in our society.  It is clear that there is no good that comes from class divisions, as the name suggests they divide society and provide a breeding ground for anger and conflict.  However, class divisions seem to be an almost inevitable by-product of the capitalist system.  As long as there are rich and poor there will be class divisions.  Finding a way to end class divisions is a very difficult process.
