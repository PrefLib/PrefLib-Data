# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should not have the power to block the press from publishing stories that are harmful to the country. The press is a vital part of any democracy and it is their duty to hold the government to account and to publish stories that will help to make the country better. If the press is not allowed to publish these stories, then it will be difficult to keep the government in check and the citizens will not be made aware of things that could be harmful to the country. The government should not be allowed to sugar coat the realities of a country even if that means letting the press publish stories which could be harmful. All democracy should be build on the idea of a free press and allowing the truth, no matter how ugly, to be told.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that the press should be allowed to publish stories that are harmful to the country. A free press is an essential part of a free society. The press should be able to publish anything they want, as long as it is true. This is important to allow people to know what is going on in the country. If the government censors the press, it could lead to a lack of trust from the citizens. This could also lead to a lack of transparency from the government. The citizens should be able to hold the government accountable. If the government is allowed to censor the press, it could lead to corruption. If the press is not allowed to publish stories that are harmful to the country, the press could lose their credibility. It is also important to have a free press in order to protect human rights. It is important to have a free press in order to protect freedom of speech. If the press is not allowed to publish stories that are harmful to the country, this could lead to a lack of trust from the citizens. This could also lead to a lack of transparency from the government. The citizens should be able to hold the government accountable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should not allow the press to publish stories that are harmful to the country. The press has an obligation to hold the government to account, but this does not mean that the press should be allowed to publish stories that are harmful to the country. If there are stories that will be harmful to our country, the government should not allow them to be published. These could cause danger and harm to individuals and all citizens of our country, and this should be prevented at all costs. The safety of the people in our country is priority and should be safeguarded at all costs no matter how serious the story!
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the press should be allowed to publish stories that are harmful to the country. The press has an obligation to hold the government to account. By blocking negative/harmful stories from being published is morally wrong. The citizens of any country have a right to know what's going on with no impartiality. Once truth is removed from the press, stories will be published to serve an agenda for those with an active interest. The press should be independent & not owned or accountable to any government.
