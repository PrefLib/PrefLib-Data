# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is no right answer about whether it is okay to eat meat or not. However, we believe that the way meat is currently produced and consumed is unsustainable and inhumane and that there needs to be a change. In particular, it is important that we should be moving away from factory farmed meat, where animals are kept in inhumane conditions. This can be done by choosing to buy organic, free-range meat from small, local farms and by choosing to eat more vegetarian or vegan meals, even if it is only once a week.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final consensus statement: We recognise that the science of nutrition is an extremely complex one and that some people may not be able to have a plant-based diet due to health reasons. As a society, we should be doing more to tackle the treatment of animals, and to opt for a less meat-reliant diet. More information about farm animal welfare should be provided to consumers in order to help them to make informed choices. We also recognise that the sustainable farming of meat to a high welfare standard remains an extremely difficult problem to overcome due to the ever-increasing demand for meat, but ultimately all of us, regardless of our dietary choices, have a part to play in shaping the way forward.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While the science of nutrition is an extremely complex one and we recognise that some people may not be able to have a plant-based diet due to health reasons, we believe that as a society, we should be trying to eat less meat. In particular, it is important that we should be moving away from factory farmed meat, where animals are kept in inhumane conditions. This can be done by choosing to buy organic, free-range meat from small, local farms and by choosing to eat more vegetarian or vegan meals, even if it is only once a week. We also recognise that the availability of lab grown meat in the future may play an important role in reducing the global demand for meat, as this will allow meat to be consumed without the need to slaughter animals.
