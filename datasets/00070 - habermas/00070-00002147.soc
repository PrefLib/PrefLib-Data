# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We think that critical thinking should be taught in school. It helps students to be able to think for themselves and not just accept everything that they are told, which is extremely important in life. Critical thinking can be used in everyday life and is a valuable skill to have. It can be used in situations when making decisions as well as evaluating people’s arguments and justifying your opinions. Therefore, if critical thinking is taught in school it will give students the opportunity to understand how to analyse information and arguments before making a decision and will help them to develop their critical thinking skills.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of students being taught critical thinking in school.  The group felt that it is important for students to be taught to consider all points of view on any particular subject and to question things when appropriate.  They should not just be influenced by one side, as in only Left Wing ideas and not hearing more centralised or Right Wing views.  It is important for students to be able to think outside the box and see things in different ways.  The group felt that it is important for students to be able to make informed decisions with the information and research before them.  The group felt that it is important for students to question everything and not just accept things as they are.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is absolutely vital for students to be taught critical thinking in school, in order to enable them to make informed decisions and think outside the box in the real world. They will also gain a broader perspective on certain situations that would otherwise not be possible if they had not been taught to think critically.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Students should be taught critical thinking in school. It is important for students to be able to think for themselves and to have their own opinions. They should be encouraged to question things and to have their own ideas. It is also important to be able to think critically when making decisions, and to consider all the options and possible outcomes.
