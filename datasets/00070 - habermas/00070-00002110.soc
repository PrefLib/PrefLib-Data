# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Sex education in schools is important in todays society, and in many ways is vital for child well-being and developing their understanding of life. We believe that sex education is good in schools as it gives children information which they may not be taught elsewhere, and gives them the right information, avoiding the risk of them developing knowledge of how their bodies work from friends or the internet. Sex education in schools also makes sure that everyone is learning the same things, which can be beneficial in developing a child's knowledge and understanding. Some people may question the age-appropriateness of sex education, but we believe that even the younger ages should be exposed to it, so that they know how their bodies work and how to deal with changes and can later go on to learn the topics which require more serious information. We believe that topics such as STI's and consent are important for older children to be taught about, and can give children the tools to make informed decisions. There is also a risk of teenage pregnancies if sex education is not taught in schools, and children can go on to develop their sexual knowledge without appropriate information to know how to stay safe.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, we believe that every school should have an age-appropriate sex education program. Sex education is important for children to be informed about, and understand how their bodies work and how they can deal with different situations. It also ensures they are well educated about the dangers of unprotected sex, and know how to stay safe. They can also be taught about consent, and understanding other people's feelings. We feel that it is important to include sex education in schools as there may be children who have no other way to find out information on this topic, and so they may learn bad information from the internet and friends. The topics covered should be age appropriate, so for younger children it would be limited, and for older children they could be taught about STI's and consent.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Sex education should be introduced at a young age to children to ensure that they know how their bodies work, how to stay safe and how to look after themselves. It is important to include sex education in schools as there may be children who have no other way to find out information on this topic, and so they may learn bad information from the internet and friends. The topics covered should be age appropriate, so for younger children it would be limited, and for older children they could be taught about STI's and consent. It is important that they know about consent and how to protect themselves from diseases. The sex education should be taught in a safe environment, which is age appropriate, where children can feel comfortable asking questions. It is important to include the parents in this so that the children are also getting the information at home as well as at school, and so that parents feel comfortable with the information that their children are learning.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, we believe that every school should have an age-appropriate sex education program. Sex education is important for children to be informed about, and understand how their bodies work and how they can deal with different situations. It also ensures they are well educated about the dangers of unprotected sex, and know how to stay safe. They can also be taught about consent, and understanding other people's feelings.
