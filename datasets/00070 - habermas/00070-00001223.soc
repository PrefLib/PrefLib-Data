# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People who are eligible for organ transplants should not be given priority based on their social impact. The allocation of organ transplants should be based on objective criteria such as how long a patient will live without the transplant. The principle of autonomy of individuals requires that all people should be treated equally regardless of the type of life they lead or their socioeconomic status. This prevents the development of an unequal society. It is ethically unjustifiable to base organ allocation on a person’s contribution to society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, the social impact of a person should not be a factor in organ transplant allocation. Every human life has equal value and should be treated as such. The social impact of a person is not something that they can control and is not something that is easily defined. Therefore, it is not something that should be used to determine who is more deserving of an organ transplant.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, people who are eligible for organ transplants should not be given priority based on their social impact. The fundamental principle of equality should be upheld and everyone should be treated the same. However, it is acknowledged that there are certain circumstances in which the social impact of an individual could be taken into consideration. For example, if a person has made a significant contribution to society and is the only person who is able to continue this work, it would be reasonable to give them priority for an organ transplant.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People who are eligible for organ transplants should not be given priority based on their social impact. The allocation of organ transplants should be based on objective criteria such as how long a patient is expected to live if he or she receives an organ, and the urgency of their need.
