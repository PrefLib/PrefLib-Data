# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should move to a different system of democratic voting. The current system is not working effectively and is not allowing for a true democratic process. The current system is also not allowing for the political change that is needed. The current system also favours the establishment and makes it difficult to have political change. We should move to a system of proportional representation to ensure that the vote cast by every member of the public counts and will have a direct impact on the share of seats that each party gets. This is fairer and accurately represents the will of the British people as a whole. It would also encourage people to vote as they would know that their vote is not being wasted if, for example, they were in a seat that was traditionally dominated by one particular political party.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the current system of voting in the UK is not working effectively. It does not allow for a true democratic process and does not reflect the will of the people. It favours the two main political parties and makes it difficult for other political parties to gain power. The current system does not allow for political change and this is holding the UK's democracy back. However, it is difficult to say whether we should move to a different system of democratic voting without knowing what other mechanism is being proposed. The current system has some advantages and it is not clear that a different system would be better.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the current system of voting is not working effectively and should be changed. The current system favours the establishment and makes it difficult to have political change. It is extremely difficult for a different political party to gain power with the current system and this is holding the UK's democracy back. We should move to a different system of democratic voting, such as proportional representation, to ensure that the vote cast by every member of the public counts and will have a direct impact on the share of seats that each party gets. This is fairer and accurately represents the will of the British people as a whole. It would also encourage people to vote as they would know that their vote is not being wasted if, for example, they were in a seat that was traditionally dominated by one particular political party.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the current system of voting in the UK is not working effectively. There is a need to move to a different system of democratic voting. We think that the current system favours the establishment and makes it difficult to have political change. We do not think the current system allows for a true democratic process and protects the two main political parties, in particular, the Conservatives. It is extremely difficult for a different political party to gain power with the current system and we think that is holding the UK's democracy back. We think that proportional representation would be a fairer system that would allow the votes of the British people to be accurately represented in the share of seats that each party gets. This would encourage people to vote as they would know that their vote is not being wasted if, for example, they were in a seat that was traditionally dominated by one particular political party.
