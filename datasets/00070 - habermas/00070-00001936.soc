# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, we need to spend more on prevention. Prevention, rather than punitive approaches, has been shown to be the most effective way of dealing with drug use. This is because, as drug users are stigmatised, their access to support services and programs that may be able to help them to overcome their addiction is limited. For example, people in recovery from drug use have difficulty in getting jobs, and drug use is not accepted as a mitigating factor for any other crimes. Prevention would ensure that less people enter the criminal justice system, and would result in less drug use overall, meaning that more people would be able to lead healthy and happy lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: A consensus statement from the participants:
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that more funds should be allocated to prevent drug use. We believe that drug use is a huge problem and addiction can ruin lives. We believe that all drug use is bad, and that people can use drugs safely and responsibly. We believe that when drug use starts to negatively affect parts of your life such as your job, mental health, physical health, relationships etc. then it becomes a problem. We believe that the sale of drugs also funds other criminal behaviour. We believe that we currently give enough support to drug users. We believe that investing in programs that prevent drug use, provide rehabilitation and support programs makes absolute sense in a society that can clearly see the detrimental effects of drug use. We believe that drug addiction has far reaching effects, not only for the addict but their families and wider society there for it makes sense to put more money into proving lonng lastinng solutions. We believe that in the ongoing war on drugs we do believe that there should be more funds allocated to prevent drug use. We believe that the associated crime that is occuring in out society due to drug use is escalating and needs to be stopped. We believe that a crackdown on drug use would result on less crime on our streets. We believe that
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group of participants were split on this question. The participants who believed that more funds should be allocated to prevent drug use believed that this would reduce crime and make the streets safer. The participants who did not believe that more funds should be allocated to prevent drug use believed that the current methods are not working and that the government should be looking at other ways to prevent drug use.
