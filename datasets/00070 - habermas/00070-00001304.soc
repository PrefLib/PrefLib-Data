# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not okay to use personal data to make inferences about people's character and personality. Using personal data to make such inferences is an invasion of privacy. If a person is suspected of a crime and there is sufficient evidence, then it may be justified.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, it is not okay to use personal data to make inferences about people's character and personality. This is because using personal data to make inferences about people's character and personality is an invasion of privacy. People should be able to keep their personal data private, and if they wish to share it, they should have the option to choose who they share it with. However, in some circumstances, it may be justified to use personal data to make inferences about people's character and personality. This is because if a person is suspected of a crime, it may be necessary to use personal data to make inferences about their character and personality. This is because it may be necessary to use personal data to determine whether a person is guilty or innocent.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, it is not okay to use personal data to make inferences about people's character and personality. Personal data should be private and confidential. If people want to share their personal data, they should have the option to do so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - While personal data can be used to make inferences about someone's character, it is not okay to use that information to make assumptions about someone's character and personality. As participants pointed out, making assumptions based off of personal data is not fair or accurate, as people's personalities are often more complex than the information their data represents. Also, some personal data is private, and so using it is an invasion of privacy and an abuse of power.
