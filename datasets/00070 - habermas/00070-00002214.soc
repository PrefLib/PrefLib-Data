# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of making private medical insurance compulsory. The reasons for this included the fact that the NHS is a publicly funded service which should be available to all and that private medical insurance would create a two-tier system where the rich would receive better treatment than the poor. The group was also concerned that making private medical insurance compulsory would lead to the NHS being further underfunded and would lead to a decline in the quality of care. It is also the case that the NHS has come under increased pressure during the Covid-19 pandemic, underlining the need for it to receive the resources it needs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Private medical insurance should not be made compulsory for anyone. The NHS is publicly funded and should be able to cater to all of the needs of the UK population. If people choose to get private medical insurance, this should be treated as an optional extra.
