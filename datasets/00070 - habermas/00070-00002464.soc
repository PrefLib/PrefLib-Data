# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of capping footballers' wages, although they did not all agree with the idea of capping the Prime Minister's salary. The group thought that the footballers were overpaid and that the money could be used more effectively elsewhere in society. However, they also agreed that footballers bring in a lot of money to the country through tourism and that they deserve to be paid for their hard work and dedication. The group came to the consensus view that footballers' wages should be capped, but not the Prime Minister's salary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of a maximum wage for footballers. While some people in the group felt that footballers should not earn more than the Prime Minister, the group as a whole felt that this was not a good way to approach the issue. The group felt that it was more important to ensure that people in society were not being left behind, and that a gap in income was not corrosive to societal cohesion. In particular, the group agreed that it was important to address the issue of people being left behind in society, and agreed that the best way to do this was to ensure that people had enough to live on.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of a maximum wage. The group felt that imposing such a cap would be counterproductive, as it would stifle competition and incentive. There was also a concern that a maximum wage would lead to a brain drain, where the best footballers would be tempted to play abroad, where they are paid more. However, the group also recognised that the current footballing system is not perfect and that footballers are paid too much. The group felt that something should be done to improve the system, but that it should not be a maximum wage.

The group also felt that the focus should be on whether people are being left behind, not on dragging others back.
