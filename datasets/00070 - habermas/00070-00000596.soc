# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “In general, we think that it is not a good idea to make voting compulsory. The current system where people are encouraged to vote but not forced to is the best approach. This is because we believe that people should be able to make their own decisions about whether or not to vote. Forcing people to vote will not make them more engaged in politics. Instead, politicians should engage the public in debate and through this encourage people to vote.”
