# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In the case of a pandemic, social distancing is a very effective measure to prevent the spread of the disease and to protect the most vulnerable in society. The police should be able to enforce social distancing in order to protect the public health. This is especially true in the case of a deadly disease. However, the police should not be given too much power in this regard. There should be a balance between the needs of the police to enforce social distancing and the needs of the individual to maintain their personal freedom. The police should not be able to use excessive force to enforce social distancing and there should be oversight of their actions in this regard. The police should also be careful to ensure that their actions are proportionate and that they do not infringe on the rights of the individual in any way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In the event of a pandemic, the police should be able to enforce a “social distancing” mandate. This is to ensure that the most vulnerable in society are protected and to reduce the spread of the disease. The police should be able to enforce this mandate in a proportionate manner, taking into account the personal circumstances of the individuals involved. This is to ensure that the police do not overstep the mark and cause unnecessary distress to individuals. The police should also be able to enforce this mandate in a fair manner, ensuring that it is applied equally to all individuals. This is to ensure that the police are not seen to be showing favouritism to certain individuals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: During a pandemic, the police should be able to enforce a social distancing mandate. This is because during a pandemic, it is essential to protect the health of the population. It is also important to ensure that the health service is not overwhelmed, as this would lead to a higher mortality rate. It is also important to ensure that the economy is not damaged by a pandemic, as this would lead to a higher rate of unemployment, and would also lead to a lower tax revenue, which would lead to less money being available for the NHS and other public services. However, it is also important to ensure that the police do not use their powers in an excessive way. For example, the police should not be stopping people who are walking their dog, or who are going for a run, as this is not a breach of social distancing rules. The police should also not use their powers to stop people from seeing their friends and family, unless it is a large gathering.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In the face of a pandemic, the government has a duty to protect its citizens and the police have a duty to enforce laws. In order to do so, the government can make laws and the police can enforce them. This is especially the case when the pandemic is very serious and when it is very contagious. However, the laws should be proportionate to the threat and the police should not be used in a heavy handed way. The police should not be used to stop people going about their daily business and they should not be used to stop people from seeing their friends and family. The police should only be used to stop people from breaking the law and they should only be used to stop people from breaking the law when it is clear that they are doing so. The police should not be used to stop people from doing things that are not against the law, even if it is not advisable to do those things.
