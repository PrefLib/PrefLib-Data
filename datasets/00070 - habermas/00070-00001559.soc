# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children under the age of 13 do not benefit from being allowed to have their own Instagram account. The content available on Instagram these days is highly inappropriate for children under the age of 13. Whilst there are wholesome videos out there, there are also highly sexualised content, too. There are risky behaviours displayed, and absolutely idiotic dares presented as "challenges". The recent case of the little boy from UK, Archie, who saw a challenge on social media and tried to do it, and sadly, he died as he hung himself. A lot of the blame lays firmly at the foot of this harmful content, which can influence youngsters and encourage them to emulate the behaviour they see online. All the likes and the shares provide a false sense of "popularity" and not to mention, all the hostile comments can cause intense mental harm. There is no additional benefit to a 12 year old or younger to have an Instagram account. They can socialise in other ways, in real life. In conclusion, no, they do not benefit from it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children under the age of 13 do not benefit from being allowed to have their own Instagram account.  There is a lot of content on Instagram which is inappropriate for young children to see, and which can have a harmful effect on them.  Children can socialise in other ways in real life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, children under the age of 13 do not benefit from being allowed to have their own Instagram account. Social media has a lot of negative impact on the mental health of children. Children under the age of 13 are too young to be exposed to such mental trauma, as they cannot distinguish the real from the fake. In our opinion, the government and social media platforms need to take steps to make it illegal for children under the age of 13 to have their own social media accounts. The influence of social media can cause serious harm to their mental health and overall development. We believe that young children need to be shielded from the darker side of the world, so that they can grow up without having to be exposed to negativity and anxiety.
