# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Petrol is a contentious issue in today’s world, with its fluctuating costs and environmental impact. However, increasing taxes is not the solution. Due to the significant impact on the cost of living, increasing taxes on petrol is not a viable option. Whilst it may encourage a more efficient use of oil, it does not address the damage already done to the environment by this. In the short term, raising taxes is not the solution. However, the current system does not incentivise sustainable transport solutions and needs to be updated in order to allow our public transport system to be as efficient as possible. In the long term, an overhaul of the tax system and public transport system is needed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should not increase taxes on petrol as this would have a detrimental effect on the cost of living. Instead, taxes on petrol should be lowered to a reasonable level and the tax system should be overhauled in order to incentivise the use of sustainable forms of transport and discourage the use of cars. This will be better for the environment in the long run.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although there is a need to overhaul the current tax system and introduce a better public transport network, at this time a change in tax rate would not be the right solution due to the detrimental impact it would have on the cost of living in Ireland.
