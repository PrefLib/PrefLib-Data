# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The BBC should be funded by tax-payer money, but the way it is funded should be reviewed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The BBC should be funded by tax payers, as it is a publically funded channel and is meant to be neutral.  However, the TV license is an outdated method of funding.  The BBC should be funded by a method similar to that of the BBC Iplayer.  This is a more up to date method and therefore would be more beneficial for all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, the BBC should not be funded by the tax-payer.  Not everyone watches the BBC.  Therefore, why should you pay for something you don't use?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the BBC should not be funded by the tax-payer.  The BBC is a very large organisation, and has many different functions.  Some of these functions, such as providing a news service, should be funded by the tax-payer, as it is important for democracy that there is a neutral news service that can report on political issues.  However, other functions of the BBC, such as entertainment programmes, should not be funded by the tax-payer, as this is not in the public interest.
