# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK does have a moral duty to admit more refugees, however, the UK is not well-equipped to handle them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should admit more refugees. However, there are genuine refugees and economic migrants and it is proving very difficult to distinguish between the two.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should continue to be a refuge for genuine refugees, but we have the right to return people to their country if we believe that is in their best long term interests.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK does have a moral duty to accept refugees as some of these refugees are displaced due to war in their countries. However, the government needs to be selective on the types of refugees they accept. For instance, some refugees may be victims of war, but they also may be war criminals. These types of refugees should be denied access to the UK.
