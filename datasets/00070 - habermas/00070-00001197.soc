# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the UK does not need its own military. However, with the current state of affairs in the world, it is imperative that the UK maintains a military force. The UK is currently in a position of relative safety, and without its own military it would be vulnerable to attack. There is a necessity to defend this nation from threats, such as Russia. Unless we form a pan European army or a dedicated NATO army, them it is incumbent upon us to have our own armed forces capable of defending this nation or assisting in times of domestic or environmental crisis. Having no defensive ability would allow non favourable regimes to bully us as a nation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The United Kingdom needs its own military. This is because there are external forces that would remain threat to the country. Aside the local threats, there are threats from other countries that believes other developed countries are threat. Such as Russia, North Korea etc. As a result of the external threats, the United Kingdom still need its own military everyday for protection. Participants views are underpinned by their theoretical knowledge of Social Constructionism, which supports the view that humans construct social reality by the meanings that we attach to objects. Social constructionism explains that, in this case, the need for a military is socially constructed. Participants views that the UK needs its own military because it is seen as a threat by other countries such as Russia. This could be a consequence of the UK being part of NATO. The reality that Russia is a threat to the UK is constructed by the meanings we attach to this relationship. Participants stated that Russia is a threat to the UK because of their behaviour in Ukraine. However, participants didn't take into consideration that the UK is also seen as a threat by Russia. If we didn't have a military, we wouldn't have the ability to be seen as a threat to Russia.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The United Kingdom still needs its own military. The military is necessary to protect the United Kingdom from foreign threats and to provide support in times of domestic crisis. The United Kingdom is currently vulnerable to foreign threats, and as it has recently left the EU, it is now more important than ever to have its own military. The United Kingdom is also vulnerable to domestic threats, such as terrorist attacks. The United Kingdom's military is also needed to provide support in times of crisis, such as flooding. The United Kingdom's military is also needed to provide support in times of crisis, such as flooding.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The United Kingdom needs its own military. The United Kingdom military needs to have the funding to be able to successfully protect its citizens. To ensure this, the UK military needs to be fully equipped with all the necessary equipment to carry out their duties. The United Kingdom military also needs to ensure that they are prepared for the ever changing world we live in. This means that the military needs to be able to be able to work in conjunction with other military forces, in order to ensure the safety of the UK. The UK military should also be prepared to be able to deal with domestic issues, should they arise.
