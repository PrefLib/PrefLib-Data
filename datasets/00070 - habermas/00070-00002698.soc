# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: National pride can be a very good thing. It can help to give people a sense of belonging and pride in their country. It can also be a very dangerous thing if people start to believe their country is better than others. As such, we should not be actively promoting national pride, but rather, we should be promoting being a good global citizen. We should also be teaching about the history of the UK in school, so that people can be proud of their country, but also understand its history and the mistakes that have been made.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We don't think that it is necessary to actively promote national pride. However, it is important to ensure that the next generation are taught about the history of the UK and how it has shaped the world. This will naturally lead to a sense of pride and belonging. We should also ensure that we celebrate the positive aspects of the UK and ensure that it is not always portrayed in a negative light. We should be proud of the UK, but this should not come at the expense of other nations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: National pride is a double edged sword. There is a fine line between pride and arrogance. The UK is not perfect, however we have shaped the world in a positive way and we should be proud of this. We should be teaching the next generation about this, so they can be proud of where they come from and understand their role in shaping the future. We should also be teaching them to be accepting of other cultures and beliefs. We should be teaching them to be proud global citizens.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of promoting a greater degree of national pride. However, it was recognised that this could be problematic if it led to a sense of superiority and a lack of appreciation for other cultures. It was felt that the best way to promote national pride was to ensure that the history of the UK was taught in schools, and that this should be done in a way that celebrated the UK's achievements but also acknowledged its failures. It was felt that this would help to instil a sense of pride in the nation's history and culture, and also to help people understand that the UK is not perfect and that it has made mistakes in the past. The group felt that this would help to ensure that any sense of national pride would not be used as a way of making the UK feel superior to other nations.
