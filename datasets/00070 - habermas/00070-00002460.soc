# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We feel that bullying can be reduced in schools but not completely eradicated. Children are still growing and learning about the world. They will make mistakes and be unkind to each other at times. However, we feel that a lot of bullying can be prevented by creating a culture of inclusion in schools. Teachers and pupils need to be educated about bullying and the impact it can have on a person. There needs to be a system in place where pupils can report bullying anonymously and be confident that it will be dealt with. If pupils know that they can speak up about bullying without fear of repercussions then this will help to reduce bullying in schools. It is also important to educate pupils on why people bully. It is often a case of insecurity and a need to feel superior. If pupils understand this then they will be less likely to bully and more likely to stand up for a pupil who is being bullied.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We feel it is not possible to completely eliminate bullying in schools as bullying can occur in many different ways, both physically and mentally, and it can occur anywhere. Although we feel it is not possible to completely eliminate bullying, we feel it is possible to reduce bullying in schools.  This can be done by having an anti-bullying policy which is implemented and followed by all staff and pupils in the school. We feel that it is also important to educate pupils on what bullying is and how it can affect someone.  Having a reporting system in place is also important as this allows students to report bullying if it is happening to them or if they have witnessed it. We feel that if these steps are implemented, bullying can be reduced in schools but it is not possible to completely eliminate it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Bullying in schools is an ongoing and serious problem which can be reduced, but not completely eradicated. It is difficult to get rid of bullying in schools because children will be children, and their behavior is influenced by their upbringing and the culture they are exposed to. It is also difficult to monitor children all the time, and some bullying will inevitably happen when they are out of sight. This can be reduced slightly by implementing a reporting system where students can anonymously report bullying, but it is difficult to eradicate completely because children can be quite mean and it takes time for them to learn to act morally. It is possible to get rid of bullying in schools to a certain extent by creating a culture which values inclusivity and by educating students on the topic, as well as by creating an environment where pupils feel safe to speak up. However, bullying is a part of human nature and it is difficult to eradicate all bullying behavior.
