# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, the media has a responsibility to report things accurately, however this is easier said than done as there are no "facts" only "perceptions of fact". So, the media has a responsibility to accurately report the facts they have and they should not report as fact that which they do not know to be true. It is also important that when reporting a story, that both sides of the story are reported, not just the "facts" that support the story. If it is suspected that the story is not accurate, the reasons for believing the story to be accurate or inaccurate should be reported. On the other hand, they are entitled to their opinions. It is not the job of the media to manipulate people, but rather to accurately report the facts they know.
