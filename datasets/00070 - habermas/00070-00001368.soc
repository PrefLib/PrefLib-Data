# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People with anti-social behaviour should attend classes that help them integrate in the society, where they learn how to respect other people. If they are showing the same behaviour multiple times and in most of their interactions with other people, their ability to live where they want should be restricted to areas where people with similar behavioural issues live. I believe that getting fined for any rules they are breaking may also help stopping this behaviour. The police should also do talks in schools to pupils to warn them of consequences and what a life of anti social behaviour could lead to. These villages and towns could invest in areas for kids to hang out in where they can socialise, giving them something to do that isn't vandalising etc. Anti social behaviour should be strongly punished . Fines & deterrents put in place ,  Bans from public places if the behaviour is in social settings eg football match, shopping centres Curfews put in place   If this related to children the sanctions should be placed on the parents .
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While anti-social behaviour is a matter of opinion, we as a society have to accept the need to deal with it. Therefore, our belief is that there should be strong deterrents in place for anti-social behaviour. We believe that these deterrents should include consequences such as community service and fines, as well as punishment. We believe that the police should be doing regular patrols, as well as giving talks to children and teenagers about anti-social behaviour. We also believe that it would be useful to have certain areas where young people can socialise and take part in sports and other activities that would keep them occupied. We believe that education is the key to stopping anti-social behaviour. This is because, while deterrents are important, they do not solve the problem. However, education will stop anti-social behaviour from ever happening, which would be the ideal outcome.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Anti-social behaviour is a very wide ranging topic and there is no one way to solve it. The severity of the problem and the way to solve it depends on the area, and in some cases the people involved. For the most part however, there is a lack of consequences for anti-social behaviour and this needs to be addressed. This can be done in a number of ways. Firstly, there needs to be a greater police presence in areas where anti-social behaviour is a problem. This will act as a deterrent to those who may be considering engaging in anti-social behaviour. Secondly, there needs to be more severe punishments for those who do engage in anti-social behaviour. This can include community service, fines, or even prison sentences. Lastly, there needs to be more done to help those who are engaging in anti-social behaviour. This can include classes to help them integrate into society, and in some cases, restricting where they live to areas where people with similar behavioural issues live. This is to ensure that they are not a danger to the public and to prevent them from influencing others to engage in anti-social behaviour.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People who have a behaviour that prevents others from living their lives and limits them in any way should be given a chance to change. If they are willing to change, they should attend classes that teach them how to change. If they are not willing to change, they should not be able to live in the same areas as people who are willing to live by the society’s rules. Fines should be introduced as a punishment for their actions.
