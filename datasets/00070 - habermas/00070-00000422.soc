# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the tax on sugary drinks should be increased to reduce obesity. We are currently faced with a ticking time bomb in the NHS caused by obesity. Eating and drinking habits which lead to obesity often start at a very young age and this often starts with sugary snacks and drinks. By increasing the tax on sugary drinks we may manage to prevent people from adopting such habits. Even if this doesn't happen, the extra money raised could be used by the NHS to cover the costs of the growing number of obesity related illnesses that cost so much to treat
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should be free to consume whatever they want. The health consequences of obesity are mostly personal and as long as the person can afford the cost of treatment for any health problems which arise, there is no need to change what we do
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should increase the tax on sugary drinks. However, this should be paired with a programme that will help educate people about healthy eating and provide alternatives that are more nutritious. We should also provide support for people who have an addiction to sugar, to help them reduce their intake.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should be free to consume whatever they want, but in the interest of protecting the NHS, it is fair to ask them to contribute a little more if they want to do so. The increase should be minimal, however, so that poorer families are not unfairly affected.
