# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The minimum wage should be set for every worker regardless of age. The idea that younger people earn less than an older person for doing exactly the same job doesn't rest easy with me. I can't see a good argument about why young people should be paid less than older people for the same job. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes. It is a human right to earn the same amount of money, for the same unit of work, as others doing the same job. The argument that younger people do not have as many bills does not hold sway. Some people live independently at 16, whilst others still live with their parents into their 40's and onwards. Companies should not be able to take advantage of cheap labour, by employing people they can pay less. The economy also benefits from more income earned in terms of taxation etc. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Introducing a higher minimum wage for workers under 18 is a step towards economic justice. Young workers often have the same living expenses and financial responsibilities as their older counterparts. They do the same job as someone who is older, so they should should be paid the same. It will also encourage more young individuals to enter the workforce, boosting overall employment and the economy. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - yes because it would give them an incentive to want to progress in the workplace and help them move out of home. it should still be low enough tho so that they aspire for promotion
