# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Equal value should be placed on teaching of history of our nation and other nations. While it is good to know our own history, this shouldn't be the only history that is taught. We can learn from other nation's histories and expand our view on the world, as it is fascinating to know about the successes and struggles of other cultures and also helps us to empathise with other nations. As humans we must be kind to one another for us all to live peacefully and we can learn most from history. It is also important to know about our own history and traditions so we can keep them alive, and if we learn about both we have more enriched lives with more varied cultures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, the emphasis should not be placed on teaching the history and values of the nation, as opposed to the history and values of other nations. The history and values of other nations is just as important to know about. It is important to know about our own history and values, but it is also important to know about the history and values of other nations, so that we can all understand each other better.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is important to learn about the history and values of your own nation, but you should also be taught about the history and values of other nations so that you are able to learn about other cultures and empathise with other nations. This will enable you to have a more diverse and well rounded education, and also learn from the past.
