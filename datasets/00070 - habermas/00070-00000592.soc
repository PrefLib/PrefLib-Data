There was some opposition to the idea, citing the potential for inefficiency in government and the additional cost of more civil servants. However, the group in general thought that the government would be able to manage the sector better than private companies, who are only interested in profit.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “Renationalising the electricity network is a good idea. The private companies are making huge profits from the public.

In this way we can break the cartel made by those greedy private owners.”
