# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We think that the government should regulate the amount of sugar that can be put into any soft drink sold in the UK. This is because the health of the population is important and sugary drinks are a factor that contributes to poor health. The cost of obesity to the NHS is £6billion per year and if it can be reduced by reducing the amount of sugar in drinks then it would benefit the population as a whole. If the government regulated the amount of sugar that can be put into drinks it would also send a message that it is important for the population to live healthier lifestyles and make better choices for their health.

The cost of obesity to the NHS is £6billion per year and if it can be reduced by reducing the amount of sugar in drinks then it would benefit the population as a whole. This is because the obesity rate in the UK is one of the highest in the world and soft drinks are a big contributor to this. We believe this is an issue that needs to be addressed and the government has the power to do this. We know that some people will say that this will have a negative impact on soft drink companies and the economy but the economy is dependent on a healthy population and the cost of treating obesity and related health issues is huge.

This is because people would be able to enjoy their drinks without the amount of sugar that can cause health problems and because they would be better off in the long run by not having to pay for obesity treatments.
