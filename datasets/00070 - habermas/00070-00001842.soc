# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of having a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups. It was felt that this would be a good way to celebrate the achievements of these groups and to highlight the fact that they have been historically under-represented. It was also felt that this would be a good way to educate the wider public on the achievements of these groups and to help people understand the struggles that they have faced. The only concern that was raised was that this could be used as an excuse for people to take a day off work and not actually engage with the issues at hand. However, it was felt that this could be overcome by having events and activities on the day to help educate people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No. We don't need more public holidays.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should definitely have a separate public holiday to mark the contributions of historically marginalised groups.  We believe that historically marginalised groups have contributed to society and should be recognised for their achievements and what they went through. The consensus statement also highlighted that having a holiday to commemorate historically marginalised groups would make more people aware of what happened and the hardships these groups went through. It would also give more people the opportunity to learn about these groups, and more people would be aware of the achievements and the struggles of these groups. The consensus statement also outlined that having a holiday would bring communities together and would help people celebrate the achievements of these groups and help people be more aware of the hardships that these groups went through. The consensus statement also outlined that the holiday would also provide people with the opportunity to be more involved and educate themselves on the history of these groups and the hardships that these groups went through.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a public holiday to mark the contribution of historically marginalised groups.
