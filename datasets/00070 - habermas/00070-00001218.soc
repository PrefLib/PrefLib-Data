# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Both are equally important priorities. Alcoholism and drug use are serious problems that need to be tackled. Both can have serious health consequences and both can lead to an increase in crime. The best way to tackle this would be to provide more education to young people and the wider public about the dangers of alcoholism and drug use. This would hopefully lead to a reduction in alcoholism and drug use and would hopefully lead to a reduction in crime. However, it would be very difficult to say which is the more important priority. Alcoholism and drug use are very different problems that need to be tackled in different ways. Therefore, it would be very difficult to say which is the more important priority. Both are very important priorities. We all agree that more research needs to be done in this area before a final decision can be made on which is the more important priority.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Both are equally important priorities. Alcoholism and drug use are serious problems that need to be tackled. Both can have serious health consequences and both can lead to an increase in crime. The best way to tackle this would be to provide more education to young people and the wider public about the dangers of alcoholism and drug use. This would hopefully lead to a reduction in alcoholism and drug use and would hopefully lead to a reduction in crime. However, it would be very difficult to say which is the more important priority. Alcoholism and drug use are very different problems that need to be tackled in different ways. Therefore, it would be very difficult to say which is the more important priority. Both are very important priorities. However, I would have to say that alcoholism is the more important priority. This is because alcoholism is more common and therefore any effort would mean that a greater number of people would benefit from reduction programmes. Also, alcoholism leads to much more severe health consequences than drug use.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “Both are equally important priorities. Alcoholism and drug use are serious problems that need to be tackled. Both can have serious health consequences and both can lead to an increase in crime. The best way to tackle this would be to provide more education to young people and the wider public about the dangers of alcoholism and drug use. This would hopefully lead to a reduction in alcoholism and drug use and would hopefully lead to a reduction in crime. It is very difficult to say which is the more important priority. Alcoholism and drug use are very different problems that need to be tackled in different ways. Therefore, it is difficult to say which is the more important priority. Both are very important priorities.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Final consensus statement: “Both are very important priorities. Alcoholism and drug use are serious problems that need to be tackled. Both can have serious health consequences and both can lead to an increase in crime. The best way to tackle this would be to provide more education to young people and the wider public about the dangers of alcoholism and drug use. This would hopefully lead to a reduction in alcoholism and drug use and would hopefully lead to a reduction in crime. Both are very important priorities. We would like to know what other participants think.” Task 3: Second referendum question, completed by a large number of participants Option 1: Options 2 and 3 are more important priorities than option 1 Option 2: Option 3 is a more important priority than option 2. Option 3: Option 2 is a more important priority than option 3. This project was designed to elicit critical views about this project from participants, so it will be of interest to receive further feedback on any aspect of the project from participants, including the participants themselves and the various questions asked during the project, either by email or by commenting below.
