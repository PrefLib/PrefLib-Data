# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children should be educated at school as it is difficult to replicate a school environment at home, especially for children who would find it hard to concentrate in an unstructured environment.  School is also a place where children can learn to interact with others, it helps them become more social, and teaches them about the world they live in.  They also learn skills that they will use later in life, such as working as a team, taking turns, and negotiating.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Home schooling can be effective in certain situations, however for the majority of children we believe that traditional schooling is more beneficial. This is because traditional schooling provides a variety of learning styles that cater to different types of learners, where as home schooling would limit the child to one learning style. Traditional schooling also allows the children to interact with their peers, and build up relationships and social skills, which is important when entering the work force. There are however exceptions to this. We believe that home schooling can be effective in certain situations, such as if a child has special needs and is being home schooled by a teacher, or if a child is particularly interested in a certain subject and the home schooling allows them to pursue that passion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should be educated at school as it is the best way to learn. It is important to learn in a structured environment, to meet and interact with other children and adults. The social aspect of school is important to help develop communication and social skills.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the decision that children should not be educated at home. We believe that they learn better in a structured school environment along with having the authority to follow and rules to adhere too. Whilst in school they are also interacting with other children and adults therefore developing their social skills. We believe that homeschooling is limited to the parent/s' knowledge and interpretation of issues. Whilst it allows children to explore certain topics that interest them in greater depth, at some point they will most likely have to enter mainstream education and will be underprepared for this experience. We believe that the majority of children today would prefer being educated from school. This also ensure they get to learn more than what is in exams etc, they will get to learn social and communication skills which are extremely important when they go into the working world etc. So overall we believe most kids should be educated at school and home education should be used as a back-up/secondary option.
