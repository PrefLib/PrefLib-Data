# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the idea of being able to predict crime is a good idea. However, this should be tested to make sure it is not biased, particularly towards ethnic minorities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, public authorities should not use big data to predict which people are likely to commit crimes. The idea of using big data to predict crime is a good idea but there is no way of knowing how accurate the data is and it is likely to lead to many false accusations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “The idea of using big data to predict crimes is good. This should be tested to make sure it is not biased, particularly towards ethnic minorities. The public should feel safe with their data and the public authorities should not use big data for any other purposes than preventing crimes and predicting which people are likely to commit them.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “We feel that the use of big data to predict crime is a good idea in theory but we are concerned about how it will be used in practice. It could be a useful tool to prevent crime but it could also be a very dangerous tool if used in the wrong way.”
