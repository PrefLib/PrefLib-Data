# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think the UK should have a system for selecting the monarch, it doesn't really have an old system so it can't be classed as a new system.  I don't really think that a hereditary monarch has a place in today's society, it is too antiquated and classist, if we really need a head of state it shouldn't be a hereditary appointment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I think the system in place works fine as it is. It is good to hold onto some traditions even if they do not fit in with the modern world. It ground the country and shows where we came from and is a important piece of history. It is an even we can all unite around.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No there shouldn't be a new system as the monarchy is a deeply ingrained part of the UK. Many British people are proud of the monarchy and that pride holds people together. Either abolish it or continue with the current system and tradition.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I believe that the UK should not have a monarchy at all. The monarchy does not benefit us at all, and instead costs a lot of money which could be better spent elsewhere. People argue that keeping the monarchy brings in tourism, however I believe we would have much more tourism if any royal-owned properties were made public and managed like national trust properties for people to visit and look around.
