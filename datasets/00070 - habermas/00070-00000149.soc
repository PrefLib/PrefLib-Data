# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The NHS is a vital public service and the government should ensure that it is sustainable for future generations. This is the case because the government is responsible for the health of its citizens and should therefore provide sufficient funding to ensure that the NHS can operate effectively.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the government has the responsibility to ensure the NHS is sustainable for future generations. However, there are different levels of responsibility depending on the type of action taken. For example, in terms of new technology, the government has the power to ensure it is implemented in the best way. The government has the responsibility to provide the NHS with the resources necessary for this. In terms of prevention of illness, the government can provide funding for this and influence policy in terms of promoting healthy living, but ultimately it is up to the individual to make sure they are as healthy as possible. Conclusion There is a duty on the government to ensure that the NHS is sustainable for future generations. This includes funding research, providing resources for better technology and infrastructure, and encouraging healthy lifestyles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “The NHS is the foundation of public health in the UK. It is vital that the government continue to support and fund it properly in order to protect the health of current and future generations. There is an urgent need for the government to improve wages for healthcare professionals to prevent a mass exodus of doctors and nurses, and to improve their working conditions. There needs to be better incentives for people to lead healthy lifestyles, such as cheaper public transport, and measures to promote healthy eating and discourage unhealthy food and drink consumption. We need to invest more in renewable energy to prevent further damage to the environment and public health from pollution, climate change, and other environmental health hazards.” (written by JH)
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We believe that the government has a responsibility to ensure that the NHS is sustainable for future generations. It is important to allocate enough funding to provide services that are of a good quality. It is also the government’s duty to look after the wellbeing of citizens, and therefore they should invest in preventative policies that discourage unhealthy lifestyles.
