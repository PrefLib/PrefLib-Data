# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Social media companies should be taxed more than they are currently. The tax could be used to fund improvements in online security, support people who's mental health have been adversely impacted by social media and to pay for better monitoring of social media platforms.  The tax could also be used to fund research into the impact of social media on society.  The tax could also be used to fund the development of new social media platforms that are more inclusive and accessible to all.  This would be a fairer way to tax social media companies than a blanket tax.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Social media is a relatively new phenomenon and its impact on society is not fully understood. The introduction of a new tax on social media companies may not be the best way to regulate the industry. However, it may be possible to introduce a tax that is specifically targeted at the negative aspects of social media, such as taxing companies for each case of cyber bullying that is reported. This tax could be used to support people who have been victims of cyber bullying and to help educate people about the dangers of social media.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We agree that social media companies should be taxed more than they are currently.  We also agree that the tax could be used to fund improvements in online security, support people who's mental health have been adversely impacted by social media and to pay for better monitoring of social media platforms.  The tax could also be used to fund research into the impact of social media on society.  This would be a fairer way to tax social media companies than a blanket tax.  This would also ensure that these companies do not gain additional profits from the use of social media and would encourage these companies to take responsibility for the way social media is used.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Social media companies are very big businesses and as such they can afford to pay a tax. They are very influential and can have a huge impact on society. They should be responsible for their actions and have to pay for any mistakes they make. The tax could be used to help improve the monitoring of social media platforms and to help people whose mental health has been adversely affected by social media. The tax would need to be proportional to the size of the company.
