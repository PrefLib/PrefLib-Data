# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Conversely, detractors assert that the immense costs associated with HS2, both in terms of financial resources and enviromental impacts, raise serious concerns. They question the prioritization of such an infrastructure of project over other pressing societal needs, such as healthcare and education. Moreover, the potential disruption to local communitites and ecosystems cannot be understand.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: If we can build anything that allows us to travel faster and easier then I am all for this, although it is such a huge project and will cost the people a lot of money, and even projections of how much will always go up, so on one hand it's like a "no thanks" but i think once done, it would be very worth while and make everyone happier and life faster for lots of people, so all in all i think yes it should be built.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I support the construction of HS2.  This high-speed rail project can reduce travel times, create jobs, and boost economic connectivity and productivity.  Additionally, HS2 will ease the burden on existing rail networks, reducing congestion and enhancing the overall efficiency of our transportation system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I am on the fence about whether HS2 is a worthy investment. I think HS2 could provide a valuable link between London and the North. improving economic relations between the region and perhaps moving away from what feels like a "London First" county and supporting the second rate Northern region. However, since COVID-19 and the rise of accessible digital networking platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom, it is now easier than ever for people to meet without travelling great distances and wasting time and resources for the privilege. Furthermore, with how train prices are in the UK right now, I can't see travelling on board the HS2 ever being feasible for working class, therefore resulting in yet another system designed for the rich. I don't think HS2 is a worthy investment, and the money can be better distributed to local authorities to improve local public transport. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I think we should go for HS2 as infrastructure in the UK is falling behind other developed countries. The North of England is falling behind the rest of countries, it is the betrayal to the brexit voters. I am afraid that UK will further relegate without significant investment in infrastructure.
