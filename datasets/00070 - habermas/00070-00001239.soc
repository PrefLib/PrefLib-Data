# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that climate change is a problem and we need to be more cautious of our impact on the environment. But, we believe that is it irresponsible to talk about climate change in terms of 'catastrophe' or 'crisis'.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The vast majority of scientists agree that the world is warming up, and we humans are largely to blame. In the past we have had natural cycles of warming and cooling, but recently the warming cycle has been stronger and more destructive. Scientists agree that this is not good news. However, it is very difficult to predict the future, or how the world will cope with the changes. The world will not end, but we may have to move to other places, and we will have to live differently. It will be expensive and difficult, but it is not hopeless. It is difficult to know the best way to respond, but it is important to make a start.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Climate change is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. There is scientific evidence that the climate is changing and that this is mostly caused by humans. However, the word crisis is very strong and could be argued to be chosen by journalists to create fear and thus sell newspapers. The word crisis is also very emotive and it could be argued that it is difficult to tell if we are in the midst of a crisis as we have been going through a warming stage for centuries, and may soon hit a 'cooling' stage. However, it would be naive to think that with the amount of for instance cars on the road, congestion, increased human population, that climate change is not occurring and the air becoming of worse quality than say 100 years ago. We should all do our best to reduce our carbon footprint and live in a more sustainable way, but we should not be alarmed by what we see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Climate change is a serious problem that needs to be addressed by governments and industries. However, we are not convinced that the problem is as serious as some activists are claiming.
