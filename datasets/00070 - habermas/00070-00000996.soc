# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of parents having the right to opt their children out of sex education in schools. However, there was some concern that some parents may not be equipped to teach their children about sex education. Therefore, it was suggested that schools should provide information for parents on sex education and how to talk to their children about it. The group also felt that if a child was at risk of harm, for example, being groomed by a paedophile, then they should not be allowed to opt out. The group also felt that if a child was at risk of being sexually exploited, then they should not be allowed to opt out.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, parents should have the right to opt their children out of sex education in schools. The parents are the experts in knowing what their child could or could not handle this information. The parents need to be able to have full control in this matter and maybe for religious or family beliefs this opt out could be vital. The information might have a negative effect on the child and make matters worse, therefore the parents need to have the option to opt out. However, if there is a safeguarding risk or risk for re-traumatisation of a child, then the parents should not have the right to opt their children out of sex education in schools. It is important that children are taught a healthy perspective of sex education for their own safety and development. Parents should not prevent children from gaining this knowledge.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing parents to opt their children out of sex education in schools. The group felt that this was the parents’ right, and that they were the experts in knowing what their child could or could not handle this information. The parents need to be able to have full control in this matter and maybe for religious or family beliefs this opt out could be vital. The information might have a negative effect on the child and make matters worse, and in some cases, it may be that the parents do not agree with the sex education that is being taught. However, the group felt that sex education is an important topic and that it should be taught in schools, as it is important for children to have this knowledge for their own safety and development. The group also felt that if parents do choose to opt their child out of sex education in school, that the school should offer alternative provision to ensure that the child is still gaining this important knowledge.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, parents should have the right to opt their children out of sex education in schools. However, it is important to note that sex education in schools is not only about the biological aspects of sex, but also about the emotional and psychological aspects. It is important that children are taught to respect themselves and others, and to understand consent. Therefore, if a child is at risk of abuse, parents should not be able to opt their children out of sex education.
