# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is acceptable to use a person’s DNA to identify them as a criminal but only in the context of serious crimes and only where the DNA has been obtained legally.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is acceptable to use a person’s DNA to identify them as a criminal. The most important caveat is that DNA cannot be stored for future use. It can only be used for the case in which it is gathered. Further, there should be strong oversight as to the methods of gathering the DNA and its subsequent storage. This should be a very careful and well regulated process. There should also be an opportunity for someone to ask for their DNA to be destroyed after the case is over. It should not be kept for future reference.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the use of DNA to identify a person as a criminal is acceptable. The use of DNA evidence is a very effective way of identifying a person and should be used in conjunction with other forms of evidence. The use of DNA evidence must be closely regulated and should only be used on the most serious of crimes. The storage of DNA evidence after the fact must be likewise regulated. The use of DNA evidence is very effective in solving crimes and identifying criminals, but the use of this evidence should be used in the most serious of crimes and with the highest level of regulation.
