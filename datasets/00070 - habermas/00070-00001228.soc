# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, we should continue to recognise the King as head of state as this provides a consistent and globally recognised figurehead for the UK. The monarch and their family provide a unique brand and tradition which brings in revenue from tourism and enhances our international standing with a head of state to be proud of and a figure that the country can get behind and rally around.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the monarchy, but felt that it was important that the King remained apolitical. It was felt that the monarchy was an important part of our history and traditions, and that the Royal Family brought in a lot of money to the country through tourism. It was also felt that it was important to have a head of state who was not affiliated to any political party, and that the King could act as a unifying force for the country. It was also felt that the Royal Family acted as an important link to other countries and could help to strengthen the UK's relationships with other countries.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The group came to the consensus view that we should not continue to recognise the King as head of state because the concept of a monarchy is outdated, and all the King does is attend ceremonial functions and live a privileged lifestyle.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of the monarchy. They thought that it was a good thing for the country, and that it provided a good source of income for the country. They also thought that it was a good thing for the country to have a figurehead that was not involved in politics, and that the royal family were good for the country as a whole. They did not think that the royal family should have any power, and that the royal family should not be involved in politics in any way. They also thought that the royal family should be more open and transparent about their wealth.
