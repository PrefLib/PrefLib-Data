# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, free broadband access should be provided by the state. This is because the modern world is increasingly reliant on technology and internet access for jobs, education, and taxation and further circumstances, and those unlikely to have internet access due to age or poverty are at risk of being left behind and unfairly disadvantaged. Free broadband to everyone, even just in communal areas within towns/cities, would make a world of difference for those who otherwise have no access, especially as library funding is increasingly cut and spaces like that are closed down.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “I think that free broadband access should be provided to all citizens as it is now a necessity in this day and age.  Some people can not afford the high cost.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It was agreed that the state should provide free broadband to all citizens. However, there was some discussion about the best way of doing this. One participant said that the government should provide a limited, baseline level of access for all citizens, while another participant said that it should be a universal free broadband service for everyone. Another participant said that the government should provide free broadband to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in society, but not necessarily to everyone. A majority of participants thought that free broadband should be provided to everyone and this view was agreed upon as the group consensus.
