# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There are enough regulations to protect workers in the UK, but more could be done to improve their working conditions. The working conditions of some workers is not ideal and more could be done to protect their health and wellbeing. There are enough regulations in place to protect working parents and support their needs. However, more could be done to ensure that they are able to access childcare support and flexible working. There are enough regulations in place to protect workers from harm within the workplace. However, there are not enough regulations in place to protect workers from exploitation and ensure that they are paid a fair wage for the work that they do.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While there is plenty of legislation in place to protect workers in the UK, in reality, the system is not perfect.  There are many groups of workers in the UK that are vulnerable and we believe that more must be done to protect them. We are concerned about workers in the UK who have jobs with less than secure contracts, low pay, few or no benefits, no health insurance and who work for long hours.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is not enough regulation to protect workers in the UK. More can be done to protect workers. Particular areas that need addressing include working conditions, zero-hours contracts and Uber-style "sharing" services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is enough regulation to protect workers in the UK. The health and safety of workers is well protected. However, there are some areas that need to be addressed. There are not enough regulations to protect working parents. Also, there is a lack of regulations to protect workers in the gig economy.
