# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Anti-social behaviour is a very serious issue and can cause a great deal of distress to people and their families. It can also have a detrimental impact on communities. Therefore, it is important to identify people who display anti-social behaviour early on in their lives and provide them with the support they need to help them develop social skills. This may include counselling, mentoring or therapy sessions. It is important to remember that some people may not be able to develop these skills and therefore it is important to provide them with the support they need to help them integrate into society. This may include providing them with their own accommodation and support workers to help them develop the skills they need to live independently.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Punishments such as a prison sentence or other forms of detention have been found to be unsuccessful in rehabilitating offenders. To tackle this problem we need to look at ways to address the causes of this anti-social behaviour rather than simply dealing with the effects. Many people who engage in anti-social behaviour suffer from some form of mental illness or a lack of social development. As such, these individuals should be provided with support such as therapy, counselling or a mentor. In some cases, the person displaying anti-social behaviour may be homeless and in need of help in this area. In these cases, services such as temporary accommodation should be offered to these individuals so that they can be provided with support to overcome their anti-social behaviour. It is essential that these forms of support are put in place before the anti-social behaviour has become too severe.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People displaying anti social behaviours should be identified early and provided support such as counselling, mentoring or therapy sessions. This will help them develop social skills and lead to a better society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People displaying anti social behaviour should be given the opportunity to undertake counselling, mentoring or therapy. They should also be asked to help in the community as part of their punishment and may be required to live in a designated community for anti social persons.
