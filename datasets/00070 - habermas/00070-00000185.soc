# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The NHS is the best healthcare system in the world because of its staff and how well it serves us. It has the highest level of health for the least amount of money. The government should recognise the value of the NHS to our country, and should thus invest more money into it so that it can continue to be the best healthcare system in the world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The NHS is the best health service in the world, and that is because of the fantastic doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers who are working tirelessly to keep us healthy. As such, they need more resources, training, and equipment to do so, which can only be funded by the government. We don't realise how much we take the NHS for granted until we need it, and then we don't complain about the cost of it. We as a country should be proud of the NHS, and should be willing to pay more money for it so that it can continue to be the best healthcare service in the world.” Participants thought that this statement accurately reflects the views of everyone, and that the argument has been well-balanced and is rational and fact-based.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “The NHS is the best health service in the world, and that is because of the fantastic doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers who are working tirelessly to keep us healthy. As such, they need more resources, training, and equipment to do so, which can only be funded by the government. We don't realise how much we take the NHS for granted until we need it, and then we don't complain about the cost of it. We as a country should be proud of the NHS, and should be willing to pay more money for it so that it can continue to be the best healthcare service in the world.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The NHS is a vital part of our country. The health of our country is crucial to our success, and the NHS helps to provide that. Our staff work incredibly hard and we should be supporting them and their efforts. There is a backlog of surgeries, which could be fixed with the correct amount of funding. Funding the NHS is not an option, it is a necessity.” Summary: The group was asked to reach a consensus on whether the UK government should put more money into the NHS. The group were fairly unanimous in that the NHS is vital to the UK, and should be supported and funded. Some people made comments that the NHS is not perfect, but it is better than other healthcare systems, and the NHS staff work incredibly hard, and should be paid accordingly. The group were critical of the government for underfunding the NHS, and the group suggested that this is having a detrimental effect on the service provided. The group felt that the NHS should be adequately funded in order to clear the backlog of surgery and appointments, and to pay for training and new equipment for staff.
