# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Schools should not give more time to teaching philosophy.  This is because although philosophy is a valuable subject, it is not as valuable as some other subjects.  There is a lot of philosophy covered in English already, for example when studying works by writers such as Shakespeare, and in a world that is becoming increasingly focused on science and technology, there are other more important subjects to teach.  If schools have time to spare, it should be spent on science or mathematics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although philosophy is a non-essential subject and we should not be focusing on the teaching of it more than important subjects such as maths and science, we all agreed that we were glad to have studied it ourselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Schools should give more time to teaching philosophy.  It can help develop important critical thinking skills and teach young people how to think logically about more complex issues.  It can also help them explore their own values and beliefs, which can be useful for personal development.  It also teaches them not to just accept the status quo.  It develops their debating skills and introduces them to some high level texts.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Schools should not give more time to teaching philosophy. It is not a core subject that is vital to our everyday lives such as maths and science, it is an additional subject that children should be given the opportunity to look into as an extra. Giving time to philosophy would take time from more important subjects. Philosophy is not important to our everyday lives.
