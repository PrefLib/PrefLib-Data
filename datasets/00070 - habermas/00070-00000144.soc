# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Climate change is the most important research area for scientists to focus their efforts on. This is because climate change will impact the entire world and all species and will ultimately lead to human extinction if it is not reversed. It would be impossible for one person to win a debate against climate change, because climate change is the biggest threat to our existence that we face today.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Dementia research is a much smaller funding area than climate change so I feel there is a greater need to fund more research in this area. There is not enough funding to provide effective research into both and the impact on people is much greater with dementia.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - More funding should be put into dementia research as that is a problem affecting many people and families in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Dementia research is important and should be funded, but in the long term we should put more funding into climate change research as that will be a much bigger problem.
