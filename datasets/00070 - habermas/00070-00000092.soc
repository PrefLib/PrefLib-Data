# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the consensus that cannabis should be allowed to be grown in the UK for medicinal use in controlled conditions. However, the consensus group strongly disagrees with the use of cannabis for recreational use, and people should be encouraged to seek medical advice before trying any drugs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the growing of cannabis for medicinal use should be allowed but we agree that in most cases, it is a recreational drug. We understand that people use it to self-medicate for various conditions but are aware of the dangers and side effects of its use. It is reasonable for people to grow it in a large garden if it doesn't bother anyone else, and for their own personal medical use, but not for recreational use. We are opposed to it being normalised.

Conclusion As you can see, each individual opinion is quite different and has nuances. For example, one participant says that people should be allowed to grow cannabis for recreational use, another disagrees, and another says that cannabis should not be normalised. After the participants considered the pros and cons of the draft consensus statement, and debated the issues in detail, the final consensus view was a well thought out and more balanced opinion. This is not a mathematical consensus, but an opinion of the whole group of people taking into account the opinions of each individual participant. This is called a qualitative consensus. In the example, the group of participants all agree that the growing of cannabis for medicinal use should be allowed but they agree that in most
