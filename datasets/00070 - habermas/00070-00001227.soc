# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a cap on the amount of money that can be raised from donations. This is because it is important to ensure that there is fairness and transparency in the way that political parties are funded. The cap would also prevent any unwanted money being taken into their accounts and also prevent any unwanted donations being made. It is also important to make donations legal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of capping the amount of money that politicians can raise from donations. This is because there is a possibility that the money will be used for purposes other than that which it was intended. Also, the amount of money that is raised may not be representative of the amount of support that the politician has. The group thought that the amount of money that is raised may be representative of the wealth of the donors rather than the popularity of the politician.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a cap on donations made to political parties. This is because there is no guarantee that any given donation is being made in good faith and with the party in mind. It may be that donors are acting with ulterior motives. This could result in parties that are less favoured by donors being disadvantaged.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that there should be a cap on donations to politicians. The reason being that some political parties are better at raising money than others and so if there is no cap, the money could get distributed unevenly and this would lead to a corrupt system. In addition to this, we feel that the amount of money raised should not be a reflection on the quality of the party or the individual candidates as this would mean that a vote could be bought. If people wanted to make donations to a party or individual, they should do so in a legal manner but there is no reason why the amounts need to be so large.
