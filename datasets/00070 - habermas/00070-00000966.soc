# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group was against the idea of eating dogs. The group thought that the idea of eating dogs was particularly abhorrent due to the close bond that exists between humans and dogs in the UK. The group thought that dogs are very intelligent animals and that it would be wrong to kill them for food. The group thought that eating dogs is particularly cruel due to the fact that dogs are often kept in very cruel ways in countries where they are eaten. The group thought that dogs are not necessary for food as there are many other options available. In general, the group was against the idea of eating dogs. The group thought that the idea of eating dogs was particularly abhorrent due to the close bond that exists between humans and dogs in the UK. The group thought that dogs are very intelligent animals and that it would be wrong to kill them for food. The group thought that eating dogs is particularly cruel due to the fact that dogs are often kept in very cruel ways in countries where they are eaten. The group thought that dogs are not necessary for food as there are many other options available.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We generally find the idea of eating dogs to be abhorrent. The reason for this is that in the UK, we generally consider dogs to be more than just pets. We consider them to be a part of the family. Dogs are intelligent creatures and so are capable of experiencing a wide range of emotions. For this reason, we feel that it is particularly wrong to kill them for food. We also believe that dogs are often cruelly treated in countries where they are eaten, for example they are often kept in tiny cages and brutalised. We also believe that dogs are not necessary for food, as there are many other food options available.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There is a strong argument for the fact that eating any animal is wrong and this is a view which most of the group held. We feel that this is a strong argument as we feel that animals, like people, have a right to live their lives as they would want. In addition to this, the group felt that there is an argument for the fact that eating dogs in particular is wrong as they have a particularly close bond with people. The group felt that this was a particularly good argument as it meant that people have developed an even stronger bond with dogs than they have with other animals, making it even more wrong to eat them. In addition to this, the group felt that there was a strong argument for the fact that dogs are particularly intelligent animals and that it is wrong to kill any animal which is as intelligent as dogs for food. The group felt that this was a particularly strong argument as it means that people feel that dogs deserve a higher degree of respect than many other animals, making it more wrong to kill them for food.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Dogs are generally seen as pets in the UK, and therefore it would be unthinkable to eat them in the UK. Dogs are seen as pets as they are highly intelligent, and capable of being affectionate and emotional, and therefore people have developed a close bond with them. In the UK, dogs are seen as very much part of the family, and to kill them for food would be seen as abhorrent and wrong. Other animals used for food, such as cows and pigs, also have strong intelligence and emotions, and can be affectionate. It is thought to be wrong to eat any animal. Animals kept for food are often kept in inhumane conditions, and treated cruelly. Some people believe it is morally wrong to eat any animal. Eating meat is not necessary as there are many alternatives to meat.
