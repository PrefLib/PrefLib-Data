# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, we have come to the decision that school uniforms are not necessary for all schools. It is believed that wearing uniform does not necessarily have a positive impact on educational outcomes for students. We also believe that wearing uniform is often expensive for families, especially those with more than one child. Therefore, we believe that wearing uniform should not be a requirement for all schools, and that parents should be given the opportunity for their children to wear suitable clothes instead of uniform.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Children should not be required to wear uniforms in all schools. While there are some benefits to wearing uniforms, such as being identifiable, not having to worry about what to wear, and making children feel equal, it is also a fact that wearing uniforms is expensive for families, especially with more than one child. Furthermore, wearing uniforms does not necessarily improve educational outcomes for students. In addition, not requiring students to wear uniforms allows them to express their individuality, and does not discourage those who cannot afford uniforms from attending school.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: School uniforms should not be mandatory. The cost of uniforms is often prohibitive for families, and the requirement of wearing a uniform does not improve educational outcomes for students. The requirement of wearing a uniform can also prevent students from expressing their individuality, which can lead to reduced self-esteem. The requirement of wearing a uniform does not prevent bullying, and can sometimes even make bullying worse, as students can be targeted for wearing the wrong uniform, or for not wearing the uniform properly. However, school uniforms can have some benefits. They can make students identifiable, which can be useful in emergency situations. They can also prevent students from wearing clothing that is inappropriate or distracting for a learning environment. Therefore, the wearing of uniforms should be optional, and not mandatory.
