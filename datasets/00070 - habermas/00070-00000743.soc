# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK does have an over-dependence on foreign trade, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. The UK should work to increase its exports, and the government should work to promote a greater sense of economic nationalism.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the UK does have an over-dependence on foreign trade. Over the past 40 years there has been a marked decline on UK produced materials and goods, resulting in the need for goods to be imported from overseas.  The UK has become a service industry following the decline of manufacturing as a whole.  There are some goods which can only be sourced by the use of foreign trade, however many goods we import can and should be sourced from the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK does have an over-dependence on foreign trade. We are importing more than we export. There are some goods and services that we will always need to import from abroad and this is fine as long as we have a healthy level of exports as well.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the UK does have an over-dependence on foreign trade.  Over the past 40 years there has been a marked decline on UK produced materials and goods, resulting in the need for goods to be imported from overseas.  The UK has become a service industry following the decline of manufacturing as a whole.  There are some goods which can only be sourced by the use of foreign trade, however many goods we import can and should be sourced from the UK.
