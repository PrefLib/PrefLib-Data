# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a higher minimum wage but only if it is increased in line with inflation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We agree that minimum wage should increase with inflation, and there should be a higher minimum wage. We believe this is in order to keep up with the cost of living, as prices of goods and services rise every year. Also if it rises with inflation, it will allow people to be able to live and survive, and have a little bit left over, and will reduce the costs to the tax payer, as the state will have to help those on minimum wage with housing, and bills.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a higher minimum wage. The current minimum wage is not sufficient for a good quality of life, and with increasing costs of living and the cost of living crisis, we need to ensure people have enough money to consume and purchase goods and services, helping out the economy. What people get paid right now is not sufficient for a good quality of life, but also to ensure we do not enter recession. If all of our bills can be raised by inflation once a year then the minimum wage and the minimum income being paid to the poorest workers should do the same because otherwise the poorest workers in our society will continue to get poorer and poorer and inequality will only continue to get worse and then clearly work wouldn't be paying and we would be going backwards rather than forwards.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The minimum wage should be increased in line with inflation, but no more. As it is currently at such a level that many people on minimum wage receive benefits,  those benefits should not be restricted; it is the government supporting job creation.
