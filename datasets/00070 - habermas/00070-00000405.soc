# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is okay to take away a child from its parents because of their lifestyle where this lifestyle poses a significant risk to the child. This was a difficult topic to reach consensus on, but we were able to reach a general agreement on it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, taking a child away from its parents because of their lifestyle is not okay. However, if their lifestyle is deemed to be putting the child in physical or emotional danger, then yes, it is okay to take the child away. The issue is that people have different opinions on what constitutes a 'bad' lifestyle. It should be considered on a case-by-case basis. If the lifestyle is affecting the child, then action should be taken. In this example, it is clear that the opinion of the first participant was not at all reflected in the final consensus. The final statement is quite different to the initial opinion of this participant.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In some circumstances, we believe it is justified to take away a child from its parents if their lifestyle is deemed to be harmful. We are of the opinion that this is a delicate matter and we would only endorse such a move as a last resort after all other avenues have been explored and it has been proven that the child is at risk.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Question: Is it okay to take away a child from its parents because of their lifestyle?
