# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We do not think that the retirement age should be raised to 68 as people have worked for 50 years and should be allowed to enjoy a good quality of life before getting to their latter years. We do not think that people in their late 60s would be healthy or fit enough to continue at a certain level of working standards and quality. We also do not think that it is fair to ask people to work for so long and not enjoy a bit of old age before falling sick and death. We also think that society is different now, many people want to retire earlier and travel, or explore different hobbies and we do not think that working till you're even older fosters the right type of work culture.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, as the retirement age is already high enough. The health of people in their late 60s is not always good enough to continue working at the same level of quality. The quality of life of people in their late 60s would be negatively affected if the retirement age was raised to 68. The current retirement age of 66 is already a long time to work and the extra 2 years would be detrimental to the quality of life of people in their late 60s.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, we should not raise the retirement age from 66 to 68. The age of 66 is already old enough, and people have worked hard for many years. They should be allowed to enjoy their retirement, rather than be forced to continue working for longer. We also believe that it is unfair to expect people in their late 60s to be fit and healthy enough to continue working. The current age of 66 is a good compromise, and we do not believe that it should be raised any higher.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, we should not raise the retirement age from 66 to 68. We feel that people should be allowed to enjoy a good quality of life in their latter years and not be expected to continue working until they are 70. The stress of working in a high-pressure environment can be detrimental to a person's health and can also affect the mental health of the population at large. We also feel that if succession is done correctly, it is not necessary to increase the retirement age as there should be people ready to take on the role.
