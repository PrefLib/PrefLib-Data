# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Parents should not generally have the right to know the religion of their teachers. Teachers have a right to privacy and as long as the children are being taught the curriculum in a suitable way, it is no one else's business what the religion of the teacher is.  The only caveat is if there seemed to be some of the teachers religious beliefs creeping into the lessons and the teaching. This could be a subtle way to try to influence the pupils' views and this is wholly unacceptable.  A teacher's religion should not be a factor in how they are treated by their employer or in their employment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Parents should not generally have the right to know the religion of their teachers. Teachers have a right to privacy. The only caveat is if a teacher is being observed influencing a pupil's views based on religion. Then an investigation should be carried out by the school and if the teacher is found to be behaving unprofessionally, then they will have to be reprimanded. However, it is the responsibility of schools to implement checks and balances in their teaching methods to monitor teaching methods, make sure they are suitable and to ensure religious agendas are not present in their teaching methods.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be no need for parents to know the religion of their child's teachers. It should be no one else's business what the religion of the teacher is.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Teachers have a right to privacy and as long as the children are being taught the curriculum in a suitable way, it is no one else's business what the religion of the teacher is.

Participant Feedback What Participant 1 said about the workshop experience: I thought that the entire process was invaluable in that it exposed me to a wide variety of perspectives and thought processes when putting together the consensus statement.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone considering doing it!
