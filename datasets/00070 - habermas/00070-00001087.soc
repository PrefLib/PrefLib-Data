# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People in the UK should no longer have to wear face coverings in public. This is because COVI no longer poses the threat to public health as it did over a year ago. Should there be a reoccurrence of the pandemic then I would fully support mandatory face coverings in public as before.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the wearing of face coverings in public should not be mandatory. This is because the pandemic is now over, and the public is adequately protected through vaccination and natural immunity. However, it is important to note that there are some people who are still vulnerable to COVID, and so it is important that they are able to protect themselves as much as possible. Therefore, we believe that the wearing of face coverings should be mandatory in places where social distancing is not possible, such as on public transport, in shops, and in other crowded places.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It was agreed that the wearing of face coverings in public should no longer be mandatory. However, it was also agreed that the general public should be free to choose to wear a face covering, if they so wish. It was felt that if an individual has a medical condition that they feel would make them vulnerable to infection, they should be able to choose to wear a face covering. However, in general, it was felt that the pandemic was now over, and that the public should not be forced to cover their face in public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the wearing of face coverings in public should not be mandatory as the pandemic is now over.  However, in the event of a future pandemic then the wearing of face coverings should be mandatory in public places.
