# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children should be allowed to have sugar in their diets as long as it is in moderation and it is only given to them on special occasions.  The reason for this is that children need to be able to experience different tastes and textures.  If they are only exposed to healthy foods they will not know what to expect when they go to birthday parties or to restaurants.  It is important for children to be able to experience these things in moderation.  It is also important for children to experience things like this so that they can learn to make their own decisions about what they eat and drink.  It is also important for children to experience these things so that they can learn to make their own decisions about what they eat and drink.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children should be allowed to have sugar in their diets but only in moderation and as an occasional treat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should be allowed sugar in their diets but only if it is done in moderation. There should be more focus on the importance of a healthy balanced diet which is something that can be encouraged with education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children should be allowed to have sugar in their diets within reason. We should educate children on the harmful affects of too much sugar but at the same time we should also not restrict their diet entirely as we would be depriving them of their basic human rights. It is important to ensure that we eat a balanced diet in which sugar is just a small part of.
