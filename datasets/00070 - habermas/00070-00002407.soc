# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that the government should restrict what children under 12 can do and see on the internet. The internet can provide a lot of information that they should not be allowed to see. It can make them more aware of adult issues. It can also put them in danger to criminals. The internet is a wonderful place, with lots of useful information. However, there is also a lot of content on there that can be somewhat easily accessed that can be damaging, especially to younger children. We think that parents should be responsible for what their children see and do on the internet, but we also think that the government should provide some sort of protection for children. We think that porn and violent things should be banned, it can cause fear and bad dreams.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be some restrictions on the internet for children under 12 years old. The government should take the lead on this, but parents should also have a say on what their children can and cannot access. The internet is a wonderful resource, but there are some things that are not appropriate for children. The group of participants also made the following recommendations: The government should make a list of things that are not appropriate for children to see. This list should be agreed with by parents. The list should be regularly updated. The government should make sure that the list is adhered to. The government should also make sure that the list is made available to parents. Parents should also be responsible for making sure that their children do not access inappropriate content. The government should make sure that parents are aware of this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “The government should restrict what children under 12 can do and see on the internet. This is because the internet can provide a lot of information that they should not be allowed to see. It can make them more aware of adult issues. It can also put them in danger to criminals. However, this is the job of the parents. Parents must take responsibility. We do not want a nanny state. The internet is a wonderful place, with lots of useful information. However, there is also a lot of content on there that can be somewhat easily accessed that can be damaging, especially to younger children. I think there should be restrictions because of this. Yes I think porn and violent things should be banned, it can cause fear and bad dreams. Yes, however i can see the debate on how far etc and the fact that it should be limited to what parents want. But there is some obvious options like porn.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “I think that the government should restrict what children under 12 can do and see on the internet. However, I think that it should be left up to the parents to decide what their children can and cannot see. This is because the internet is a wonderful place, with lots of useful information. However, there is also a lot of content on there that can be somewhat easily accessed that can be damaging, especially to younger children. I think there should be restrictions because of this. However, I think that it should be left up to the parents to decide what their children can and cannot see. This is because I think that it is the job of the parents to take responsibility for their children. We do not want a nanny state.”
