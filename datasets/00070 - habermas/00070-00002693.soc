# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: National pride comes from living in a country that is cohesive, where members of the community look out for each other and the populace feel that everyone is playing by the same rules, regardless of their status. At the moment, it is is difficult to say that these important foundations exist in the UK. It is important to remember that the UK is made up of several countries, all of which have their own individual identities, traditions and beliefs. Too often national pride is taken to mean English pride and pride in the British monarchy. If it is decided that national pride is important to social cohesion in the UK, then it is suggested that we assess what it means to be British and what it is that we are proud of in current times rather than relying on outdated ideas of what the UK used to be.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There is a strong argument for promoting a sense of pride in the country and its values, but it is important to be clear about what those values are and how they can be promoted. A sense of pride in the country should not be confused with pride in the monarchy or in the Englishness of the country. A sense of pride in the country can be fostered by highlighting the positive aspects of the country, such as the NHS, the legal system, the welfare state, the education system, the arts, the sciences, sport, the armed forces and the police. The sense of pride should be fostered by all sections of society working together to make the country a better place to live in. It should not be confused with nationalism or jingoism.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of promoting a greater degree of national pride. However, it was recognised that this is a complex issue and that there are different interpretations of what national pride means. It was agreed that it is important to promote pride in what is good about the UK, but that it is also important to recognise that there are many different cultures and identities within the UK and that it is important to respect these differences. It was also agreed that it is important to promote a sense of civic pride and pride in one's local environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be more of a sense of pride in the UK. However, this should not be at the expense of the different cultures and traditions that exist in the UK. It is important to remember that the UK is made up of several countries, all of which have their own individual identities, traditions and beliefs. It is also important to remember that the UK is a multicultural society and that national pride should not be taken to mean English pride and pride in the British monarchy. If it is decided that national pride is important to social cohesion in the UK, then it is suggested that we assess what it means to be British and what it is that we are proud of in current times rather than relying on outdated ideas of what the UK used to be.
