# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a cap on the amount of money that politicians can raise from donations. This is because the amount of money raised may not be representative of the amount of support that the politician has. Also, the amount of money that is raised may be representative of the wealth of the donors rather than the popularity of the politician. The group thought that the amount of money that is raised may be representative of the wealth of the donors rather than the popularity of the politician.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a cap on the amount of money that a politician can raise from donations because it would not be fair to allow one political party an unfair advantage over the other political parties, there needs to be a level playing field for all of the political parties. The amount raised by a politician may be indicative of the number of donors that support the politician, but it does not necessarily mean that it is representative of the amount of support from the electorate, this is because a politician can easily get donors from the businesses he or she favours. There is also a possibility that the donation is made with an expectation that the politician will vote in favour of a business project, which he or she may not want to do. To achieve a balanced and neutral evaluation of the question presented the group reflected on the whole debate from start to finish. The group thought that the group discussion would have benefitted from more input from all of the participants (not just the participants who were against having a cap). The group also thought that participants did not spend enough time on the content and substance of the question, rather they spent a good deal of the allotted time on the format and setting up of the debate, they spent time on whether there should be a

This is because there is a possibility that the money will be used for purposes other than that which it was intended. Also, the amount of money that is raised may not be representative of the amount of support that the politician has. The group thought that the amount of money that is raised may be representative of the wealth of the donors rather than the popularity of the politician. The group thought that it is very important that there are clear rules and regulations about the amount of money that can be donated, and the frequency with which donations can be made. The group thought that this would ensure that there is no 'drip-feeding' of donations, and would provide transparency about the amount of money that is being donated to politicians.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of capping the amount of money that politicians can raise from donations. This is because there is a possibility that the money will be used for purposes other than that which it was intended.

The group thought that the amount of money that is raised may be representative of the wealth of the donors rather than the popularity of the politician. In addition, the group was concerned about that the politician may be skewed by the wealthiest of donors. If there is cap on the amount that politicians can raise from donations, it may help to ensure that all donations are collected in a systematic and legal manner. It may help to provide the much needed transparency and ensure a fairer distribution of funds.
