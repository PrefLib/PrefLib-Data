# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should ban the production of food products containing palm oil as this would help reduce deforestation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the production of palm oil is an environmental issue. The palm oil industry is one of the major causes of deforestation. Deforestation increases greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and contributes to climate change. Deforestation has also destroyed the habitats of already endangered animals and continues to do so. Palm oil farming is also a major overall contributor to greenhouse gasses rising, and therefore global warming.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Palm oil is a contributing factor to deforestation, climate change, the killing of endangered species, and the use of child labour. For these reasons, the group believe we should ban palm oil.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Palm oil is the worst oil to consume, for animals, for the planet, for you. We are highly recommend you cut palm oil out of your diet.
