# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be higher rates of income tax for those earning more than £150,000 per year. This is because there is an urgent need for tax receipts in order to pay for areas such as health and benefits. In addition, people who earn this amount of money can meet their needs relatively easily with a lower amount of money so could afford to pay extra tax. This would also re-inforce a sense of social solidarity where richer people pay for poorer people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that we should impose higher rates of income tax for those earning more than £150,000 per year because the rich can afford to pay more tax and this will help those who are less well off. It would also increase a sense of social solidarity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, we should impose higher rates of income tax for those earning more than £150,000 per year. This is because they can afford it, and it would help the country to pay for health and other benefits for the lower paid. It would also help to create a more equal society where those who earn less do not feel that the richer people are getting off lightly. This would re-inforce a sense of social solidarity where richer people pay for poorer people. We should do this but at the same time keep the higher tax rates as low as possible in order to avoid rich people leaving the country and reducing the country's economic activity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of higher rates of income tax for those earning more than £150,000 per year. The reasons for this were that people on lower incomes were struggling to make ends meet and that the higher earners could afford to pay more. In addition, the higher earners would still have a lot of money left over even if they paid more tax. The group also felt that the higher earners would be more likely to pay the extra tax if they felt that it was being used to support poorer people.
