# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a balance between making money and improving education standards. The UK should continue to fund state schools to ensure that the poorest of the poor get an equal chance to get an education. However, the government should allow for-profit organizations to run schools in areas where the quality of education is very low. Conclusion: The group came to a very fair consensus opinion after debating this question. There is no need for government to be involved in the day to day running of schools. However, it should provide funding to all schools. In addition, private companies should be allowed to run schools as this will lead to a better management and higher quality of education for students.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The education system is run by a set of rules which need to be obeyed to allow schools to be of the highest standard. To allow for profit companies to run schools would risk the education of children and their safety. It would change the way in which teachers work and also how they are treated. Also, the school's curriculum could be changed by a company to suit their own agenda which might be different to the parents or the child's wishes. It is also a known fact that when companies run for profit, they tend to be better managed and have better working standards, as this means that they will get more customers which means they will make more money. This could apply to schools too.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the U.K. government should not allow for-profit organizations to run schools. But, to allow a level playing field for all, if a for-profit organization is allowed to run a school, the school should not be eligible for funding from the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Profit making organizations should not be allowed to run schools, for profit can jeopardize the quality of education. However, private organizations can be allowed to run schools with a stipulated amount of profits to be allowed. This can be done with a maximum limit on profits and a well designed contract of the services provided.
