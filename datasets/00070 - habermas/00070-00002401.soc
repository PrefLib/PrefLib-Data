# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the decision that the BBC licence fee should be reduced by half. We think that the BBC provides a great service to the public and that the licence fee is a good way to fund the BBC. However, we also think that the licence fee is quite expensive and that a lot of the money at the BBC is wasted. We think that the BBC should focus more on essential services such as news, current affairs and important events. We also think that they should focus on educational programmes and reduce the number of entertainment programmes and leave that to other services. This would help to reduce what is a mandatory licence fee. We do not believe in the licence fee and think that it should go more the route of streaming services where people can sign up but if it remains mandatory it should be reduced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the BBC is a good service and we believe that the licence fee is a fair price to pay for the service that they provide. However, we also believe that the licence fee is too high and should be reduced to reflect the current financial situation that people are in. We also believe that the BBC should focus more on essential services such as news, current affairs and important events. They should also focus on educational programmes and reduce the number of entertainment programmes and leave that to other services. This would help to reduce what is a mandatory licence fee.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: “We have come to the conclusion that the BBC licence fee should be cut in half as the BBC provides a great service, however we believe that they are making enough profit as it stands and that the fee should be reduced for the benefit of the public. We also believe that the BBC is a public service and that they should be focusing on essential services such as news, current affairs and important events. They should also focus on educational programmes and reduce the number of entertainment programmes and leave that to other services. This would help to reduce what is a mandatory licence fee. Personally we do not believe in the licence fee and it should go more the route of streaming services where people can sign up but if it remains mandatory it should be reduced.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The BBC is a great institution that provides many services and we do not want to see it disappear, however, it does need to change. The licence fee is a relic of the past and needs to be replaced with a subscription service. The BBC needs to focus more on the news and current affairs and reduce the number of entertainment programmes and leave that to other services. It needs to stop being a competitor to other services and focus on what it does best. The BBC needs to be more transparent and open about its finances and the way it spends the licence fee. It needs to stop wasting money on vanity projects and focus on the core services that it provides. It also needs to stop providing services that are available elsewhere.
