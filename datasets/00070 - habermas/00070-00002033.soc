# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It was agreed that the public are too focused on blaming the actions of consumers for the current environmental issues, whereas the biggest cause of environmental destruction is the largest corporations and their unethical, profit driven decisions. As we move towards the future, more and more of these corporations will have to make the decision to be more ethical in their business practices, or they will face much higher taxes and penalties. It is the government's responsibility to protect the environment, but ultimately it is up to the people to elect the government who they think is most suitable to do so. It was also agreed that education is a big part of protecting the environment, with schools making an effort to educate children on environmental issues and how they can play a part in protecting the environment. However, education alone will not solve the issue. We need to be willing to put in effort and money to protect the environment, and only then will we see a positive change.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the average person is trying to do their part to help protect the environment. However, it is difficult for the average person to have a big impact on the environment as the biggest polluters are the large corporations and the government. The average person can only do so much as the people in power are the ones that need to change the way they act. The government and large corporations are not doing enough to protect the environment and need to be pressured to do more.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is more that can be done to protect the environment. However, it is the responsibility of the people with the most power to make the biggest changes. We can make small changes individually, but these will not make a big enough difference.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although there are a number of individuals who are taking steps to protect the environment, there are still more steps to be taken by society and companies.
