# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People should be allowed to demonstrate for any issue they are passionate about as long as the demonstration is peaceful and does not harm or stop other people going about there daily lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should be allowed to demonstrate for any issue they are passionate about as long as the demonstration is peaceful and does not harm or stop other people going about there daily lives. There should be some restrictions on the right to demonstrate to ensure that people's safety is maintained and also to ensure that emergency vehicles are able to go through roads that may be blocked by a demonstration. The right to demonstrate is a core human right, that should not be restricted by the government. It is one of the core pillars of basic freedom of speech, the right to demonstrate. Yes to the ones that causes mayhem in public e.g sitting on motor wars or randomly going to art places and destroying a painting for no reason. But same time if it's a peaceful demonstration then that's totally fine and there shouldn't be no restrictions. It would be wrong to put restrictions on the right to demonstrate.  We are all entitled to our opinions.  We are also entitled to display our opinions in the form of demonstration.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be no restrictions on the right to demonstrate. The right to demonstrate is a core human right, that should not be restricted by the government. It is one of the core pillars of basic freedom of speech, the right to demonstrate. The right to demonstrate should be unquestionable, but the right to destroy property shouldn't be. Burning cars of completely uninvolved innocent people, looting businesses, destroying artwork or businesses should not be allowable.  People should be allowed to demonstrate for any issue they are passionate about as long as the demonstration is peaceful and does not harm or stop other people going about there daily lives.  It is important to note that the main changes made to the consensus statement were changes that the participant making the critique themselves agreed with.
