# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: While in principle the group was in favour of immigration, the group felt that the devil is in the detail. The group felt that there needs to be the ability to care for everyone in the country whether they are born there or immigrate to it. If a country cannot provide for everyone within its borders, it is irresponsible to continue to allow unlimited immigration. The quality of life of everyone in the country needs to be considered and access to necessities such as housing, healthcare and education for all the population need to be addressed and a strategy in place. Allowing unlimited numbers to add to the population of a country, if you cannot provide for their basic needs is not helpful. If people come to this country under the impression they can be cared for and then find themselves in dire circumstances it is not fair. If people are coming to this country illegally this is a different matter. It is not necessarily an issue of the people that are coming here, but more of a case of the fact that it helps to fund human rights violators and their ability to make a profit out of people who are seeking a better life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There are benefits to immigration, but the devil is in the detail. The word mass is the problem. There needs to be the ability to care for everyone in the country whether they are born there or immigrate to it. If a country cannot provide for everyone within its borders, it is irresponsible to continue to allow unhindered immigration. The quality of life of everyone in the country needs to be considered and access to necessities such as housing, healthcare and education for all the population need to be addressed and a strategy in place. Allowing unlimited numbers to add to the population of a country, if you cannot provide for their basic needs is not helpful. If people come to this country under the impression they can be cared for and then find themselves in dire circumstances it is not fair. If people are coming to this country illegally, this is a different matter and the group felt that this is not the way to help improve people's lives. It is not necessarily an issue of the people that are coming here, but more of a case of the fact that it helps to fund human rights violators and their ability to make a profit out of people who are seeking a better life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group of participants was in favour of immigration. However, the word mass was the problem. There needs to be the ability to care for everyone in the country whether they are born there or immigrate to it.
