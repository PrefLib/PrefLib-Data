# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Nuclear power is a cleaner energy source than coal or gas and is the best option currently available. A new power station would create jobs and help the economy. The group was in favour of a new nuclear power station, however felt that more research into alternative energy sources was needed. It was felt that nuclear power was not a long term solution and that a new power station should be built as a temporary measure while other sources of energy are developed. However, while the group was able to reach a consensus view, there were still a number of individual differences of opinion that had not been resolved: The issue of safety of nuclear power. The need for new sources of energy to reduce greenhouse gases. The possibility of alternatives to nuclear. The acceptability of nuclear as a long term energy source.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of a new nuclear power station. It was felt that nuclear power was a cleaner energy source than coal or gas and was the best option currently available. The group felt that a nuclear power station would create jobs and help the economy. However, the group also felt that more research into alternative energy sources was needed. It was felt that nuclear power was not a long term solution and that a new power station should be built as a temporary measure while other sources of energy are developed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The group of participants in general was in favour of a new nuclear power station. It was felt that nuclear power was a cleaner energy source than coal or gas and was the best option currently available. The group felt that a nuclear power station would create jobs and help the economy. However, the group also felt that more research into alternative energy sources was needed. It was felt that nuclear power was not a long term solution and that a new power station should be built as a temporary measure while other sources of energy are developed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We were generally in favour of a new nuclear power station. Nuclear power is currently the cleanest energy source available. We felt that it would create jobs and help the economy. We felt that nuclear power is a cleaner energy source than coal or gas. We felt that a nuclear power station would be good for the environment. However, we did feel that more research into alternative energy sources was needed. We felt that nuclear power was not a long term solution and that a new power station should be built as a temporary measure while other sources of energy are developed.
