# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should allow people from other countries to come and work in the UK.  There is lots of evidence to suggest that the UK has benefitted enormously from immigration and the NHS would not be able to survive without it now or in the past.  Many of the doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are from other countries. We also rely on many other immigrant workers in parts of the workforce which are crucial to the economy.  We are a nation of immigrants and people from lots of different countries have made their mark on the UK, enriching our culture and society.  People from different countries bring with them a diverse range of skills, talents and experiences, which is crucial in today’s global economy, and their presence benefits the economy.   Not only do we get something in return for the tax that they pay, but we also make our lives better by taking advantage of the benefits of immigration.  It has been very beneficial to our society and has promoted cultural exchange and understanding, enriching our diverse society.

We have been built on immigration and the NHS would not be able to survive without it now or in the past.  There are also jobs which are crucial to the economy which we rely on immigrants to fill. Having people from lots of different countries working here adds to the diversity of the workplace and is a good thing.  It brings a diverse range of skills and talents to the workforce, enriching the economy.  It can fill in gaps in our labour markets.  Also it can promote cultural exchange and understanding.  Immigration can boost productivity and entrepreneurship.  We can encourage a global outlook creating a vibrant, inclusive society. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
