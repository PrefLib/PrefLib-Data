In order to be a happy person, it is necessary to be a good person. In order to be a good person, we must do what is right, even if that means sacrificing our own immediate happiness. But in the end, the happiness of others will come back to us in many positive ways.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, being a good person is more important than being a happy person. Being a good person can make you happy, but being a happy person does not necessarily make you good.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, it is more important to be a good person than to be a happy person. This is because being a good person is not only good for yourself, but for the people around you and society as a whole. It is a moral obligation to be good to others, and if you are not, it is likely that you will not be happy in the long term. If you are a good person, you will have the respect of others and this will lead to happiness. Being a good person is not always easy, and it is important to find a balance between being good and being happy.
