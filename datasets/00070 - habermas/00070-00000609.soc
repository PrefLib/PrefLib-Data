# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we do not think that parents should have the right to know when their children have received contraception. It is a personal decision and one that should not be forced upon a child. It is the responsibility of the parents to educate their children and ensure they have the information to make an informed decision. This is also the role of the education system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, parents should not have the right to know when their children have received contraception. It is important that young people can access contraception in confidence and without barriers. If they are concerned about their parents finding out, they may not seek contraception or may take greater risks. The best a parent can do is try to speak to their child about these types of topics and the education system should also be informing but we don't see why a parent should be informed of this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, parents should not have the right to know when their children have received contraception. Children need to feel comfortable to be able to access contraception. If the parents knew then this may put the child off from accessing contraception. Parents should have the right to know about their children's medical information up to the age of 16.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, parents should not have the right to know when their children have received contraception. There are more benefits to the child if they do not have to inform their parents. The child may be more likely to use contraception if they do not have to inform their parents and may also be more likely to attend appointments if they know their parents will not find out. This will reduce the rates of teenage pregnancy and STIs. The participants had to debate a range of topics, with the main themes being teenage pregnancy, abortion, sex education, the morning after pill, and contraception. The group was split in two and one group had to argue in favour of their chosen topic, with the other group arguing against. They were then swapped over and they had to argue against their previous topic and in favour of the new topic.
