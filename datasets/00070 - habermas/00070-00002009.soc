# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While alcohol abuse is a serious problem that affects many families and individuals, the majority of people who consume alcohol do so responsibly and banning the sale of alcohol would create more problems than it would solve. There is a range of measures that could be taken to reduce alcohol-related harm, such as more rigorous age verification procedures, increasing the tax on alcohol, and limiting the times at which alcohol can be purchased. However, banning the sale of alcohol would impact negatively on the majority of law-abiding citizens and would be an unwarranted and disproportionate reaction to the problem of alcohol abuse. The alcohol industry is a major contributor to the economy, providing employment for tens of thousands of people in the UK, and banning the sale of alcohol would lead to a significant increase in unemployment, and would impact negatively on the economy as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There is a clear need to tackle the problem of alcohol abuse in our society, but the negative impact of banning the sale of alcohol would be greater than any positive impact. A more effective solution would be to increase the tax on alcohol, increase the price of alcohol, and more rigorous age verification procedures. This would help to discourage alcohol abuse while not impacting on the majority of law-abiding citizens who enjoy alcohol in moderation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Final consensus statement: While alcohol abuse is a serious problem that affects many families and individuals, the majority of people who consume alcohol do so responsibly and banning the sale of alcohol would create more problems than it would solve. While there is a range of measures that could be taken to reduce alcohol-related harm, such as more rigorous age verification procedures, increasing the tax on alcohol, and limiting the times at which alcohol can be purchased, these actions would impact negatively on the majority of law-abiding citizens and would be an unwarranted and disproportionate reaction to the problem of alcohol abuse. Instead, the government and civil society must look into other ways of reducing alcohol-related harm such as greater education about responsible drinking, community-based interventions in specific ‘hotspots’, and a re-definition of what it means to be a responsible adult.

There is a range of measures that could be taken to reduce alcohol-related harm, such as more rigorous age verification procedures, increasing the tax on alcohol, and limiting the times at which alcohol can be purchased. However, banning the sale of alcohol would impact negatively on the majority of law-abiding citizens, restrict our freedom, and be an unwarranted and disproportionate reaction to the problem of alcohol abuse.
