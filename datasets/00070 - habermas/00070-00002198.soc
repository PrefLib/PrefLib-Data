# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The House of Lords is an important part of the British political system. It provides checks and balances for the House of Commons. However, it is not representative of the people and is largely filled with people who have been appointed by the Government of the day. This means that they are biased towards the party that appointed them and are not able to act as a fair counterbalance. The House of Lords needs to be made representative of the people. This can be achieved by allowing the people to elect the members of the House of Lords, rather than them being appointed by the Government. This will ensure that the people are able to hold the Government to account and that their views are represented.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The House of Lords has a number of advantages in the UK. It gives an opportunity for people who are not politicians to enter the political world. It provides a counter-balance to the House of Commons and acts as a way of checking the powers of the Government. However, the way the House of Lords currently works needs to be overhauled. The members should be elected by the public, rather than being appointed by the Government of the day, in order to reflect the will of the people. It is not necessarily the structure of the House of Lords which is the problem but rather how it is currently used and how it is composed. It needs to be improved to reflect the values of the people it represents and is intended to represent. The actual fact of the question may seem trivial to non-British citizens but the principles which it deals with, namely the importance of checks and balances within a system, the importance of preventing authoritarianism, the importance of the will of the people, and the value of elections, are important for any democracy to thrive. The debate around the question, the reaching of a consensus view, the critiques, and the final statement, highlight many of the points which have been discussed in this essay,

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The House of Lords has a number of advantages in the UK. It gives an opportunity for people who are not politicians to enter the political world. It provides a counter-balance to the House of Commons and acts as a way of checking the powers of the Government. However, the way the House of Lords currently works needs to be overhauled. The members should be democratically elected and, more specifically, they should be democratically elected by the public rather than by Parliament (however that is constituted). It is only through this process that the views of the people will be represented in the House of Lords. It is not necessarily the structure of the House of Lords which is the problem but rather how it is currently used and how it is composed. It needs to be improved to reflect the values of the people it represents and is intended to represent.
