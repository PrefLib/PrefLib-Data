# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe we are in the midst of a climate crisis. All evidence points to this conclusion. The summers are getting hotter and hotter, winter is not as cold as it used to be and it seems to be getting worse every year. Scientists have proved that the climate is changing, the world is becoming warmer and we must do something now before it is too late.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes we are in the midst of a climate crisis. The evidence is that temperatures are increasing, heatwaves are becoming more common, wild fires are more common and the amount of floods is increasing. The ice in the polar caps is melting, the ocean temperature is rising, there are reports of more extreme weather. It is bad for the environment and many animals, birds and plants are under threat of extinction. It is making it harder for humans to survive, the price of food is rising and the poor are worst effected. It is damaging to health and is causing more deaths. The government is not doing enough about it because it is not in the interests of the rich and powerful corporations who are making lots of money from damaging the planet. The corporations lobby government to continue to do nothing about it. We need to get together and force the government to make changes. We need to stop the corporations from damaging the planet. We need to stop using fossil fuels. We need to stop throwing rubbish in the sea and polluting the rivers, lakes and seas.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, we are in the midst of a climate crisis. The climate is changing rapidly and we are seeing the effects of it in the news everyday. The planet is warming and we are seeing new temperature records being broken. This is affecting the environment and it is causing problems for people, animals and plants. We need to take action now to prevent further damage to the planet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We are in the midst of a climate crisis. The climate is changing and this is causing problems for the planet. The climate is getting warmer and this is causing problems for the planet. We are seeing more floods, more wild fires, more pollution, heatwaves and so much damage to habitats and environments. This is caused by huge corporations damaging our world in the name of profit. Our government allows this and allows companies to pollute our rivers, seas and lakes by dumping chemicals and raw sewage into it. They allow pesticides that kill bees. This is happening across the world. The change in climate is harmful to life and some species may not survive it. Some parts of the world may stop being suitable for humans to live.
