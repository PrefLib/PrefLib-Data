# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of raising taxes on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service. The group was in favour of this as they felt that the NHS was in crisis and that it was important to support it. The group also felt that this was a fair way to raise the money as it would not impact on the majority of the population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The current health crisis is well known to everyone and it is a growing issue. This is not entirely ideal but it can be a temporary way to deal with this issue pending when some more long term solution can be implemented. It is not fair to take money from anyone that is earning legitimately, but if there is any way it can be implemented without it taking a toll on the people earning above that then it can be a temporary solution which should be reverted as soon as the main issue has been dealt with.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK should raise taxes on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service. The National Health Service is one of the most important services in the UK and it is struggling to provide the level of care it used to. This is a result of underfunding and the government has not done enough to support it. The NHS is a vital service that benefits everyone in the country, and it is only fair that those who can afford to pay a little more do so. The people who earn over $200,000 will barely notice the extra tax as their income is so high, and it will help to support the NHS. The NHS is an important service that is struggling to provide the level of care it used to, and it needs as much help as it can get. This is a temporary solution to a growing problem, and the government should do more to support the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Raising taxes on people earning more than $200,000 to help pay for the National Health Service is something that should be considered by the UK government. However, this should be seen as a temporary measure, with the aim of finding a more long-term solution in the near future. The NHS is the most fundamental aspect of the UK, and it is essential that it is made stronger. This can be done by a temporary increase in taxes on the wealthiest in society, as they can afford it. If we do not act now to fix the NHS, it will only continue to deteriorate. We cannot rely on the lowest earners to fix the NHS, we need to give those with the highest earnings the chance to contribute more. The consensus opinion above was written by all five participants, and each and every person in the group agreed with the final opinion reached.
