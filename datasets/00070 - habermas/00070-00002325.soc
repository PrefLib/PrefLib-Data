# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the decision that it is not acceptable to own a pet in a small apartment if you are out all day. We believe that it is not fair on the animal to be left in a small space for long periods of time. We believe that the animal would become distressed and lonely and that this would not be fair to the animal. We also believe that if the animal is left in the small space for long periods of time, it may become destructive and this may cause problems with the neighbours. We believe that the animal should be walked at least twice a day and be allowed to run around and play. The animal should also be allowed to socialise with other animals. We also believe that the animal should have a good quality of life and that the owner should be able to spend time with the animal. If the owner is not able to do this, then they should not own a pet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of owning any animal as a pet if you live in a small apartment and are at work all day. The general feeling was that this would be unfair on the animal and that they would be unlikely to get the exercise and socialisation that they require. The group felt that smaller animals such as hamsters and birds would be more suitable for this type of environment, but that even these animals would require some attention during the day. The group felt that it would be unfair to leave any animal alone all day and that this would lead to the animal becoming distressed. The group felt that it would be more suitable to wait until you have a larger home and more free time before getting a pet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of owning an animal as a pet if you live in a small apartment and are at work all day. The group felt that this would not be fair on the animal and that they would not be able to get the exercise they need. The group felt that the animal would become stressed and could become destructive. The group felt that it would be better for the animal to be re-homed to a family who could provide a better environment for them. The group did agree that there were some exceptions to this. For example, if the animal was a small animal that did not need much exercise and was happy to be left alone for long periods of time. The group also agreed that there are alternatives to re-homing the animal, such as paying someone to check in on the animal or take it for a walk around lunchtime.
