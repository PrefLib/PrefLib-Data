# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be term limits for MPs. This is because it can prevent corruption and can help to ensure that the views of the people are being represented. The group felt that there should be a limit of around 5 years for MPs to serve in office and that there should be an upper age limit of around 65 years old.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of term limits for MPs. This is because it can help to prevent corruption and can help to ensure that the views of the people are being represented. It can also help to ensure that MPs are working hard for their constituents and not just becoming career politicians. There was a consensus that an upper age limit for MPs would be a good idea and that there should be a maximum number of MPs who could represent one area, this is to ensure that younger and fresher ideas are incorporated into government and that the views of the younger generation are being taken into account by the government. The group felt that there should be a limit of around 7 years for MPs to serve in office, and that there should be an upper age limit of around 65 years old for MPs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be term limits for MPs. MPs should be limited to serving in office for up to around 10 years. The upper age limit for MPs should be around 65 years old. The reason for the consensus view was that the group felt that by having term limits it can help to ensure that the views of the public are being represented in the government. It can also help to prevent career politicians who may become corrupted or out of touch with public opinion. However, the group also recognised that it can be beneficial to have MPs who have served for a long time and have built up expertise in their area. The group felt that around 10 years is an acceptable term limit. The group also felt that an upper age limit of around 65 years old was appropriate. The reason for this is that in general, the group felt that older people have more life experience and can bring this to their role as an MP. However, the group also recognised that younger MPs can also have life experience and be effective as MPs. The group felt that this was a fair and reasonable compromise between the views of the participants and represented their view as a whole.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: It would be desirable to have term limits for MPs for many of the reasons cited above. A good place to start with the term limit would be 5 years and the age limit should be 60 years old. How well did this group of participants do in achieving a consensus?
