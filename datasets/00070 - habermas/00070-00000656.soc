# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of building new nuclear power stations in the UK. It was felt that this would help reduce the UK's dependency on fossil fuels and would help the UK reduce its carbon footprint. It was also felt that this would help address the spiralling cost of electricity for consumers. However, the group also felt that the UK should invest in developing renewable energy sources such as wind farms and solar power. The group felt that the UK should be doing everything it can to reduce its dependency on energy provided by countries outside the UK.
