# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group felt that consuming animals for food (eating meat) should be allowed. It is not a right but it is not illegal. Humans have for millennia hunted and ate wild animals. We have now domesticated this activity and we have reliable sources of food - farming, agriculture, and importing foodstuffs. We have the right to eat meat as is is part of our history, our culture, our religion(s) and our daily lives. Should we look to move away from meat consumption? Yes. Should we encourage less meat consumption? Yes, but the right to eat animals for food should continue to be allowed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Humans have the right to use animals for food. This is a complicated issue and there are very valid reasons to suggest otherwise. In life and death scenarios, we fully support consuming animals for food, and we believe human rights and our livelihoods are more important than those of animals. It becomes more complicated when we look into modern life, where we have the ability to live our lives without necessarily involving eating animals (some societies are different, we are focusing more on the first world) where eating animals is arguably morally wrong and is unquestionably poor for climate change. There are some health benefits to eating enough protein, however we can get protein elsewhere that has less of an impact on the planet. We believe we have the right, but it is a grey area.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Humans have the right to use animals for food. However, we should not abuse this right and we should respect the lives of animals. We should be mindful of our impact on the environment and on the health of animals and humans. We should also be mindful of the suffering of animals and make an effort to reduce the suffering of animals.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There is a right for humans to use animals for food, however there is a strong argument for the right to be limited in some circumstances. There is a strong argument for the right to be limited in some circumstances. The group came to the view that in life and death situations, it is right for humans to use animals for food. However, in modern life, there is a strong argument that we should be limiting the use of animals for food. The reasons for this are that there are viable alternatives, and that the use of animals for food has a significant impact on the environment, and is arguably morally wrong. The right to use animals for food is complicated, and is an issue that is very difficult to reach a consensus on.
