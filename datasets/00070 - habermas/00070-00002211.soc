# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Yes, people should be allowed to be self-employed at 16 years old. People should be allowed to be self-employed at this age if they have the right skills and if they have support from a mentor or an organisation for young entrepreneurs. This will help them develop their ideas. However, they should be allowed to do so only if they have a good business idea and they know how to develop it. It is important to note that the person who is self-employed should be allowed to continue with his or her education, as this is the best thing for them at this age.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, people should be allowed to be self-employed at 16 years old. However, it is very important that they are allowed to do so only if they have the right skills, they understand what it means to be self-employed and they have a really good idea and/or business plan that is going to work. It should also be the case that the person who is self-employed should be allowed to continue with his or her education, as this is the best thing for them at this age.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Yes, people should be allowed to be self-employed at 16 years old. This is the case because they are allowed to work for others at this age, so there is no reason why they shouldn't be allowed to work for themselves. However, they should be allowed to do so only if they have the right skills, they understand what it means to be self-employed and they have a good idea and/or business plan that is going to work. It should also be the case that the person who is self-employed should be allowed to continue with his or her education, as this is the best thing for them at this age.
