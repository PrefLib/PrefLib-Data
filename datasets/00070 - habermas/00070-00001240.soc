# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of a basic income, but with some caveats. The group felt that a basic income would be a good idea if it was implemented in a way that would incentivise people to work, and if it was implemented in a way that would be fair to all citizens.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group came to the consensus view that the government should provide a basic income to all citizens. They also stated that this should be dependent on skill level, as well as a guaranteed job creation by the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that a basic income should be provided by the government to all citizens, but that this income should be provided based on skill levels. This means that it would be provided on a sliding scale based on a number of different factors, including age, employment status, income levels, and skills. It is our view that a basic income could work in this country, and that it would help to drive the economy by creating a basic level of security for all citizens. It would allow people to make better decisions about their future, to spend money on things that are important to them, and to use their skills and talents to add to their basic income, in order to gain greater benefits and financial freedom. It would be fair and allow all citizens to have a more equal playing field, where people can be judged on the value of their skills and knowledge rather than by their economic status.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of a basic income for all citizens. However, this was dependent on the income rate, and that it should be dependent on skill level. The group also felt that the government should create and provide jobs to people for basic life to sustain. This also will get the economy moving and generate more buying power. The group also felt that the basic income should be provided to all citizens, but it should be dependent on skill level. Finally, the group felt that the government should provide a basic income to all citizens because it provides a safety and security that many can currently not achieve in this economic climate. There is also the issue with AI and robotics that can now do many of the jobs people used to do, which means that people are being pushed out of their careers and job opportunities. Finally, having a basic income would allow for all people (regardless of background) to be able to pursue their specialties/talents/interests, and create a more equal society.
