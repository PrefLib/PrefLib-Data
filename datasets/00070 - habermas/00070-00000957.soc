The UK had access to a large market, which meant that businesses could trade freely and there was an influx of investment into the UK. UK citizens were able to travel freely within the EU, which was a positive for the economy, and for the social development of the UK. The UK was able to influence EU policy and legislation, which meant that the UK was able to have a say in the direction of the EU. However, the UK did not benefit in all areas, and the UK was also negatively affected in some areas. The UK had to contribute financially to the EU, which was a cost to the UK. The UK was also affected by EU laws and directives, which the UK did not have a say in creating. However, the positives of EU membership definitely outweighed any negatives.
