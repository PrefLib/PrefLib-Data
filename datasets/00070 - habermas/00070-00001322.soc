# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, we have decided that artificial intelligence can advise humans on important decisions, however, we believe that humans should have the final say in all important decisions. We have come to this conclusion because we believe that humans have the ability to understand the context of a situation and also have the ability to make decisions based on emotion, whereas artificial intelligence is unable to do either of these things. Summary/Decision: With no further suggested revisions, the participants came to a unanimous conclusion. Outcome: The group were fairly comfortable with the outcome, and there was general agreement that the consensus was fair and that all views had been included in the final statement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In conclusion, the group has decided that artificial intelligence can offer impartial and well informed advice. However, it is ultimately a human's responsibility to have the final say in all important decisions. We have come to this conclusion because we believe that humans have the ability to understand the context of a situation, whereas artificial intelligence is only able to refer to past decisions and human experience. We also believe that humans have the ability to make decisions based on emotion, which an artificial intelligence cannot do.

We also believe that humans have the ability to make decisions based on emotion, whereas artificial intelligence is unable to do this. We have also taken into account that artificial intelligence can offer more unbiased opinions and has access to a wide range of information that it can consult.
