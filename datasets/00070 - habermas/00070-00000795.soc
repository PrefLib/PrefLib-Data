# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that parents should be allowed to allow their children to drink alcohol in a controlled and responsible manner. It is important to remember that drinking alcohol in moderation is a socially acceptable practice and that it is not illegal for children to drink alcohol. If parents allow their children to drink in a responsible manner, this can reduce the risk of children experimenting with alcohol in a less responsible manner. The age of the child is an important factor in this decision. It is important that the child is mature enough to drink responsibly and in a safe environment. Parents should also take into account their own relationship with alcohol. If they have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol, they should not allow their children to drink alcohol. If they drink responsibly and in moderation, they should be allowed to allow their children to drink in the same way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the conclusion that it is OK for parents to allow their children to drink alcohol at home. The age of the child is an important factor and so we think that from the age of 13 it is acceptable for a small amount of wine or cider to be consumed by children alongside their family. We think that there is a school of thought that suggests doing this leads to a better control and less desire to binge drink in later years. It also helps to show trust to your children which can be a challenge in early teenage years. We also think that it is important that the parents use sensible attitudes to this area, we think that if parents are too strict it can make children more rebellious and want to have something that seems sacrosanct and they go out of their way to drink alcohol.  So sensible attitudes by parents is perfectly acceptable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing children to drink alcohol at home from the age of 16.  The key proviso to this was that the children should be supervised and that the parents should take an active role in educating their children about the risks and responsibilities of alcohol consumption.  It was felt that this would help to develop a sensible attitude to alcohol and reduce the likelihood of children binge drinking when they reached the legal age to drink alcohol.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of allowing children to drink alcohol at home. The group felt that it is important to introduce alcohol in a safe environment, in order to help prevent the development of an unhealthy relationship with alcohol in later life. The group thought that alcohol should be introduced in a safe environment, such as the home, and that it is important for children to learn how to drink responsibly. It was thought that the introduction of alcohol at home is likely to reduce the desire to binge drink in later years. The group agreed that it is important for children to see their parents drinking alcohol in a responsible way. The group also felt that parents should be the ones to introduce alcohol to their children, and not their friends.
