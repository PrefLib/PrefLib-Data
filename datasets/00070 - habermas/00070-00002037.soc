# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a statutory requirement for schools to be open for a minimum number of days each year. The number of days should be decided by the school in conjunction with the parents and children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a statutory requirement for schools to be open for a minimum number of days each year. This ensures that schools can meet the statutory requirements for education in the UK and children get the education they need to thrive. It also ensures that schools can continue to provide a safe place for children to be, for example from neglect at home.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the statutory requirement for schools to be open for a minimum number of days each year is a good idea. This is because it ensures that children are getting the best education available to them, and it also provides a safe space for a lot of children. However, it is important to note that every school is different and what works for one school may not necessarily work for another. Therefore, schools should have the freedom to choose when they want to be open, now there are so many ways of teaching that don't just involve a classroom. For older students they may benefit from learning at home some times, and for younger students it is important that they have a safe space to go to and that they are able to get the best education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “There should be a statutory requirement for schools to be open for a minimum number of days each year. School days are crucial for the growth and development of students, as they are when students learn the most. With the rising cost of education, parents are relying more and more on their schools to educate their children, which is why it is essential that they are open a set number of days a year to allow children to progress in their learning. School is also an essential place for students to develop social skills, and therefore if schools were to be closed for extended periods of time, students would be likely to develop negative social skills, which may affect them throughout their lives.”
