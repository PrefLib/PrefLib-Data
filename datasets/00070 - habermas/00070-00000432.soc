# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK government should ban the sale of fur. Fur is not an essential item and has not been used by the majority of the UK population for years. With the introduction of modern materials, there is no reason to allow the sale of fur. The hunting of animals for their fur is extremely cruel and unnecessary. The fur trade should be made illegal.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK government should ban the sale of fur. It's unethical and unnecessary for the UK to support the trade of fur.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK should ban the sale of fur, as it is a very cruel thing to do, it is also unnecessary and can be replaced by other materials such as fake fur. Fur is also not an essential part of life as we can survive without fur.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The uk government should ban the sale of fur. The animals are hurt when they are hunted and the fur is not needed. This was a difficult process as you can see, but in the end it worked. Participants were able to discuss their views in a non-threatening environment and find a consensus on the issue in hand.
