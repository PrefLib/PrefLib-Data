# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Education is extremely important for the development of individuals and society, but we believe that there is a need for some cost to be borne by students in order to provide a greater sense of value to the qualification and as a result greater incentive for students to make the most of their university experience.  We believe that the cost of attending university should be reduced to make it more accessible to those from poorer backgrounds.  We believe that free tuition is achievable and desirable, but only for home students.  This is a challenge to the current system, but not a total overhaul.  We recognise that it is an expensive system to maintain, but the advantages of having a well-educated population with a wide variety of skills and talents is important.  It is our hope that we will be able to implement such a change in the near future.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Education is extremely important for the development of individuals and society, but we believe that there is a need for some cost to be borne by students in order to provide a greater sense of value to the qualification and as a result greater incentive for students to make the most of their university experience.  Whilst we accept that the current costs are too high and discourage some from pursuing higher education, we believe that university should remain accessible to all, provided it is a right and not a privilege.  This is an important point for home students, but also those who come to the UK to study, as diversity on campus is shown to improve the experiences and understanding of all who are studying.  We believe that tuition fees need to be reduced to a level which is more affordable to all students and that free university tuition should be restricted to home students only as the costs of international students are too high for the government to be able to cover. Other themes that came out in the discussion about this question were:   - the level of interest and determination of an individual to study and their prior performance are good indicators of potential success at university   - experience from working was important in providing an understanding of the world and motivation to study at university
