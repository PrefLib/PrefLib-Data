# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - As a country we should be more active in helping other countries. If we see any form of crisis, be it famine, political unrest, natural disasters etc, we should help. We also need to ensure that we do not allow help to be misdirected away from those who actually need it. It is important to remember that we are all on this planet together, and our struggles as humans are collective. We should help where we can, but we must ensure that our help is targeted to genuine need and used effectively. We should also accept that we can't help everyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - As a country we should be more active in helping other countries. If we see any form of crisis, be it famine, political unrest, natural disasters etc, we should help. We also need to ensure that we do not allow help to be misdirected away from those who actually need it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - As a country we should be more active in helping other countries. If we see any form of crisis, be it famine, political unrest, natural disasters etc, we should look to help. The extent to which we help would depend on a range of factors, and also how many countries would be willing to help as well. We also need to ensure that we do not allow help to be misdirected away from those who actually need it. Also, it is also important to remember that we should not feel responsible for other countries. Their political and social issues are of their own making and therefore should not expect us to help them. If we can help, we should, but if not, it is not our problem.
