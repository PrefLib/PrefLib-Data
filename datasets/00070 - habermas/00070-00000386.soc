# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Trade is a good thing for the world, and generally trade barriers should be avoided. Trade is something that can benefit all parties and allow for all economies to grow and become stronger. On the other hand, we can't completely ignore the negative effects that global trade can have on a nation's economy, so we must be willing to provide support to local industries in times of need.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Free trade is generally a good thing for the world. It's important to avoid being too protectionist and keeping to oneself, as this will only lead to countries getting left behind in the race for economic prosperity. At the same time, we must also be mindful of the effects that free trade can have on local industries and provide support to those who need it.
