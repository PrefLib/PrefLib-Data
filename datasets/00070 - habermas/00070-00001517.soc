# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Consensus statement reached: In general, the legalisation of recreational drugs like cannabis is a good idea. The Government could make a lot of money from taxing the sale of cannabis, and this could be used to improve the country. It would also mean that cannabis is sold in a safe way, and people would be less likely to buy cannabis from criminals. However, there are some risks. For example, if cannabis is legalised, it might make it more accessible to children, and this could have a negative impact on their health. Also, if cannabis is legalised, people might feel more comfortable driving or doing other activities while under the influence of cannabis, and this could be dangerous. Therefore, the legalisation of cannabis should be done carefully, and with strict rules in place to make sure that it is used safely. This would help ensure that cannabis use can bring about as many benefits as possible, while still being safe.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There are arguments for and against the legalisation of recreational drugs like cannabis. On the one hand, the Government could make a lot of money from taxing the sale of cannabis, and this could be used to improve the country. It would also mean that cannabis is sold in a safe way, and people would be less likely to buy cannabis from criminals. However, there are some risks. For example, if cannabis is legalised, it might make it more accessible to children, and this could have a negative impact on their health. Also, if cannabis is legalised, people might feel more comfortable driving or doing other activities while under the influence of cannabis, and this could be dangerous. Therefore, the legalisation of cannabis should be done carefully, and with strict rules in place to make sure that it is used safely.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The legalisation of recreational drugs like cannabis is a controversial topic. There are both pros and cons to this. The legalisation of cannabis could lead to a decrease in the criminal element of the sale of cannabis and could also make it safer for people to purchase cannabis. However, legalising cannabis could lead to it being more accessible to children, and this could have a negative impact on their health. It is also important to remember that even though cannabis isn't seen as dangerous as a class A drug, it can still cause harm.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We generally agree that it would be a good idea to legalise cannabis. There would be plenty of benefits to legalisation, such as the generation of more tax revenue, a safer method of purchasing the drug, and the fact that criminals wouldn't be involved in the trade. In addition, we disagree that it would be more accessible to children. If anything, cannabis is easily accessible for children now, and legalising it would mean that the Government would be able to enforce stricter rules on who can purchase it. Conclusion A consensus statement is more than just a majority viewpoint, it represents a full discussion amongst an entire group, and thus often has a strong sense of reliability about it, unlike some arguments (i.e.
