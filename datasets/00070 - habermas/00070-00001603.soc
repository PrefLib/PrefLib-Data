# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that we should be giving aid to other countries, but we also need to be careful where the aid goes, and should be ensuring it goes to countries that need it and can actually use it. It would be better if we could help them to become self-sustaining, rather than always relying on the charity of other nations, and we should be looking to support countries in doing that. We should also be looking to ensure that the money is not wasted, so we should be careful about the amount we are giving, and checking that the money is being used effectively. The reason we feel that we should give aid is that the people who are living in countries that are not self-sustaining are still human beings, and so deserve a life that has a chance to be as healthy, productive and happy as anyone else's, wherever they are.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should give aid to other countries, but this aid should be used to improve infrastructure which will help the country develop, and not to help individuals directly. This will help the global economy, and improve the quality of life for everyone.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that aid should be given to other countries as we are one of the most developed nations in the world and have an obligation to help other nations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In principle, we should give aid to other countries. We are one of the richest countries in the world, and we have a responsibility to help those less fortunate. However, the aid should be given to countries where it can be guaranteed that it will be used for the intended purpose, and the money should not be used to support corrupt regimes. The foreign aid we give is often a minute amount of the government's budget and stopping that wouldn't really free up enough money to help us out. In fact a lot of the foreign aid we give is in order to develop infrastructure such as ports/bridges and roads which benefit the global economy and us in turn. I don't think foreign aid is a purely philanthropical pursuit but more of an economic investment.
