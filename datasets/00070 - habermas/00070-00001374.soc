# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of banning fast food chains from operating near schools. However, the group also felt that the issue was not as simple as it first seemed. The group felt that it was important to make children aware of the dangers of eating fast food and to educate them about healthy eating. The group also felt that children should be encouraged to make their own choices about what they eat, and that it was important for children to be able to make their own mistakes. The group felt that it was important to be able to eat fast food in moderation, and that banning fast food chains from operating near schools would not necessarily stop children from eating fast food.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Fast food chains should not be allowed to operate near schools because they can have a negative impact on children’s health, by making them think it’s ok to eat fast food, leading to obesity and other health problems.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should be taught how to make good choices and how to eat healthily. However, we don't think it is appropriate to ban fast food chains from operating near schools. It is not appropriate to ban things from children that are available to adults.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that banning fast food chains near schools would not have the desired effect of improving the health of the population, and that in addition, this measure would unfairly punish business owners. Fast food chains offer a product that many people enjoy, and this is not something that should be prevented. If people wish to improve their health, they can make the choice to eat healthily, and if they don't, it is their decision. If we wish to have a healthy society, we must encourage people to eat healthily, but not ban things that are unhealthy. The government should invest in educating children and adults on healthy eating, but not on banning fast food chains near schools.
