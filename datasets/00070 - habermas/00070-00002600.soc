# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Plastic is one of the most used materials for products. If we are to properly combat climate change, you have to put in some sort of limitation to the people that are using plastic to an absurd amount so that they can try and find an alternative. If it isn't taxed they will continue to use this resource as free as they want.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I think that plastic products should be taxed because they have an negative effect on the planet as they are very damaging for the environment, from the energy they consume being made to being non recyclable. There needs to be a drive to reduce the amount of plastic being produce, hopefully by introducing a tax it will reduce the production of plastic being made and cause from more alternatives to be found.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I would say yes as the production of plastics (through oil drilling) contributes significantly to CO2 emissions and thus climate change. From a financial perspective, it would be a good way for the government to increase the public coffers. Apart from raising awareness on a very sensitive issue, there is also a monetary value that cannot be ignored.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: i believe  that plastic products should be taxed to discourage their production and use given that they cause extensive and long term harm to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I believe single-use plastic products should be taxed, which would increase the price of these items, and perhaps buyers would think twice about purchasing the items. I think as long as there are alternatives I don't see why they should not be taxed as there are so many other ways to package items in a durable and more sustainable way. Plastic is killing our environment.
