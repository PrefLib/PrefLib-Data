# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a maximum wage for footballers. The current system is divisive and creates a gap in society. It also creates a false sense of achievement for those who earn a lot of money. It is not right that people who have little responsibility for the country earn so much more than those who do. The Prime Minister is responsible for the whole country and should be rewarded for this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of a maximum wage for footballers to ensure that they do not earn more than the Prime Minister. However, the group was divided as to whether this would be a good idea in practice. Some thought that it would be a good idea, as it would prevent footballers from earning obscene amounts of money and would prevent footballers from earning more than the Prime Minister. Others thought that it would not be a good idea, as footballers bring in a lot of revenue to the country and it would be unfair to cap their wages.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not have a maximum wage to ensure that footballers do not earn more than the Prime Minister. While the issue of whether footballers should earn more than the Prime Minister is a valid one, it is not one that can be solved by introducing a maximum wage. It is not in the interest of the country to reduce the income of footballers, as they bring in a lot of revenue to the country. The issue of whether footballers should earn more than the Prime Minister should be addressed by increasing the salary of the Prime Minister, not by reducing the salary of footballers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of a maximum wage for footballers. While some people in the group felt that footballers should not earn more than the Prime Minister, the group as a whole felt that this was not a good way to approach the issue. The group felt that it was more important to ensure that people in society were not being left behind, and that a gap in income was not corrosive to societal cohesion.
