# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, we should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison. The emphasis should be on a shift from the current position to more of an emphasis on rehabilitation, addressing triggers for crime and using a multi-agency approach to reduce offending. Currently, on release, the prisoner is told to engage with the probation service but can have little incentive to do so. This means that many cases of breach are brought before the courts which is time consuming and expensive. We need to have a more targeted approach when sentencing. Where the probation service and the magistrates have a greater flexibility and the ultimate sentence of prison is a tariff only for those beyond reasonable chance of rehabilitation. This was a fun exercise and although the process of coming to an agreement was slightly laborious at times, in the end it did produce a well thought through and well argued consensus view.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, we should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison.

Where the probation service and the magistrates have a greater flexibility and the ultimate sentence of prison is a tariff only for those beyond reasonable chance of rehabilitation. Conclusion: If people feel that they have been treated fairly and the whole system of criminal justice is seen to be fair, then there will be less chance of a future cohort who view themselves as being alienated from society, having nothing to lose and consequently committing crimes. To assist this there needs to be more effective work with families of the convicted so that there are the supports available and practical solutions offered to prevent re-offending.
