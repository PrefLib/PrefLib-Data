# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While we all agree that social media plays a vital role in the dissemination of information, we also acknowledge that sometimes information that is shared may be false, inflammatory or otherwise harmful.   The consensus is that the government can take steps to regulate social media, particularly in the areas of protection of personal data and ensuring the information shared is factually correct.  It is however important to ensure that the government regulation does not infringe on the rights of users to express their views freely and also does not hinder independent journalism.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of some form of regulation of social media.  It was felt that this was necessary to protect the interests of users and to ensure that social media companies were not able to exploit their users.  However, the group was also of the opinion that the regulation should be light-touch and that it should not interfere with the freedom of users to express themselves.  The group felt that it was important that users were aware of how their data was being used and that this information was readily available to them.  The group also felt that there should be some form of independent body that would be responsible for ensuring that the regulations were being adhered to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Government should have a supervisory role and work with social media companies to improve their security and protection of their users, but should not impose rules on what users are able to post, so long as it does not breach libel or privacy laws.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the government is best placed to regulate social media.  This is because they are elected by the people to represent the people and are therefore best placed to make decisions on behalf of the people.  However, the government needs to be careful not to infringe on people's rights to free speech.  The government also needs to be careful not to over-regulate social media, as this could lead to a restriction of the flow of information and a limitation of people's ability to express their views and opinions.  The government also needs to be careful not to regulate social media in a way that is biased towards their own views and opinions.
