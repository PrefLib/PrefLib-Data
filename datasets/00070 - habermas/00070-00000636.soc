# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that people should be encouraged to donate blood, bone marrow and organs. We believe that this is a moral duty and that people should be encouraged to do so. We also believe that people should not be forced to do so and that it should be their choice. We believe that it is a good thing to do, and that it should be encouraged but not forced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, people should be encouraged to donate blood, bone marrow and organs. There is no ethical duty to donate, however. People should be able to make their own decisions and there should be no compulsion to donate. If people were more informed of the benefits of donation, they may be more willing to donate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, people should be encouraged to donate blood, bone marrow and organs, but the decision to do so should be a personal one.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be an ethical duty to donate blood, bone marrow and organs after death.  There is little risk to the donor and the potential benefits to the recipient are huge.  It is a life and death situation.  If a person is willing to take an organ they should be prepared to donate one.  The risk to the donor is minimal.  It is the right thing to do.  If a person is not willing to donate then they should not expect a transplant when they need one.  A person has a moral duty to do what they can to save the life of another.  The fact that someone has died does not mean that their body is no longer of use.  It is better to donate the organs than let them rot in the ground.  The body is no longer of use to the deceased but can be of great use to the living.
