# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the idea of selling organs to be used in transplants is unethical as people should not be exploiting their own bodies for profit. The idea of donating organs to help others is one that is already very established and is a selfless act in which people should feel good about. This should be encouraged, but if people want to sell their organs, they should be free to do so, as it is their body and therefore their choice. There would need to be careful regulation put in place to make sure that the person selling their organ is doing so of their own free will and isn't being exploited. It should also be heavily regulated to make sure that the transplant surgeons are not using organs from people who are being exploited or are using organs that have been tampered with, such as the genetic makeup being altered. This project was designed by members of the Moral Cognition & Social Psychology Research Group, University of Sheffield.

However, people should be allowed to sell their organs if they want to, but it must be heavily regulated. The potential exploitation of people selling their organs is a real concern and therefore the people selling their organs should be closely monitored to make sure that they are not being coerced and are not in desperate need of money. If someone is being exploited and is selling their organ, this could lead to long term health problems and could have been avoided. In order to stop organ trafficking, which would become an issue if selling organs became common practice, it would be necessary to make sure that the organs being sold are genuine and have not been tampered with. It is therefore very important that those who are selling their organs are properly assessed to make sure they are making the decision of their own free will.

If someone is being exploited and is selling their organ, this could lead to long term health problems and could have been avoided. In order to stop organ trafficking,
