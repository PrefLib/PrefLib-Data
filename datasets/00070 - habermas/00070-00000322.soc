# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Question: Should it be possible for you to legally download copyrighted material from the internet for free?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, it should not be legal to download copyrighted material for free. Copyright is there for a reason and protects the work of others. Whilst copyright law could be amended for digital use, it should not be removed from the internet to offer copyrighted material for free.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of protecting the rights of copyright holders.  However, as long as copyright is acknowledged and the materials downloaded are not used in a public facing format or used for commercial gain, then the group were not entirely against the idea of downloading copyrighted material.  The group also felt that small, free samples should be allowed for a certain period of time to allow for sampling of the materials.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is not fair to be able to download copyrighted material for free. Copyright protects the material and the creator, therefore it should be respected and protected.
