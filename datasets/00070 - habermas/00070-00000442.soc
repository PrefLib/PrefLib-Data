# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing the tax on plastic bags, and argued that this is a good way to make people think twice about their use of plastic bags, which in turn would reduce the impact of plastic bags on the environment. The group also discussed the fact that the UK is a large producer of plastic, and as such, it is important that we also make efforts to reduce our own impact on the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a ban on single-use plastics.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, it would be more helpful to charge supermarkets, who create the vast majority of plastic waste.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although plastic bags have a detrimental impact on the environment, a higher tax is the wrong solution. The tax is ineffective, and makes very little difference in reducing the use of plastic bags. A tax on plastic bags would just increase the price of a bag and people would pay regardless, because plastic bags are convenient. The tax doesn't change the fact that plastic bags are bad for the environment, it just makes them more expensive. Instead of taxing plastic bags, we should look to completely banning them, or banning their use for certain goods, and look to other bigger issues in the environment.
