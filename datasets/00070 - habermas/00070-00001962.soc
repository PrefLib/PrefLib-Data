# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that while it is an important part of the House of Lords that they are not subject to party political propaganda, this means that it is difficult to justify their role as an elected body. We do believe that certain seats should be elected by the public however. This will ensure that a cross-section of the population has a voice in Parliament and that it does not appear too elitist or distant from the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the House of Lords is an important part of the British political system. It is a necessary check on the power of the House of Commons and its members are often more experienced and knowledgeable than their counterparts in the Commons. However, the current system of appointment is outdated and needs to be reformed. A small number of members of the House of Lords should be elected. This would ensure that the House of Lords is not completely out of touch with the views of the British people and that it is not seen as an elitist institution.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It was agreed that the House of Lords should be subject to an election process for a certain percentage of its members. It was agreed that this would maintain the balance between a wholly unelected House of Lords and a wholly elected House of Commons, and would keep the House of Lords from becoming a redundant institution. However, it was also agreed that a wholly elected House of Lords would have some undesirable effects, and would compromise the independence of the House of Lords, which is one of its key roles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the House of Lords should be elected. The current system of hereditary peers is outdated and should be abolished. However, there should be a certain number of seats in the House of Lords that are appointed by the Prime Minister. This would ensure that the House of Lords can remain independent from the House of Commons and would be able to provide an effective check and balance on the government.
