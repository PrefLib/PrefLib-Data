# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Smoking in public places should be banned for health reasons for the general public and to discourage the younger generation to refrain from smoking. This was a difficult topic for participants and a good discussion ensued. It was eventually decided that they would come up with a group statement that included aspects from all participants. It was felt that banning smoking in public places was a good way to protect the health of the general public as well as a good way to discourage the younger generation from taking up the habit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Smoking in public places should be banned for health reasons. Smoking is not only bad for the health of the smoker, but also for people around them. It is not only the smell that is bad, but also the second hand smoke that people inhale. This can cause lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. Smoking is also very expensive, and by banning smoking in public places, it will discourage people from starting to smoke. This will have a positive impact on the health service as there will be less people with smoking related diseases. It will also have a positive impact on the economy as people will have more money to spend on other things.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Smoking in public places should be banned. The main reason for this is that it can indirectly damage the health of others in the vacinity of the smoker. It is a bad habit for the health of the smoker too, so banning this in public place may reduce the amount people smoke. This should then have a positive knock on effect on our health service.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that smoking should be banned in all public places such as restaurants, pubs, clubs, work places, schools and colleges, etc. However, we believe that designated smoking areas in these places should be introduced where people can smoke without damaging the health of those around them. The benefits of doing this is that it could encourage people to cut down on smoking or even stop smoking altogether, which will have a positive effect on their health, their wallet, and their quality of life. Furthermore, those who do not smoke will not be inhaling toxic chemicals and pollutants.
