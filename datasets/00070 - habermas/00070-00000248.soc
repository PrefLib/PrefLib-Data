# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There has been a huge debate in the UK about the smoking ban and whether it has been a good thing or not. Although it is clear that it has been a positive thing from the perspective of public health, it has been argued that it has led to many pubs and other licensed premises closing down and has had a huge negative impact on the economy. However, pubs and other licensed premises which have survived the ban are thriving, as they are now more family-friendly places and are more accessible for people who do not want to be exposed to second hand smoke. We have concluded that the ban has been a good thing from a public health perspective but the economic impact on pubs and other licensed premises is less clear.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The introduction of the smoking ban has been a good thing in many ways, although some people who smoke and are regulars in pubs are clearly going to disagree with this view. Some may even say that the ban is an infringement of their civil liberties. However, the ban has undoubtedly had a positive effect on public health, especially as regards passive smoking. The ban has also made pubs more accessible for families, which is a positive thing. This means that the pub remains an important part of the community and is a positive place for families and children to spend time together. The smoking ban is a good thing but we do have to acknowledge that the introduction of the smoking ban has been a financial disaster for a lot of pubs, which has led to a large number of pubs going out of business. The ones that remain open now have to depend on food trade to stay open. This is a shame, because pubs are also a vital part of the social fabric of life in a lot of towns in the UK and it is sad that they are no longer as busy as they used to be. We conclude that the introduction of the smoking ban has been a good thing, but only after having taken into account that a lot of pubs
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The smoking ban has been a good thing in some ways but in others has had a negative impact. While it has clearly been a positive step forward for public health, this is a viewpoint that may not be shared by everyone, especially regular smokers who visit pubs and feel that their civil liberties have been infringed upon. We feel that the ban has been a good thing for families, making pubs more accessible to them, although the pub trade has suffered from the ban, resulting in the closure of many pubs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The introduction of the smoking ban has been a good thing in many ways, especially as regards public health. However, it is also true that some pubs have suffered due to the loss of trade that has occurred since the ban was introduced.
