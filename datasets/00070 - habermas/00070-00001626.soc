# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We are not over-populated, but it does feel that way. This is not just due to the fact we are seeing over-population in certain areas of the country but also due to the fact that there is not enough housing, jobs, GP appointments, and schools. There are a lot of reasons that there is overpopulation in the UK. Immigration is one of the most common reasons people cite, however immigration in the UK is actually falling, which is likely to continue with the recent Brexit referendum. However, immigration can still have a big impact on the UK’s population. In 2015 when there was a rise in immigration, it accounted for a rise of 600,000 people in the UK’s population, this is still a significant amount. In areas such as the capital of London, it is also seeing an increase in population due to natural growth. This is mainly due to the fact that the population in London is younger than in the rest of the UK. There are also significant pressures on the public sector in the UK. The population in the UK is set to rise by the year 2033 to 77 million. This is an example of a group of people with opposing views, coming together and after some deliberation,
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We are not over-populated, but it does feel that way. The population is one of the biggest problems we face in the UK today. This is not just due to the fact we are seeing over-population in certain areas of the country but also due to the fact that there is not enough housing, jobs, GP appointments, and schools.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Final consensus statement: We believe the UK is not over-populated, however the aging population is an increasing concern for the public health system. We also believe that Brexit and immigration will have a big impact on population growth.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We are not over-populated, although it certainly feels like it. We know that the population will be rising to 77 million by 2033 which does have major implications for services as mentioned in our first draft statement. However, we also feel that this is not all down to immigration into the UK. London is undergoing a huge population increase from the number of births, and not just immigration, which the first draft statement failed to recognise. This is key to understanding why we feel that the UK is not yet over-populated, but feels like it is due to the strain on services. We feel that the pressure on services such as healthcare is partially a management issue, as healthcare can be managed to provide for the demands of the larger population, but also to an increasing ageing population who may require more healthcare, so solutions are needed for this.
