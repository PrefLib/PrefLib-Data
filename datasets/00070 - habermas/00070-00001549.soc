# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: Football teams should not accept sponsorship from gambling companies. Football reaches a vast audience, and gambling is not something which should be advertised to such vast audiences. Even more so in the current economic climate where lots of people are struggling financially it only will add to this problem. Gambling is proving to be a difficult problem for the society, and it is highly addictive, which can lead to emotional and financial harm. Having gambling companies splashed across football shirts is like endorsing what these companies do, which is to get people to place more and more bets each time. There have been recent incidents where people died by suicide as they were addicted to gambling, racked up a lot of debt, and could not cope with the immense stress and the mental difficulties caused by their addiction. This should be an area that is strictly regulated, not flaunted across the most popular sport.

Both processes focus on seeking the common ground amongst disparate views and interests of participants, which, with adequate facilitation, can ultimately aid creative decision-making and allow parties to develop less-confrontational and more trusting

Conclusion There is a good chance that the football industry could collapse if betting companies were to pull out of their sponsorship deals.
