# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, we believe that people have a right to expect a comfortable retirement. We all work hard throughout our lives, and contribute to the economy and society in general, and so we should be rewarded for this. We believe that the most comfortable retirements should be reserved for those who have worked the hardest and contributed the most, but in reality this would be difficult to implement. We also believe that those who have not worked, or who have not contributed positively to society, should not have a comfortable retirement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the idea that people who have worked hard throughout their lives should be able to expect a comfortable retirement. The group did not feel that this should be a legal right, but rather a moral one. The group felt that people who have worked hard and contributed positively to society should be rewarded with a comfortable retirement, as this would provide them with a sense of achievement. The group felt that this would also encourage people to work hard and contribute positively to society. The group felt that a comfortable retirement would mean having a home with warmth, light and reasonable foods. The group felt that this would be a basic level of comfort, and that people who have worked and earned more throughout their lives should have extra money to spend on luxuries if they wish.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, we believe that people have the right to expect a comfortable retirement. This is because we believe that people who have worked hard throughout their lives should be rewarded for this. However, we also recognise that some people are not able to work, and so they should also have a comfortable retirement. We believe that people should be able to have a comfortable retirement because they have contributed to society in some way, and this should be rewarded.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, we do have the right to expect a comfortable retirement. This is because we have all worked hard and contributed to society throughout our lives. In an ideal world, the most comfortable retirements would be reserved for those who have indeed worked the hardest and been the most positive influence on society, but in reality this would be difficult to implement. As before, we should be able to expect a comfortable period towards the end of our lives.
