# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I believe we should invest more in social services as they can provide a good impact with people that need it  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In my opinion the government should invest more in science and research than in social services. I think that investing in science will lead to new industries developing, and to greater efficiencies in existing industry. These industries will add to the tax take of the government. This extra income can then pay for the social services we need. Investing in social services will not bring in this increased income, meaning social services will be underfunded in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should invest in what is needed at this time, and that i social services. We have an increasing aging population so more older people are in need of help. Children are on the street and homeless now, science won't help them. People are being abused in their homes and many other crimes that social services need resources for
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I believe we should invest more in science and research because it will be better in the long term. There are a lot of things that we don't understand about our planet. But with more funding for science and research, we could discover so many things. For example, did you know, that we have only explored like 6% of the Earth's oceans? If we could explore more of it, there might be resources there that can help develop our medicine further/
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - i think we should definatly invest more in social services. There are so many children who unknowinly rely on them to protect and help them without i think so many children or young people would suffer so its vital
