# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - While it may seem fair that food taxes would be more democratic than income tax as everyone will be paying, the idea of the NHS being funded by a national tax on food should not be considered as it will affect the poorer parts of society who are already struggling with feeding their families. While there are pros and cons for both sides of this argument, the government must be careful when deciding how to fund the NHS. It is easy to think of taxing unhealthy foods in order to make people more healthy, but we should be careful of such a solution as this would be a discriminative measure against the less fortunate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We are in favour of this method of funding the NHS because it would give a fairer distribution of taxes in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of funding the NHS through a tax on food. They felt that food is already expensive, and that the poorest people in society would be hit the hardest by this tax. They also felt that a tax on food would be difficult to implement, as it would be difficult to define what food is, and what is not food. The group also felt that it would be unfair to tax unhealthy food, as this would penalise the poorest people in society, who are often the ones who buy the cheapest food, which is often the least healthy. The group also felt that a tax on food would not raise enough money to fund the NHS, and that a tax on income would be a fairer way to raise money to fund the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The NHS should be funded by a national tax on food, instead of income tax, because it is a fairer way of allocating the costs of the NHS across society.
