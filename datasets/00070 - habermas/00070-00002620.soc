# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, art should be nice to look at. Art can be quite subjective and abstract but if it does not evoke any strong emotion upon viewing or experiencing it, then I believe it is a lost opportunity. Any art that is easy on the eyes also has the chance of uplifting and inspiring us - it is difficult to get motivated on seeing art that is visually challenging, so it should be nice to look at.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I believe that art is subjective, so what may be considered nice to look at is at the opinion of the person who is viewing it. Someone may believe that a piece of art is nice to look at, whilst another person believes that it is not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I disagree, art is a representation of emoition and feeling in any way the artist wants to express this. Weather someone finds it 'nice to look at' is irrelevant. If the art evokes a feeling or emotion from the person viewing it, then its purpose has been met. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Art is, in its rawest form, a spectrum. it depicts the ugliness and the beauty within our world. take van gogh, his depression was so visceral and gutting however he made some of the most beautiful paintings. a different example would be the viral showcase of womens clothes that depict what they were wearing when they were raped - a sari and a diaper in the same collection. we all know that art is subjective but it is how it is created and how it moves us that portrays its appearance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - yes the art is a field which looks greatly nice. i is a very interesting field. it one of the most favourite fields of the people in my society
