# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should limit the number of times a person can run for political office. It is not healthy for democracy to let individuals cling to power indefinitely. Ideas may get stagnant and this may lead to a lack to progress. There should be fresh candidates to bring new attitudes and projects to the table. It would not be possible to advance and go forward politically without new political leaders.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the number of times a person can run for political office should be limited. However, this should be done with care and there should be exceptions to this rule.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that term limits should be imposed on the number of times someone can run for political office. Although it is true that politicians who have experience and have made good decisions should be allowed to run, this does not always necessarily translate into better decision-making. Therefore, while we believe that it is essential to have good political leaders, we also believe that it is important to limit the number of times they can run for office, as it is essential to have a broad spectrum of opinions and new ideas to be put forward.
