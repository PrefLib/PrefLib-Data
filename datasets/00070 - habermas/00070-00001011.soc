# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should be responsible for the cost of caring for the elderly.  There are many people who will not have family to help look after them, or may not be able to afford the care they need.  The elderly have spent their working lives paying into the social care system, so it is only right that they are looked after when they can no longer look after themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government should be responsible for the cost of caring for the elderly.  It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that the elderly are cared for in their twilight years.  It is not the responsibility of the elderly to fund their own care.  The elderly have spent their entire lives working and paying taxes.  It is only right that they should be cared for in their later years.  The government should provide funding for caring for the elderly.  If we're lucky we all get old and deserve to be treated with dignity in our twilight years.  Many decent hard working people and their families won't be able to afford or provide good quality care for elderly relatives so it's only right that those who have paid their dues their whole lives are afforded the care they deserve.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of the government providing support for the elderly.  It was noted that in many cases, the elderly will not have immediate family ready to step up and take care or even help in the slightest.  The group felt that it was only right that those who have paid their dues their whole lives are afforded the care they deserve.  The group felt that the government has a responsibility to provide a safety net for the elderly and that they should be provided with the care they need.

Many decent hard working people and their families won't be able to afford or provide good quality care for elderly relatives so it's only right that those who have paid their dues their whole lives are afforded the care they deserve.
