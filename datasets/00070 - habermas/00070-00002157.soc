# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: It is acceptable to eat meat, but we could all cut down on our consumption to help the environment, and to treat animals better
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the consumption of meat. We recognised that there are some issues with the industry, such as animal welfare and the environment, however we believe that these are issues that should be tackled by the industry and government, rather than by individuals. We also believe that people should have the freedom to choose what they eat, and therefore believe that it is acceptable to eat meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that the consumption of meat is acceptable. We are omnivores and meat has been part of our diet for thousands of years. We recognise that the way in which meat is produced can be harmful to the environment and to the animals themselves, however we believe that this is something that can be changed through policy. We believe that it is not necessary to stop the consumption of meat, however it is important to recognise the impact of the meat industry and to make changes where necessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I think it is acceptable to eat meat as this as been the case for many thousands of years, however we know a lot more about nutrition now, so there are alternatives that provide the nutrients, etc, that we need on a regular basis. So whilst I consider it acceptable to eat meat, I also agree that we could at minimum significantly cut down, in order to, amongst other things, help the environment and do less harm to animals.
