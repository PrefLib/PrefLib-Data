# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children under 13 should not be allowed to use social media. The reasons for this are as follows: The algorithms of social media platforms are not transparent and so we cannot be sure that children are not being exposed to harmful content. Furthermore, children are impressionable and easily led and so are more likely to be harmed by such content. Children also do not have the critical thinking skills necessary to protect themselves from predatory adults.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed to use social media. Social media is not a healthy environment for a developing mind and children are not yet able to understand the dangers that lurk in the world of social media. Children are impressionable and easily influenced, which makes them particularly vulnerable to the harmful content on social media. It is the responsibility of parents and guardians to protect children from the dangers of the world, including the dangers of social media. The participants also believe that it is the responsibility of social media platforms to implement age-access barriers in order to protect children from accessing their platforms.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While the many dangers of social media are well-known, there are significant benefits to a social media presence for children and young adults, and a blanket ban on use by under 13s could do more harm than good. Instead, a better approach is to give children and parents the tools and information necessary to stay safe online, while allowing the child to access social media if they want to. This means a better, more robust approach to parental controls, age verification, and algorithms that are designed to protect children. Until such measures are put in place, social media companies should be fined for not protecting children from predatory content and behaviours.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children under 13 should not be allowed to use social media.
