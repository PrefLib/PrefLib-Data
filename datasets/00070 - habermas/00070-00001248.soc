# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In principle, the government should ban the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad, however, the issue is more complex than that and it is not as simple as banning the sale of these products. In reality, it would be very difficult to enforce and monitor such a ban and companies would simply sell their products to other countries. It is also difficult to decide what is an underpaid worker and what is a fair wage in different countries. Therefore, it would be better to intervene with global policy and get all countries to increase standards of production. This would be difficult and would require a great deal of effort and co-operation between countries but it is a more appropriate and useful way to address the issue of underpaid workers abroad.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In principle, the government should ban the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad, however, the issue is more complex than that and it is not as simple as banning the sale of these products. In reality, it would be very difficult to enforce and monitor such a ban and companies would simply sell their products to other countries. It is also difficult to decide what is an underpaid worker and what is a fair wage in different countries. Therefore, it would be better to intervene with global policy and get all countries to increase standards of production. The best way to do this would be to encourage and pressure other countries to develop their own labour laws, which are similar to those of the United Kingdom.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In principle, the government should ban the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad. However, it is not a simple or straight-forward problem, and implementing such a ban may not be the best solution, and may be hard to actually enforce. It is complex to decide what is an underpaid worker and what is a fair wage in different countries and what a fair wage should be. Also, it would mean companies would simply sell their products to other countries rather than working with the government to improve the wages of their workers. Therefore, it would be better to intervene with global policy and get all countries to agree on increasing the standards of production of workers, rather than simply banning the sale of goods in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In principle, the government should ban the sale of products made by underpaid workers abroad, because it is unfair that the workers are underpaid and the government should force companies that operate in the United Kingdom to pay their workers a decent wage. However, the issue is more complex than that and it is not as simple as banning the sale of these products. It would be very difficult to enforce and monitor such a ban and companies would simply sell their products to other countries. It is also difficult to decide what is an underpaid worker and what is a fair wage in different countries. Therefore, it would be better to intervene with global policy and get all countries to increase standards of production.
