# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the teaching of creationism in schools is not a bad thing. However, it is important that it is taught in a balanced way and alongside other theories. It is important that children are aware of other people's beliefs and opinions, and it is good for them to be able to make their own informed opinions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although it is important to be aware of creationism and to learn about it in school, it should not be taught as scientific fact and instead it should be taught as an alternative view, so that children can make up their own minds on how they believe the world was created.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the teaching of creationism in schools is a bad thing. The idea of creationism is outdated and it is important that children are taught the scientific facts of how we came to be here. It is important to teach children the facts of how we came to be here, rather than the idea that we were created by a higher power. However, it is important that children are taught about all religions and beliefs, and creationism should be taught in this context, rather than as a scientific fact.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We have come to the consensus that teaching creationism in schools is a bad thing because it limits the potential to express scientific ideas and ways of thinking about the origins of life and the world. The belief in creationism contradicts with science which shows the facts of the development of humans through evolution. We believe that the teaching of creationism in schools can limit how people are able to think about their existence. However, we do believe that it is a valuable and valid belief and can be used in conjunction with scientific facts to develop ideas of how people may be able to view the development of the world and their existence. We believe that the teaching of creationism should not be pushed onto children and that they should be taught the scientific facts of how we came to be through evolution. This would allow children to develop their own views of the world, and how they came to be. It is important that children are taught creationism alongside evolution to allow them to develop their own understanding of the world.
