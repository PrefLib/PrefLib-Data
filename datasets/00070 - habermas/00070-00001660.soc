# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We do not think that parents should be able to genetically modify their unborn children. We feel that it is unnatural and it could lead to a number of issues in society in the future. We feel that it is wrong to be able to choose how your child will look or behave and that it is morally wrong to do this. We feel that it is a form of eugenics and that it could lead to unleashing a tidal wave of racism, homophobia, and other problematic things, as who decides what is 'desirable' to be like anyway? Very wrong. We would only consider it okay, in the case of very serious health conditions, but even then, should we be 'playing God'? It feels like a slippery slope we should not even approach.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We think it is very unethical for parents to be able to genetically modify their unborn children to have desired characteristics. We think this is because of the very serious consequences it could have for humanity, in the future. It could open the floodgates to racism, homophobia, sexism, or other discrimination. We also think it is unethical because it is not natural, and not everyone has the same desired characteristics, and this could be a cause of major discrimination.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, parents should not be able to have their unborn children genetically modified to have desired characteristics. We think it is unnatural and could lead to discrimination in society. However, we think it could be acceptable in the case of very serious health conditions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I don't think it is moral to modify an embryo before it is planted.
