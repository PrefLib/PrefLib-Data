# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - I am a bit indifferent on this. But I would lean on introducing a small new tax. People make a lot of money (Influencers) out of posting, and if they are paying for promoting posts on social media, then social media companies should be taxed on this. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - I think this should be implemented as social media has boomed in the last half a decade, especially after the COVID lockdowns. There are only a few companies that monopolise the market, and they earn a substancial amount for the market. Not only this but due to rises in new technology, it should be considered to be one of the biggest sectors of business. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I really dont know a lot about this subject.  However, I believe they are already paying corporation tax.  They are making a lot of money and therefore I guess the government would like to introduce a new tax on them.  I think rather than introduce a new tax, social media companies should be made to become more accountable on what is on their social media platform and held to account in monetary terms with the use of fines.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Social media has exploded in the last decade. It is used by many as the primary means for communicating their views, desires and thoughts on everything, whether that view is correct, or even wanted by others. Celebrities and influencers especially use this as a means to progress their views on topics with the expectation that their loyal fans with support their views. It can often be used as a platform to throw hate or abuse at others and to stalk or 'follow' in an unwanted way. I think that a tax on how social media is used will help form legislation to ensure that those companies are held to task on how they monitor and police their sites and make sure it is used in the future in a way that only benefits the users without the negative side.
