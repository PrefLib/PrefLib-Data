# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, the sale of alcoholic beverages should not be banned. Alcohol is a product that the majority of people purchase and enjoy and its sale should not be banned under any circumstances. The alcoholic beverages industry employs tens of thousands of people and banning its sale would have a huge impact on the economy. Moreover, there are many more people employed in sectors that are reliant on the sale of alcohol. In a free market, you cannot and should not be allowed to remove the sale of a product, unless it poses an significant and hitherto unknown risk to the public. Whether or not I oersonally choose to purchase alcohol is inconsequential to my view on this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While alcohol abuse is a serious problem that affects many families and individuals, the majority of people who consume alcohol do so responsibly and banning the sale of alcohol would create more problems than it would solve. There is a range of measures that could be taken to reduce alcohol-related harm, such as more rigorous age verification procedures, increasing the tax on alcohol, and limiting the times at which alcohol can be purchased. However, banning the sale of alcohol would impact negatively on the majority of law-abiding citizens and would be an unwarranted and disproportionate reaction to the problem of alcohol abuse.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we should not ban the sale of all alcoholic beverages. Alcohol is enjoyed by the majority of people in the UK and is a part of many celebrations and social occasions. The sale of alcohol is a huge industry in the UK and banning its sale would have a huge impact on the economy. Moreover, there are many more people employed in sectors that are reliant on the sale of alcohol. In a free market, you cannot and should not be allowed to remove the sale of a product, unless it poses an significant and hitherto unknown risk to the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although there are a number of negative consequences related to alcohol consumption, we do not believe that a complete ban of the sale of alcoholic beverages is an appropriate solution. There are numerous benefits to drinking alcohol responsibly, which outweigh the negative effects of excessive drinking. The complete banning of alcoholic beverages would have drastic effects on the economy, causing major job losses and a huge financial burden on the government. We believe that more regulation could be put in place to limit the harmful effects of alcohol.
