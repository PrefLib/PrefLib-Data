# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People should be allowed to live off the grid. This is their right and they should be free to do so. However, this comes with consequences. If they choose to live off the grid then they are choosing to live a life separate from the rest of society. They are choosing to not pay tax and therefore will not have access to the same public services as the rest of society. They are also choosing to not have any form of official documentation and therefore will not be able to prove their identity. This means that they will not be able to use services that require this form of identification. This means that they will not be able to use services such as banks, and may have difficulty accessing medical care. This is their choice, and they are free to make it, but they must accept the consequences of their choice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should be allowed to live off the grid. People should be allowed to make their own choices, and if they do not wish to interact with the outside world, that should be their choice. There is nothing wrong with it. However, some regulations need to be in place to ensure that living off the grid does not cause issues for other people. For example, basic health and safety needs to be in place, and proper sewage control needs to be put in place. It is also important to ensure that the location of the off-grid property does not cause a problem for the surrounding areas. For example, if a property is not maintained, it could cause a risk to the surrounding area in the event of a fire, or if animals escape from it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: People should be allowed to live off the grid. The reasons behind this being the fact that as long as they are not harming anyone and are happy living their lives in this manner, then there is no need to change that. Some people don't want to have their lives governed by the law, the government, the press, or by large organisations and therefore it is best to let them continue their lives in this manner. People can have their own thoughts and opinions and so this can be used to make the decision on their own lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should be allowed to live off the grid. They should not be allowed to live in a way that will cause harm to themselves or others. For example, if they live in a way that will cause harm to their health, they should be able to receive medical treatment and if they are causing a nuisance to others they should be asked to move on. They should be allowed to live in a way that does not cause harm to others.
