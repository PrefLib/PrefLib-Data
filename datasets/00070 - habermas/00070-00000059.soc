# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Capitalism has the potential to be a great system that promotes freedom and gives people the chance to do what they want, but it is also a system that can keep people down if they are not able to adapt. In many cases, capitalism is a tool that people can use to achieve great things in their life, but it can also keep people in an unhappy state of mind.  Conclusion: By allowing a group of individuals to give their opinions and critique each others' opinions on a topic, you can then come to a consensus statement that takes into account all opinions and critiques. The final consensus statement that is created is one that you can say everyone in the group agrees with, or at least is more representative of the majority opinion. This could be a useful tool for gaining the consensus opinion on a specific topic from a group of individuals, and is a way to overcome some of the inherent problems with polling methods that are currently used.
