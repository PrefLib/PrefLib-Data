# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, while we recognise the benefits of lowering the maximum legal speed limit to 60mph, it is likely to be detrimental in many respects. While we do acknowledge that it will lower emissions and therefore help to combat climate change, we believe that the benefits do not outweigh the cons of the change. Reducing the speed limit to 60mph is likely to cause congestion on motorways and lead to people becoming agitated, this can cause an increase in accidents due to road rage. We are also concerned that it will reduce the quality of life of people who live close to motorways as the reduction in speed will lead to louder noise. The economic benefits of the increase in speed limit will also be lost. The revenue gained from speeding fines has helped to maintain the roads. However, a reduction in the speed limit is likely to lead to a decrease in the amount of speeding fines, which will lead to a decrease in the money available for maintaining the roads. We believe that the benefits of keeping the speed limit as it is far outweigh the cons.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of lowering the speed limit to 60mph. However, the group did not think that this should be a blanket reduction and that there should be some exceptions to the rule. For example, the group thought that motorways should be exempt from the speed limit reduction, as these are designed to accommodate higher speeds. The group also thought that the speed limit should be raised to 70mph on dual carriageways, as these are generally more dangerous than motorways. The group thought that these exceptions would help to reduce congestion on the roads and make journeys more efficient.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Speed limits should be lowered from 70mph to 60mph on main roads to reduce noise and pollution and to improve safety.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the maximum legal speed for cars should be lowered from 70mph to 60mph. This would reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on the road, as well as reducing the amount of noise pollution in residential areas. However, it is important to note that this should not be considered a top priority issue, and, if discussed in parliament, perhaps a solution where the limit is lowered under certain conditions but not others would be a good idea.
