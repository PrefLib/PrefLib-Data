# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the current system is fine. We should not make the parliamentary term longer. We have seen a huge level of incompetence and corruption from the recent government. They should not be allowed to lock themselves into power for so long. The public should be able to vote them out even sooner.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the idea of a single six-year term is a bad idea as it will lead to complacency and corruption. In particular, the recent government has been incompetent and should not be allowed to lock themselves into power for so long.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the current term is sufficient for a government to make the necessary changes and to see if they are effective and then to be judged on those changes by the electorate. However, there is a strong argument that the current term is too short to allow a government to make the necessary changes and to see if they are effective and then to be judged on those changes by the electorate. Therefore, the current term should be increased to six years, with the proviso that a government can be recalled by the electorate if they are not satisfied with the government's performance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the current system of government works well. It would be difficult to change the system and would create more problems than it would solve. There is no pressing need to change the system.
