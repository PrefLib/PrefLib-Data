# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final statement: We have developed this consensus statement on the taxation of diesel vehicles because people are increasingly frustrated with their carbon footprint and we feel the government should encourage people to drive less polluting vehicles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We agree that diesel vehicles are less efficient than other fuel sources and produce more pollutants. We would therefore consider taxing diesel vehicles higher than other fuel sources as a way to encourage the use of more efficient vehicles. However, it is unfair to impose a higher tax on existing vehicles. Furthermore, if there are existing laws in place that force consumers to purchase diesel rather than petrol cars due to emission standards then consumers should be entitled to lower taxes on diesel cars to offset the extra costs they have incurred. New vehicles that have an efficient alternative fuel source should be incentivised, and should be taxed lower than diesel cars.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We agree that diesel vehicles are less efficient than other fuel sources and produce more pollutants. We would therefore consider taxing diesel vehicles higher than other fuel sources as a way to encourage the use of more efficient vehicles. However, it is unfair to impose a higher tax on existing vehicles and we feel that new vehicles that have an efficient alternative fuel source should be incentivised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There is a strong argument that diesel vehicles produce higher levels of pollutants, should be taxed higher than other vehicles, and that there should be incentives for vehicles that use more efficient fuel sources. This view takes into account the fairness of taxing existing vehicles and was agreed upon by all participants.
