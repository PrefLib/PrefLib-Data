# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There should be a tax system that ensures everyone pays their fair share. This means that those who are more wealthy should pay more tax. The current tax system is not working and it does not provide a level playing field for all. Some people with higher salaries are taxed at a higher rate, but there are also many people who have a lot of money, but who do not pay any tax at all. The tax system needs to be changed so that everyone pays their fair share.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There are many people in society who do not pay their fair share of tax. Some of these people are very wealthy and can afford to pay more tax, but some of these people are not wealthy at all and should not be paying tax. There needs to be a level playing field for all. The current tax system does not provide this and needs to be changed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People with more money should pay more taxes. The current tax system is not working and it does not provide a level playing field for all. Some people with higher salaries are taxed at a higher rate, but there are also many people who have a lot of money, but who do not pay any tax at all. The tax system needs to be changed so that everyone pays their fair share.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a more level playing field for all when it comes to taxation. People with more money should be taxed more, and those who have a lot of money but do not pay any tax should be taxed on their assets. The current tax system is not working and it does not provide a level playing field for all. Some people with higher salaries are taxed at a higher rate, but there are also many people who have a lot of money, but who do not pay any tax at all. The tax system needs to be changed so that everyone pays their fair share.
