# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing taxes for people who have three cars. However, it was agreed that there are some exceptions to this, for example, if the cars are used for work purposes, or if the cars are used by different members of the family. It was also agreed that the increase in tax should not be too much, and that it should be enough to discourage people from having three cars, but not enough to make it impossible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should increase taxes for people who have three cars, unless they are all electric cars, or if they are all used for work purposes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should increase taxes for people that have three cars. My reason for this is that usually families have one or two cars, three would be seen as a vanity purchase, or unnecessary. For people that are single, three cars would also be seen as an unnecessary amount of cars which would require a decent amount of cash flow to buy/maintain. I think the tax increase should not apply if the third vehicle is used for work purposes, for example: a van or digger.
