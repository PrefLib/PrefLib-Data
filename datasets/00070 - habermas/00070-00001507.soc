# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Businesses should be encouraged to provide a private space for breastfeeding mothers, but in cases where it is not practical or possible to do this e.g. a driving instructor, employers should respect mothers' right to feed their baby in the location they feel most comfortable. Discussion
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Businesses should be obliged to provide a private space for breastfeeding mothers where it is practical to do so. This is a matter of basic hygiene and most employers would want to do this anyway as they should be looking to create an environment where all staff feel comfortable. While it may not always be practical, e.g. a one man band driving instructor, in the majority of cases it should be possible to create a suitable space, e.g. a break room. The mother should have the option to choose if they want to use the space and it should be a place where the mother can feel safe and confident.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Businesses should be encouraged to provide a private space for breastfeeding mothers, but should not be obliged to do so. This is because it may not be practical for all businesses to do so. The space should be clean and comfortable, and a place where the mother can feel safe and confident.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe businesses should be obliged to provide a private space for breastfeeding mothers. It is the right of mothers to have access to a clean hygienic space to feed their child and women should not be expected to feed their child in a toilet. It is of course practical to create a space that allows for privacy in the majority of cases. The mother should have the option to use this space if she so chooses and it should be a place that allows the mother to feel safe and confident.
