# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “Although the notion that we should “ban all things with plastic packaging” may seem simple, there are many problems with doing so.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is widely accepted that we use too much plastic in packaging and this is a large cause of environmental damage. There is an urgent need to find alternatives to plastic packaging as plastic takes a very long time to degrade and therefore we are seeing it in our oceans and other natural environments. However, I feel that this is a huge issue and we need to find the most effective way to stop this. Although I understand there are alternatives to plastic, I feel that banning the sale of items with plastic packaging will be counterproductive. As Participant 4 said, some items need plastic packaging to stay fresh or even safe. I believe that we need to make changes, however we need to find the most effective ways to do this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: It is widely accepted that we use too much plastic in packaging and this is a large cause of environmental damage. However, we think that banning all items with plastic packaging is not the most effective way to stop the problem. We understand there are alternatives to plastic, such as paper and cardboard, however I feel these materials would be too weak to be effective. Although we must make changes, we feel we must find the most effective ways to do this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is widely accepted that we use too much plastic in packaging and this is a large cause of environmental damage. However, I feel that this is a huge issue and we need to find the most effective way to stop this. Although I understand there are alternatives to plastic, I feel that banning the sale of items with plastic packaging will be counterproductive. There are some products that need plastic packaging to stay fresh or even safe. I believe that we need to make changes, however we need to find the most effective ways to do this. This is important because the issue of using too much plastic is getting worse and worse. We all need to work together to stop this. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
