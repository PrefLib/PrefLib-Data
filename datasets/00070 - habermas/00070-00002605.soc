# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: hunting for sport has been a decade of tradition. hunting for sport doesnt really affect me as its not really something i ever think about so in that way i guess my blind ignorance may say yes its ok.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No it bloody isn't, it's cruel and unneeded. it's a vile past time and should be ended straight away. Some traditions should be ended and should not be used as an excuse to why they should carry on.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I do not believe it is OK for people to hunt purely for sport. Hunting should be done only if it necessary for food, or for an ecological reason such as population reduction or control. There are many other ways that sport hunters can fulfil their need to shoot animals without actually having to kill one, such as target shooting, clay pigeon shooting etc. I cannot see a valid reason to kill an animal for fun.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Absolutely not, its cruelty to animals for the pleasure of humans slaying animals. Its disgusting and shouldn't even be a question needed to be asked.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Absolutely never, why should humans feel it's okay to take a life for the sole reason of it being a 'sport'. Innocent animals are killed all the time and for what? So you can brag to your friends later on? It makes absolutely no sense how or why you would get a kick out of hunting as a sport
