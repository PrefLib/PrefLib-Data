# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is a moral obligation for the British government to support international development. The British government has contributed to the poverty of many countries through slavery and colonisation. The government has also tried to turn British people against immigrants and to blame all the problems on immigration when it is their policies that have caused standard of living to go down for ordinary working people. The British government is a developed nation, so it is vital that all developed nations support those who are less developed. Ethically, we have a responsibility to ensure that all people have access to vital services as supporting international development allows us to do this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The British government does have a moral obligation to support international development. The government has a duty to support those who are less fortunate and to provide aid where it is needed. The government has a duty to support international development as they have contributed to the poverty of the poorer countries through slavery and colonisation therefore they have a moral obligation to right the wrongs they have done. The British invaded many countries in their long history and now have a moral obligation to other countries who have not been as fortunate due to wars or other issues beyond their control. The government has actually tried to turn british people against immigrants and to blame all the problems on immigration when it is their policies that have caused standard of living to go down for ordinary working people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, the British government has a moral obligation to support international development. This is because, firstly, the British government has contributed to the poverty of the poorer countries through slavery and colonisation therefore they have a moral obligation to right the wrongs they have done. Secondly, all countries have some moral obligation to support international development, so therefore, the British government does also. International development is important on many levels, both in advancement of technologies and other sciences, to help fight global battles such as global warming, or pandemics. But also because international development, forces countries to keep advancing further, improving the lives of all. The other reason that the British government has a moral obligation to support such development, is because Britain is a developed nation, so it is vital that all developed nations support those who are less developed. Ethically, we have a responsibility to ensure that all people have access to vital services as supporting international development allows us to do this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The British government does have a moral obligation to support international development. We have a duty to help other countries, who have not been as fortunate as us, due to wars or other issues beyond their control. We have invaded many countries in our long history and now have a moral obligation to support them. The British government has actually tried to turn British people against immigrants and to blame all the problems on immigration when it is their policies that have caused standard of living to go down for ordinary working people. The British government does have a moral obligation to support international development. We have far more than we need in this country and a lot of people have come to think of many luxuries as their 'right'. There are many countries that could use some of our money and resources to help support basic human needs, needs wants. There is some obligation to support development and if it is done effectively then it can aid the British economy and trade relationships. What needs to be considered is value of money being directed to other countries rather than fixing the many issues that have arisen in this country, such as crime, poverty, equality and standard of living. Helping developing other countries can provide a gateway to positive immigration and a pathway for a better life for inhabitants of those countries
