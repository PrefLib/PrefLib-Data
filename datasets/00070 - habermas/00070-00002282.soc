# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that the government should tax sugary drinks. We believe that people should be free to make their own choices, but that the government has a duty to protect its citizens from making choices that will harm them. We also believe that a tax on sugary drinks will help to reduce the number of people who suffer from obesity and diabetes, which will reduce the strain on the NHS. We also believe that the tax will help to reduce the number of people who suffer from poor dental health. We believe that the tax will be effective in reducing consumption of sugary drinks, as it will make them more expensive, and that this will lead to a healthier population.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of a tax on sugary drinks. The group felt that this would help reduce the amount of sugar consumed by the population, and would also help to reduce the amount of sugar-related health issues such as obesity and diabetes. The group felt that the tax would be a good way to help people make healthier choices, and would also help to reduce the strain on the NHS. The group also felt that the tax would be a good way to raise money for the government, which could be used to help fund the NHS and other public services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of a sugar tax, but with the caveat that it would not be the only policy measure used to reduce sugar consumption. The group was in favour of a tax on sugary drinks, but felt that this would not be enough to reduce sugar consumption, and that the government should also consider taxing other sugary foods. The group felt that the tax should be high enough to make a difference, but not so high that it would cause people to switch to other unhealthy foods or drinks. The group felt that the tax should be used to fund public health initiatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of a sugar tax. We all agreed that sugary drinks can be partly responsible for poor dental health and obesity, leading to other health issues such as diabetes. We also agreed that the government should not try and control our choices, but that the effects of sugar put a big strain on the NHS. Therefore, we believe that taxing sugary drinks would discourage people from buying them and hopefully lead to them making better choices. However, we also believe that the tax should be used to improve dental health and to provide education on the dangers of sugar.
