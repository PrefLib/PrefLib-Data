# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of free healthcare.  However, there was a feeling that this should be for serious health conditions and not for cosmetic/aesthetic reasons.  It was also felt that this should be funded by taxation, with those that earn the most contributing the most.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: All healthcare should be free. This should be funded by taxation - with those that earn the most contributing the most.  This would ensure that all citizens have access to healthcare regardless of their financial situation.  It would also prevent people from having to sell their homes or go into debt to pay for their healthcare.  This would also prevent people from not seeking healthcare because they cannot afford it, which could result in them becoming seriously ill and having to be hospitalised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Healthcare should be free for all citizens and paid for through taxes. Healthcare should not be means tested, and the more one earns, the more tax they should pay. It should include life-saving procedures and treatments, and should be provided by the state in order to ensure that nobody misses out. It should not be means tested.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: While healthcare in itself is a very broad term, we believe that there should be an absolute minimum level of care that should be freely available to everyone. We believe that this should be a basic minimum level of care and treatment, for medical reasons only, but it should be freely available to everyone. A set standard of basic healthcare, paid for by the government through taxation and not through private means, should be a human right and should not be given only to those who can afford it.
