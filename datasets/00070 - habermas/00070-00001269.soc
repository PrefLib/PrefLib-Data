# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the minimum wage should be raised. The cost of living has increased significantly in recent years, and the minimum wage has not kept up with this. This has led to many people struggling to afford the basics. Raising the minimum wage would help to alleviate this. However, this should be done in conjunction with other measures, such as a Universal Basic Income, to ensure that the poorest in society are not left behind.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While the Government are aware that they cannot prevent people from living in poverty, they should not be complacent in the face of the rising numbers of people living in poverty. The government should introduce a statutory increase to the minimum wage. The increase should be sufficient to at least keep up with the rate of inflation. This should be done in conjunction with welfare reforms, rather than instead of them. It is likely that a large increase to the minimum wage will result in job losses and price rises, which will counteract the positive effect on people's living standards. A smaller, regular increase to the minimum wage would be more effective in lifting people out of poverty without adversely affecting the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The minimum wage should be raised. The cost of living and just the cost of everything has gone up, the minimum wage should be at least double what it is just now especially supermarket staff! I am personally delighted to see that some of the participants were able to agree to raise the minimum wage, even if the degree to which it should be raised was debated. The below example presents a typical election survey where participants are presented with questions and a range of options to choose from. This is an example of where reaching a consensus was not possible, and in some cases the wording of the question has been rephrased to better reflect the participant's responses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the minimum wage should be raised. However, it is important to note that there are various different perspectives on this topic. The cost of living is increasing, and therefore a higher minimum wage is needed to help those who are struggling to survive. On the other hand, some businesses may find it difficult to cope with an increase in the minimum wage, especially in the current economic climate. The minimum wage should be increased in a way that is fair to all parties involved.
