# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, a full English breakfast is better than a continental breakfast. It is more filling and can be a more enjoyable meal. However, it is not necessarily a healthy option. A continental breakfast can be better in some situations, especially if you want something lighter.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A full English breakfast is better than a continental breakfast. It is more filling, more nutritious and is therefore better on most cold mornings. However, it is important to note that the English breakfast is seen as unhealthy and therefore it is not something to have often but a good treat once in a while.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, a full English breakfast is better than a continental breakfast. This is because a full English breakfast is more filling, can be healthier depending on how it is cooked and is therefore better on most cold mornings.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, a full English breakfast is better than a continental breakfast. It is more filling and contains more variety. It is also hot which is better for most cold mornings. A continental breakfast is lighter and can be prepared quicker but it is less filling. It is also seen as healthier but can actually be relatively healthy depending on how things are cooked.
