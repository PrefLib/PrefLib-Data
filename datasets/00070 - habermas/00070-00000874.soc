Consider the cases and prosecution that lead to conviction for sexual assault. Its less than 1%. Thats a huge issue that is left unaddressed by governments and institutions whilst victims, mostly women are being killed and traumatised without anyone to turn to.

While there is definitely inequality in the UK I feel like we're one of the fairest countries in the world when it comes to this question. For the size of our GDP there aren't that many billionaires which suggests to me that they're forced to give up more here than in other places with a similar economy. Yes I would say there is , we have some people who get given everything and have contributed nothing, couples without children and especially single people are completely penalised. To much is given to migrants, not enough is given to those in need who already live here. I think there is always inequality everywhere and the UK is no different.
