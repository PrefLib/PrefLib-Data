# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The right to protest is an important part of a functioning democracy. It is especially important for minorities, who often do not have the same voice as the majority. There are some circumstances, however, where the government should be able to ban public protests. The first is if the protests are led by right-wing authoritarian groups, who can then spread hate to minority groups and create chaos, if not being overseen by the police. The second is if the protests itself poses a risk to the people involved - fire hazards, security hazards, the threat of terroristic actions and a possible stampede happening. The third is if the protests cause a significant disruption to the lives of ordinary people. For example, climate change protests have been known to block roads, preventing ambulances getting through and stopping people from getting to work (doing roles that may cause significant security or safety issues, if they were not in work).
