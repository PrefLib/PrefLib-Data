# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I don't necessarily feel that strongly about this topic either way as I generally avoid sugary drinks. Despite this, I believe raising it is not enough of a deterrent for people to purchase it. I believe a more effective method of reducing obesity would be through improved education on the topic of nutrition and health.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I think we should tax sugar.  Taxing alcohol in Scotland with a minimum unit price has brough health benefits and it seems that the same would happen with sugar and obesity.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, I don't think that we should increase taxes on sugar sweetened drinks. People have freedom of choice to buy sugar if they wish. Although I understand that a high sugar diet can cause health issues and put pressure on healthcare services, people should still have their freedom of choice. People who enjoy sugar sweetened drinks as part of a balanced diet should not be penalised because other people have no self control. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I think increasing tax on sugar sweetened drinks can be a good incentive to reduce sugar intake in the general population (similar to the increase in tax on alcohol in Scotland). However, I think it would be more effective to regulate from a top-down approach by taxing companies with excessive sugar more, and regulating the amount of sugar allowed in products. This way, consumers (some of which may be poor and have addictions) are not held responsible for corporations dangerous practices
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I would be in favour of this if I knew that the increased revenue was spent on healthcare and better eduation around nutrition.
