# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the infrastructure of the UK is in a poor state. This is down to years of neglect and austerity policies, which have lead to a large backlog of work to be done. However, the labour force of the UK is already overstretched and will not be able to meet the demands of the government in the near future. In this instance, it is vital for the government to allow overseas companies to bid for contracts in the UK. These overseas companies will bring their own workers, which can be regulated in the same way UK workers are regulated.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Infrastructure projects are vital for the UK economy. It is vital that we have UK led projects to build up our economy and to create and sustain workforces all over the country. Therefore, the UK should ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We feel that the UK should ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. The reason for this is that the British economy is weak, and needs to strengthen. The UK has high unemployment, and overseas companies can bring their workers to the UK, causing more unemployment. The UK should not be encouraging this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of overseas companies bidding on infrastructure projects in the UK. The group felt that this would lead to more competition and therefore lead to a better quality of work and a lower cost for the UK. The group was also in favour of overseas companies bidding on infrastructure projects because they felt that this would lead to a greater exchange of ideas and expertise. The group was aware that this would lead to a loss of jobs for UK workers, but felt that this would be outweighed by the benefits to the UK as a whole.
