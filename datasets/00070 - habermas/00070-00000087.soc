# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Solar panels should be installed on new homes as it will increase the energy efficiency of the home and will reduce the energy bills. Solar panels should be installed as they are being built as it would be more cost effective than installing them later. The cost of solar panels needs to be looked at as it would not be financially viable to the homeowner if the cost was too high. The solar panels should generate the power prior to taking from the grid so that excess power can be given to the grid for others to use.  A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Participants first expressed their personal opinions on the question. Then, a first draft of a consensus statement was produced. Participants then provided a critique of the draft consensus statement. Finally, a final consensus statement was produced. Below is presented the question, the opinions of each individual participant, the first draft consensus statement, the critiques of the draft consensus statement, and the final consensus statement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: All new homes should be fitted with solar panels to save the homeowner money on their energy bills and to make their home more energy efficient. It will also help to provide the homeowner with a greener lifestyle and it would also future proof the home. The excess power generated would also benefit the National Grid.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of installing solar panels on new homes. They argued that as long as the cost is not prohibitive then it makes good sense to install solar panels in all new homes as it would future proof the homes and would increase the value of the property. It would also save on energy bills. It would also help the homeowner to have a more energy efficient home, which would reduce the impact of CO2 emissions and help the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Solar panels should be installed on all new homes. They should be installed on existing homes as well. The cost of installing solar panels should be financially supported by the government as they have a limited lifespan and are quite expensive to install. This will increase the value of the property, and will save on energy bills.
