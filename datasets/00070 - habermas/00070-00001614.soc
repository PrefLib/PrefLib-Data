# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex. It is not fair to charge different prices to different people and could lead to discrimination. It is not fair to charge more to certain people, especially if they are young and do not have a lot of money. It is also not fair to charge more to women, as this is sexist and could lead to a gender pay gap.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 -

We believe that this is discriminatory and therefore should not be allowed. We believe that it is not fair to charge different prices for the same product. We also believe that it is not fair to discriminate against a person because of their age or sex. We believe that it is not fair to treat a person differently because of their age or sex.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The practice of charging different prices for a product depending on the customer's age or sex is morally unacceptable. In the case of the age group, there should be some protection to ensure that young children are not given access to items that are not suitable for them and therefore the prices charged for these items should be set to make the item too expensive for them to purchase. In the case of gender, it is not morally acceptable to charge different prices for the same product, irrespective of the person's gender. This is just unfair discrimination. In both cases, the person should be able to purchase the same item as someone else for the same price, irrespective of age or sex.
