# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a danger that the private sector will distort the education system to suit its own agenda. The people who work in the private sector are successful because they are good at selling things, but education is not a product to be sold. The purpose of education is to emancipate children and help them to realise their full potential. If the private sector is allowed to have too much of a say in education, the danger is that it will change what children learn to suit its own ends.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There are undoubtedly people in the private sector who are very successful at what they do and who have great ideas about what works and what doesn't. The problem is that they are also interested in making money. We can't forget that the best way for someone to make money is to get people to buy what they sell. If we give the private sector too much power, there's a risk that the whole education system could be distorted so that it becomes more about selling products and services than actually educating the children who are in our schools. There may be a role for the private sector to play in education; this may be in the area of management, or in developing new curriculum, but we need to be very cautious to ensure that the system is not distorted to benefit certain businesses at the expense of the children.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The private sector should not play a greater role in education. Education is best performed by the state, in the interest of the state. We are concerned that if the private sector is given greater power, there's a risk that the whole education system could be distorted so that it becomes more about selling products and services than actually educating the children who are in our schools.   ________________________________________________________________________________________

However, we should not exclude the private sector from the education system entirely. Their skills and experience can be valuable for management, and the business community has a responsibility to help support the future generation of our society.
