# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of making public transport free but with some caveats. The group agreed that making public transport free would be a good thing for the environment, would reduce congestion and would increase accessibility for those who are vulnerable. However, the group felt that making public transport free would be an expensive endeavour, which would need to be funded by tax payers. The group felt that the government would need to increase taxes in order to fund it. The group felt that this would be unfair, as it would mean that tax payers would be paying for others to use public transport. The group also felt that making public transport free would not be viable, as it would put pressure on an already over-stretched system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should not require all public transport to be free. If it was not paid for by customers, the government would have to fund it using tax payer money. This would lead to increased taxes or lower spending in other more important areas. Whilst it would be beneficial to allow people to move around freely, we don't see how it would be practical. We should make it free for those who are vulnerable such as those with disabilities and chronic illnesses. Also, without income from fares the quality of the service might be compromised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the idea of making all public transport free is a good one. However, it would be too expensive and impractical to implement. It would also be unfair to tax payers who would have to pay for the service. Instead, we should make public transport free for people who are vulnerable such as those with disabilities and chronic illnesses. We should also look at ways to improve the public transport system to make it more accessible and affordable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the idea of making all public transport free is not a good idea. It would lead to a rise in taxes, an increase in government debt and could lead to a poorer quality of service. However, there are some exceptions to this. We believe that all public transport should be free for those who are vulnerable such as those with disabilities and chronic illnesses. This would allow them to get to where they need to go, without having to worry about paying.
