# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that we do not think it is okay to build a nuclear power plant next to a village.  This is because of the health implications for the residents, the risk of explosions and the damage to the environment.  We think that nuclear power plants should be built in industrial areas, away from villages and towns.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the conclusion that it is not okay to build a nuclear power plant next to a village. The main reason for this is because if there was to be a leak of radiation, the people who live in the village would be affected by it and it could have a very negative impact on their health. Another reason for this is because the nuclear power plant could cause a lot of pollution to the air and it could cause the people who live in the village to get ill. We also think that if the nuclear power plant was to be built, it could attract a lot of people to the village which could cause a lot of traffic and this could be a problem for the people who live in the village. We also think that it would be unfair on the people who live in the village because they would have to look at the nuclear power plant every day and this could cause them to become unhappy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, it is not okay to build a nuclear power plant next to a village. While nuclear power plants are a reliable source of energy, and the potential for disaster is very low, it is still not a good idea to build one next to a village. This is because the land is typically used for agriculture and building a nuclear power plant would be a waste of valuable land. There is also the issue of how the local people would feel about it, and whether it would be a good idea to build one in an area where the local people are against it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the conclusion that nuclear power plants are not safe enough to be built near villages. While they are a good source of energy and could combat climate change, if there is a leak or explosion, it could have severe consequences for the village and surrounding areas. If a nuclear power plant was to be built, it should be built far away from any villages or towns to ensure the safety of the people living there.
