# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We think that the UK should consider adopting a similar approach to the Universal Basic Income experiments that are currently running in Finland and the Netherlands. The rising cost of living is putting many people in poverty and struggling to meet their basic needs, and with automation of jobs, people are losing their jobs and means of income. A Universal Basic Income is one way of ensuring that all people, whether in work or out of work, can access the funds to ensure their basic needs are met. There are many benefits to this, such as increased quality of life, a reduced strain on the NHS and welfare services, and an increase in productivity and economic growth. We do think that more information on how the scheme works in these countries would be useful before making a decision. We would also like to ensure that the implementation of such a scheme is done so with an ethical code of conduct so that it doesn't lead to people falling into poverty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In principle, the UK should adopt a similar approach to the Universal Basic Income experiments that are currently running in Finland, and the Netherlands. However, the UK should wait for the results of these experiments before making a final decision.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - A Universal Basic Income is something that should be explored. It is a very different system to the one we currently have, and it is something that could help a lot of people who are struggling to get by. It could also help to reduce the amount of fraud in the benefits system, as it would be a flat rate payment to everyone. However, the cost of implementing this would be very high, and it is not something that should be rushed into. It would be good to see how the experiments in Finland and the Netherlands pan out, and then use this information to see if it would be a good idea to implement in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Whilst we recognise the value of UBI and understand it's potential in the future, we also acknowledge that it is currently too expensive for the UK to implement.
