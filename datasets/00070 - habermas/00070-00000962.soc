# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In principle, there should be a limit to the amount of fish people can catch for recreation. However, it is important to bear in mind that some recreational fishing is already regulated and some is not. In cases where recreational fishing is already regulated, the current limits are sufficient and should be maintained. In cases where recreational fishing is not currently regulated, we recommend that a limit should be set. The limit should be set at a level which ensures that the recreational fishing is sustainable and does not have a negative impact on the local environment. Following this process, the consensus opinion of all of the groups in the debate was as follows. In principle, there should be a limit to the amount of fish people can catch for recreation. However, it is important to bear in mind that some recreational fishing is already regulated and some is not. In cases where recreational fishing is already regulated, the current limits are sufficient and should be maintained. In cases where recreational fishing is not currently regulated, we recommend that a limit should be set. The limit should be set at a level which ensures that the recreational fishing is sustainable and does not have a negative impact on the local environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a limit to the amount of fish people can catch for recreation. We believe that the limit should be set at a level which ensures that the recreational fishing is sustainable and does not have a negative impact on the local environment. The limit should be set according to the current levels of fish in a particular water body. We recommend that people be allowed to catch fewer fish if the water body is understocked. In principle, there should be a limit to the amount of fish people can catch for recreation.

In addition to this, one participant added the following statement, reflecting the initial concern expressed by participant 1, that there are some fisheries which should not be recreational: There are however certain fisheries that do not require recreational limits, for example fisheries where invasive fish species are being caught for the purposes of improving biodiversity. These fisheries should be managed by means of scientific methods, and not require a limit on the number of fish caught by recreational fishers.
