# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should ban the use of non-biodegradable plastic. We should also ensure that all plastic packaging is recyclable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is important to acknowledge that there are arguments for and against plastic packaging, but it is also necessary to be mindful that biodegradable alternatives are widely available. There are also multiple other harmful effects on the environment and to wildlife of non-biodegradable plastic. Hence, we agree that non-biodegradable plastic should be banned.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the use of non-biodegradable plastic should be banned. However, there may be the odd occasion when it is necessary. We should be looking at getting alternatives for everything. Recyclable materials should be standard in all consumer products. If other packaging can be used that is more environmentally friendly then, why not use it? The oceans are full of this rubbish and we need to stop producing it now. Some companies can do better then they are at the moment and need to take a good look at their packaging. I understand that single use and non biodegradable plastics and suchlike are very convenient but they are harming the planet. They should be banned so that people and animals do not do further damage. non biodegradable plastic has a huge negative impact on our environment so i think they should be banned. there are so many other alternatives now that means we do not have to use non biodegradable plastic that this shouldnt even be a question.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, we should ban non-biodegradable plastics because we need to look after the planet and our animals and future generations.
