# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is a strong argument for both sides, but on balance the Royal family are a net positive for society. They are a symbol of unity for the country, and are a source of pride for many people. They also generate a large amount of tourism to the UK and are a large part of our culture and heritage. However, the large amount of money they receive from the government is a large amount of money that could be spent on other things. Also, some of the things they have said and done in the past have been very controversial, and this has damaged the reputation of the Royal family.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the royal family is a net positive for society. They provide a sense of national pride for the country, and also act as a tourist attraction which brings in a large amount of money for the country. However, they also come with a large cost. This cost is not only in terms of money, but also in terms of a sense of inequality in the country. The royal family is a symbol of the class system in the UK, and this is something that a lot of people are not happy about. The royal family is also not representative of the people of the UK, as they are predominantly white and do not represent the ethnic diversity of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the Royal family is a net positive for society. This is because they bring in a large amount of tourism to the UK and they are also a large part of our culture and heritage. They are also a symbol of unity for the country, and are a source of pride for many people. However, there are some negatives to the Royal family. The large amount of money they receive from the government is a large amount of money that could be spent on other things. Also, some of the things they have said and done in the past have been very controversial, and this has damaged the reputation of the Royal family.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The Royal Family is a net positive for society, the tourism that they generate is a significant income for the country. Also, the Royal family is a large part of British culture and history, and is something that we should be proud of. However, the Royal family needs to modernise, and needs to be more open to the public, and less secretive. The Royal family should also be more diverse and less white, and should represent the whole of society.
