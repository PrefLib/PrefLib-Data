# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: A degree is an important qualification to have. However, not all professions necessitate a degree. Encouraging everyone to pursue a degree might undervalue other careers and lead to an oversupply of degree holders with insufficient job opportunities to match. Apprenticeships are a good way forward, as people will be paid to learn a job. However, making it easier for everyone that wants to study further to get a degree to be able to do so is also important.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should encourage people to get a degree, but we should also make it clear that it is not the only option.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should encourage everyone to get a degree, but not everyone is suited to the university environment and this is to be respected.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Whilst a degree is an important qualification to have, some lines of work do not require degrees, rather they require 'qualifications' such as a plumber, electrical engineer or electrician or other 'trades' - these are essential areas of the economy and thus if everyone had a degree, we'd have an even greater shortfall in key workers for the benefit of society and to keep inflation in check. Firstly, not all professions necessitate a formal degree. Many successful individuals have found their paths without obtaining a degree. Trades and technical occupations for instance can be learnt through apprenticeships and vocational training which provide hands-on experience and direct pathways to jobs. Encouraging everyone to pursue a degree might undervalue these careers and lead to an oversupply of degree holders with insufficient job opportunities to match. Not everyone is capable of getting a degree and the dumbing down of degrees in recent years has devalued their worth. Apprenticeships are a much better way to go. No debts incurred and open to almost everybody. However saying that, I believe that we should make it easier for everyone that wants to study further to get a degree to be able to do so. Plus I do think that going to university
