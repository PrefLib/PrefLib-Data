# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think the government should not provide funding for high-speed rail lines between major cities.  As the world is at the moment the money could be spent on more urgent matters such as the cost of living.  What the government should do in my opinion is help make the railway services we already have operate properly and reliably.  Also encourage the public to use the railway system for environmental reasons by making tickets cheaper.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I am strongly for this as it won't just benefit people travelling to and from work + leisure places. If trains were quicker and became more reliable, it would entice people to use them more often. This would lead to many positive benefits such as reduced traffic congestion, improved transport efficiency, lower carbon emissions, and enhanced economic connectivity.   It would also reduce potential road accidents as more people would likely and hopefully commute via train. Finally, for people travelling to and from work, it would create a better quality of life as a lot of people spend a good amount of their day commuting. Therefore if there was a faster option, this would cut down on the commute time and people would therefore be happier.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think the government should provide the funding, especially up in the north. The failure of HS2 shows what the torys think of the north and it is a real disappointment what has happened. Funding for public transport should be at an all time high and high speed trains are an excellent form of transport. More funding should be allocated towards this to decrease the usage of vehicles and give the public more of an option when travelling. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The rail services in the UK are very poor so I think major improvements do need to be made. The government should provide funding for rail improvements however I think there are much more pressing issues to focus on first. The prices of train fares should be reduced or no one will be able to afford a high speed train ticket anyway. Rail improvements would help the economy and help with travel  as in comparison to other countries it is very poor. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Yes; I believe that the government should invest in public transport. This is in the interest of all citizens, as well as the global population due to the lower carbon emissions from greater use of public transport. The railways in the UK have been massively underfunded in recent years, and it should be the government's responsibility to improve them. It also shouldn't be a matter of profit; as a public utility, providing the best service without a profit motive ought to be the primary factor in how rail is run.
