# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - After a long debate, the group have come to a conclusion that we all agree on. In our opinion, there is an ethical duty to donate blood, bone marrow or organs. We all agree that it is a very important part of life to help people in need and if we are able to do so in the easiest way then it should be done.   Of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinions and this decision is no different. There is no pressure and people should never feel forced into doing something they are not happy with.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, we believe that it is a personal decision, however, we would like to think that if we needed help from an organ donor then we would hope someone else would donate theirs to us.  This makes us think that we would like to do the same.  We are happy to help in any way that we can. We also think that it is really important that people of all ages and races should consider donating blood as this could be the difference between life and death for many people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have a moral duty to consider to donate blood, bone marrow and organs.  We should not automatically be placed on the list for donating.  In order to provide a wider range of donors, the medical profession should make an effort to consider to inform all people about the donation process and the potential lifesaving benefits. The views expressed by the participants are those of the participants only and not those of anyone else associated with, or involved in, the project.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have an ethical duty to consider donating blood, bone marrow, or organs.
