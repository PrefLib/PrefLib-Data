# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While it is important for the UK to accept its fair share of immigrants in order to allow them to escape war and persecution, it should not accept more than is its fair share. The UK must bear in mind that it is a small country, and its infrastructure is under considerable pressure. The UK must therefore make sure that its own citizens are looked after, in terms of basic health, education and other services. If the UK accepts more than its fair share of immigrants, this may lead to greater numbers of poor and homeless, as well as a strain on infrastructure, leading to increased pressure on services such as housing and the NHS. If the UK is to accept more immigrants, it should focus on skilled immigrants, who are able to provide a valuable benefit to the country, rather than simply adding to the numbers of poor and homeless.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The UK should accept its fair share of immigrants. The UK is a small country and its infrastructure is already under considerable pressure. Therefore the UK should make sure that its own citizens are looked after, in terms of basic health, education and other services, before accepting immigrants. If the UK accepts more than its fair share of immigrants, this may lead to greater numbers of poor and homeless, as well as a strain on infrastructure, leading to increased pressure on services such as housing and the NHS.
