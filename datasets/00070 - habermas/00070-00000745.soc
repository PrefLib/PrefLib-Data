# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that the current voting system in the UK is outdated and should be changed. We believe that the UK should move towards a system of proportional representation. We also believe that voting should be made more accessible to people. We also think that the voting age should be lowered to 16.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of adopting a new system of voting in UK parliamentary elections. The current system is very outdated and unrepresentative of the population. A system that is based on proportional representation would be much more fair. The group also agreed that online voting would be a great way of making voting much more accessible to the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should adopt a new system of voting in UK parliamentary elections. The current system is outdated and is not representative of the population. There is a need for more proportional representation, and a fairer system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should adopt a new system of voting in UK parliamentary elections. At the moment, we use First Past the Post. The outcomes we gain from this system are often unrepresentative of the uk population. For example, one member of parliament may be elected by a large majority, but the area in which the mp was elected only has a small population. Conversely, If another mp is elected in a much larger constituency in terms of population, but only with a tiny majority, the large amount of the population who voted against this individual will not be properly represented. this means that political parties can succeed without having the majority share of the vote in many areas.
