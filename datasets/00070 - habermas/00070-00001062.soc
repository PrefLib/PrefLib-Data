# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We don’t believe that the UK should ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. However, we do believe that UK based companies should have first access to projects before foreign investments come in. We also believe that it is important that we are not bought off by countries such as China who do not have the people’s best interests at heart in investments. The government needs to deliver better infrastructure to grow the economy and provide opportunities for people across the country.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, I don't think they should ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects. I think that the UK should not close themselves off from other countries and the benefits that they can bring. However, I do think that the government should be careful about who they allow to bid on projects. They should be sure that the companies they allow to bid have the best interests of the UK and its people at heart.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Infrastructure is key to the success of the UK economy and it is important that we get it right. It is important that we use UK companies where possible to ensure that the money goes back into the UK economy and to support UK jobs. However, it is also important that we use the best companies for the job and if that is an overseas company, then they should be allowed to bid for the work. It is also important that we do not rule out overseas companies for the work as this could lead to legal action and could damage the reputation of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The group have come to the consensus view that we should not ban overseas companies from bidding on infrastructure projects, but the UK government should be careful and ensure that all infrastructure projects are carried out in a safe and sustainable way. It is important that all projects are run in a fair way and that a level playing field is provided for UK based companies to ensure they are not left out of the bidding process.
