# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Final consensus statement: In general, the teaching of creationism in schools is not a bad thing. It is important that it is taught in a balanced way with other theories so children are aware of all the views out there. It is not wrong to allow children to make their own informed opinions. But it is vital that it is also made clear to them that the scientific explanation is the actual explanation, and that it is based on facts. Teaching them this way gives them more tools to be able to think scientifically and logically, rather than just religiously.

It is important that children are aware of other people's beliefs and opinions, and it is good for them to be able to make their own informed opinions.

First draft of an inclusive version of the consensus statement based on above contributions (taken from above consensus statement)): In general, teaching creationism in schools is not a bad thing. However, it is important that it is taught in a balanced way and alongside

It is important that children are aware of other people's beliefs and opinions, and it is good for them to be able to make their own informed opinions. It is important to take into account the different backgrounds of children in schools and to cater to this when teaching creationism.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the teaching of creationism in schools is not a bad thing. However, it is important that it is taught in a balanced way and alongside other theories.
