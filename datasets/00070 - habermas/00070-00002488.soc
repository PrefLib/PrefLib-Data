# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, all new cars should not be equipped with speed limiters. The issue of speed limiters is one that is hotly debated. Some people are in favour of them and others are not. It is important to remember that speed is not the only factor that causes accidents. Poor driving and other factors also contribute to accidents. In addition, there are other ways to reduce the number of accidents on the road. These include using speed cameras and having police checkpoints. There is also the issue of cost. It would be expensive to equip all new cars with speed limiters. The cost of this would be passed onto the consumer, which would be unfair. There are also technological issues to consider. What would happen if the speed limiter malfunctioned? This could lead to accidents. In conclusion, there are a number of reasons why all new cars should not be equipped with speed limiters.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of fitting speed limiters to all new cars. However, it was recognised that there were some potential benefits. These included a reduction in the number of accidents, a reduction in fuel consumption and a reduction in the number of deaths on the roads. However, it was felt that these benefits were outweighed by a number of disadvantages. These included the fact that speed limiters could malfunction and cause accidents, they could also be removed and replaced by other drivers who would then be able to drive faster than the speed limit and they would also reduce the ability of drivers to accelerate out of dangerous situations. It was also felt that the majority of accidents were caused by driver error rather than speed and that the best way to reduce the number of accidents on the roads was to improve driver education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of speed limiters but thought that there were a number of issues that needed to be considered. Firstly, the group thought that it was important to consider the type of roads on which the speed limiters would be used. On motorways, the group thought that it would be beneficial to have speed limiters as this would help reduce congestion and the number of accidents. However, on smaller roads, the group thought that speed limiters would be more of a hindrance than a help. The group thought that it would be more beneficial to have speed cameras on smaller roads as this would help reduce the number of accidents. The group also thought that it was important to consider the type of driver that would be using the speed limiters. The group thought that it would be beneficial to have speed limiters on learner drivers as this would help them to get used to driving at a slower speed. The group also thought that it would be beneficial to have speed limiters on young drivers as this would help to reduce the number of accidents caused by young drivers. However, the group thought that it would not be beneficial to have speed limiters on experienced drivers as this would hinder their ability to drive safely.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of fitting speed limiters to all new cars. This is because of the potential safety benefits and also the potential environmental benefits. However, the group was also aware of the potential issues that could arise from fitting speed limiters. For example, if the speed limiter malfunctioned and the car was not able to accelerate out of trouble then this could cause an accident. The group was also aware that fitting speed limiters would not necessarily reduce the number of accidents on the roads. This is because most accidents are caused by driver error rather than speed alone.
