# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, we were in favour of immigration. However, we all agreed that there should be some restrictions and the basis of this should be economic prosperity and stability. People should be allowed to immigrate if they can prove they want to and are capable of working and paying taxes. People should not be allowed to immigrate if they are planning on taking benefits of the country they are not citizens at. We believe that Governments should regularly review job professions struggling to hire (fruit picking, hospitality, healthcare etc. ) and provide list of desired professions every few months. People who don't have experience but want to gain it should be allowed a 3 month period in a country to prove their willingness to work and learn.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of immigration. However, we all agreed that there should be some restrictions. We all agreed that people should be allowed to immigrate if they can prove they want to and are capable of working and paying taxes. People should not be allowed to immigrate if they are planning on taking benefits of the country they are not citizens at. We also believe that Governments should regularly review job professions struggling to hire (fruit picking, hospitality, healthcare etc. ) and provide list of desired professions every few months. Temporary work visas could still be offered.

To illustrate the balanced way of thinking behind the consensus statement, I have displayed the individual opinions from the team members who took the lead in the group discussion. As we can see from the change between the critiques and the final consensus, they managed to reconcile their differences.
