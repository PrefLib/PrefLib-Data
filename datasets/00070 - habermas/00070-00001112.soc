# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There are many factors that contribute to alcohol related harm including; the amount of alcohol drunk, the frequency with which it is drunk, whether it is drunk alone or with other people, and whether the person is under the influence of other substances, particularly drugs. Alcohol can contribute to sexual assaults, fights, road traffic accidents, and assaults. It can cause long term health problems including; liver disease, brain damage, increased risk of cancer and diabetes. It is important that young people are educated about the potential harms of alcohol but equally it is important that they are not allowed access to it. The reason for this is that underage people may not fully realise the destructive potential of alcohol or overly care about that at such a young age. Maturity is hugely important when approaching the consumption of alcohol. Conclusion This is an example of a process of consensus building. It is not an example of a true consensus process because there is no real decision to be made and no action to be taken as a result of the process. However, it shows how different opinions can be debated and ultimately combined into a single view that is acceptable to all. It is important to note that this process did not require any participants to change their own personal view on the subject
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Alcohol is a drug and is addictive. It can cause a great deal of damage to both the person who is addicted and their families. Alcohol use can have a profound impact on sexual behaviour, judgement, safety and violence. It can also lead to serious long term health problems including; liver disease, brain damage, increased risk of cancer and diabetes. As alcohol is so destructive it is vital that young people are educated about its potential harms and also that society ensures that young people do not have access to it, particularly when accompanied with other harms and risk factors such as drug taking and sex.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The legal age for drinking alcohol should not be reduced. Alcohol is a drug and is addictive. Alcohol can cause a great deal of damage to both the person who is addicted and their families. It is not just drinking to excess that causes harm but the use of alcohol in moderation can be harmful as well. There are many factors that contribute to alcohol related harm including; the amount of alcohol drunk, the frequency with which it is drunk, whether it is drunk alone or with other people, and whether the person is under the influence of other substances, particularly drugs. Alcohol can contribute to sexual assaults, fights, road traffic accidents, and assaults. It can cause long term health problems including; liver disease, brain damage, increased risk of cancer and diabetes. It is important that young people are educated about the potential harms of alcohol but equally it is important that they are not allowed access to it. Reducing the age at which people can drink would only increase the risk of alcohol related harm.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: While moderate consumption of alcohol by healthy adults can be safe and some research has even shown that it can be beneficial to cardiovascular and neurological health, alcohol is a drug and is addictive. It can cause a great deal of damage to both the person who is addicted and their families. It is not just drinking to excess that causes harm but the use of alcohol in moderation can be harmful as well. There are many factors that contribute to alcohol related harm including; the amount of alcohol drunk, the frequency with which it is drunk, whether it is drunk alone or with other people, and whether the person is under the influence of other substances, particularly drugs. Alcohol can contribute to sexual assaults, fights, road traffic accidents, and assaults. It can cause long term health problems including; liver disease, brain damage, increased risk of cancer and diabetes. It is important that young people are educated about the potential harms of alcohol but equally it is important that they are not allowed access to it. Reducing the age at which people can drink would only increase the risk of alcohol related harm.
