# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that electric cars should be encouraged through a subsidy for purchasers, with the conditions that new charging infrastructure is installed and the electricity used to charge these cars is coming from renewable energy sources. In this case study, not everyone agreed with the final statement produced. What is important is that the final group opinion was the result of compromise, discussion and debate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The government should be encouraging the use of electric cars by offering tax breaks to their owners. This is because these cars are very expensive and would therefore be prohibitive to those who could not afford to buy one. By offering tax breaks to those who buy electric cars, more people will be able to afford them. This will be beneficial to the environment as more people will be driving electric cars, which do not produce harmful emissions like petrol and diesel cars. The government should also be taking steps to ensure that the electricity used to charge these cars is coming from renewable energy sources. This would make the move to electric cars more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Whilst the infrastructure is being put in place to ensure that there is enough renewable energy capacity to deal with the increased demand this will create, we should continue to incentivise those who can afford it to purchase electric cars, so that we can make a big impact on air pollution in the short term.

The government should also be taking steps to ensure that the electricity used to charge these cars is coming from renewable energy sources. This would make the move to electric cars more sustainable and environmentally friendly. In order to ensure that the charging points for electric cars are readily available and accessible to all, the government should be investing in the infrastructure to install these charging points.
