# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In principle, the group was in favour of a Universal Basic Income system, however, the devil is in the detail and there are many things that need to be considered before such a system could be implemented. The group felt that there are many people in the UK who are currently living in poverty and are reliant on the current benefits system. This system is not fit for purpose and in many cases does not allow people to survive in the context of much higher costs of living at the moment. The group felt that the current benefits system is bureaucratic and inefficient and a system like this would be a vast improvement on the current system. The group also felt that the current system does not encourage people to work and in some cases may actually discourage people from working. A system like this would allow people to work and earn money without the fear of losing their benefits. The group felt that the current system is not equitable and does not treat people with dignity.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe the UK should adopt a Universal Basic Income system to ensure everyone has the minimum income to live not to survive.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “We have debated the introduction of a Universal Basic Income system in the UK. We are in favour of a system of this nature being introduced, albeit with some caveats. Firstly, the costs of such a system would be extremely high and would require considerable tax rises to be introduced, although the potential reduction in benefit bureaucracy may go some way to offsetting this cost. Furthermore, a Universal Basic Income system would need to be implemented carefully to ensure that work incentives are not eroded by providing a very generous basic income to all individuals. However, we are firmly of the view that such a system would provide more dignity to those in receipt of benefits, and may also save money in the long term by reducing bureaucracy and simplifying the benefits system.”
