# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, a universal basic income would increase employment. A universal basic income would mean that people would be able to take up jobs that they enjoy and are skilled at, rather than jobs that they need to do to survive. It would also mean that people who have been unable to work because of caring responsibilities or other commitments would be able to work. This would mean that the economy would benefit from the skills and talents of a wider range of people. A universal basic income would also mean that people would be able to take time out of work to retrain and learn new skills, which would also be good for the economy. However, it is likely that some people would choose not to work if they were receiving a universal basic income, which would mean that there would be less people working and paying taxes. This could mean that taxes would have to be raised to pay for the universal basic income, which could discourage some people from working. It is also possible that a universal basic income would mean that some people would be worse off, as they would be paying more tax but would not be receiving a universal basic income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A universal basic income would increase employment by making it easier for people to work and by encouraging people to work in jobs that they enjoy and are skilled at, rather than jobs that they need to do to survive. A universal basic income would also mean that people who have been unable to work because of caring responsibilities or other commitments would be able to work. This would mean that the economy would benefit from the skills and talents of a wider range of people. A universal basic income would also mean that people would be able to take time out of work to retrain and learn new skills, which would also be good for the economy. However, it is likely that some people would choose not to work if they were receiving a universal basic income, which would mean that there would be less people working and paying taxes. This could mean that taxes would have to be raised to pay for the universal basic income, which could discourage some people from working. It is also possible that a universal basic income would mean that some people would be worse off, as they would be paying more tax but would not be receiving a universal basic income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the introduction of a universal basic income is likely to increase employment as it would free people up to take jobs that they want to do and allow them to work in jobs that are not well paid.  It would also allow people to work part-time and still be able to support their families.  It would also allow people to take time out to retrain and improve their skills.  The introduction of a universal basic income would also mean that people would be in a better position to look after their physical and mental health and this would mean that they would be more able to work.  The introduction of a universal basic income would also mean that people would be able to afford to travel to work and this would mean that they would be more likely to take jobs that are further away from where they live.  This would mean that they would be able to live in areas that are cheaper and have more affordable housing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - A universal basic income would increase employment in some areas. There would be a large number of people who would no longer feel the need to work if they are receiving an income without any strings attached. However, it would also free up others who have not been able to take the type of work that they are capable of or would choose to have as they were unable to live on the income it gave them.  A universal basic income would also allow people to focus more on their hobbies and family, which would ultimately improve their well-being, putting them in a better position to be able to work.
