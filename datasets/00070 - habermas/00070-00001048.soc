# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of parents being required to attend training on how to bring up children. The participants felt that this would help to reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect, and would also improve the child's well-being. It was also felt that the training would help parents to improve their parenting skills, and this would help to enhance the parent-child relationship.
