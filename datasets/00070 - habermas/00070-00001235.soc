# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although increasing taxes on property owners would increase government revenue, it would also have the potential to reduce housing demand and property ownership. There are better ways to raise funds.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should not increase taxes on property owners. We feel that it is unfair to increase taxes on people who have already purchased their property. It is also unfair to increase taxes on people who are just about to purchase their property. It will be very difficult for them to pay the increased taxes. It is also unfair to increase taxes on people who have worked hard all their lives to purchase their property. We feel that there are much better ways to raise funds.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Property owners should not have their taxes increased. This is because it is unfair to retrospectively increase taxes, and also because it will lead to an increase in homelessness. The economy will also be negatively affected by reduced spending.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It was agreed that the overall opinion of the group was that we shouldn't increase taxes on property owners, as this would increase financial pressure on a huge number of people in the country, especially people who have a mortgage. Although the economy is not in a great state, the group felt that the potential financial problems of increasing property taxes far outweigh any potential economic benefits that might come about. It was also felt that property taxes are a tax that disproportionately affect the less wealthy, as the rich are more likely to have other forms of investment, so it would be unfair to increase taxes for those who have already invested in property. It was also noted that increasing property taxes would lead to a reduction in house prices, which could actually make it more difficult for people to get on the property ladder, because people will struggle to raise enough money for a deposit.
