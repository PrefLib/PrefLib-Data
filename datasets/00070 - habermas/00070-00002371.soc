# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should spend more money on health care. The NHS is one of our National Treasures and should be protected so that we can all benefit from it. More money is needed to retain and improve this service. The NHS is in crisis - I belive much more money should be spent on health care in particular. Waiting times for A&E are very, very long. Ambulances can take hours to respond to cases of life-threatening injuries, sometimes longer. It is impossible to find an NHS dentist in most parts of the country. Children have had to wait months and months and be in severe pain before they can even get an appointment. Patients have been reduced to pulling out their own teeth. This is madness, especially in a first world country in the 21st century. I think that both are important, but there are many ways that education can be provided and i think that the priority should be on healthcare so that we can help keep people healthy, research cures and treatments for diseases and illnessses and make sure that people are cared for and looked after. I also think that the health care in the UK is severely underfunded and myself and most people that I know have suffered failings from the NHS due to low funding
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the government should spend more money on health care. The NHS is one of our National Treasures and should be protected so that we can all benefit from it. More money is needed to retain and improve this service. However, it is important to remember that education is also important. Education is important to increase the skill level of the workforce and the quality of life of individuals. It is also important to remember that both health care and education can increase economic growth, promote income equality, and reduce poverty.

This is madness, especially in a first world country in the 21st century. Education should also be a priority but right now healthcare takes precedent. To be blunt, if people are dying, they can't very well receive an education.

People are not getting enough support regarding their health and their are long waiting lists.
