# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Medical records are confidential and should remain so. The law needs to be more strictly enforced and more robust legislation is needed to prevent abuse of this private information.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, yes we should tighten up the laws about who can have access to NHS records. We are living in a digital age where electronic systems and records are becoming increasingly common. The privacy of an individuals information is extremely important and laws need to be enforced to prevent unauthorised access to records.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the laws governing who can access NHS records are sufficient.  There should be a very clear and strict process for anyone who wants to access records and this process should be transparent and well documented.  The process should be overseen by a governing body to ensure that it is being followed.  There should be a very clear distinction between records that are used for research and those that are used for marketing purposes.  Records used for research should be de-identified and should not contain any personally identifiable information.  Records used for marketing purposes should not be allowed to contain any personally identifiable information.  The laws should be tightened up to ensure that these distinctions are clear and that the process is followed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the laws governing access to NHS records are adequate.  De-identified NHS records should be able to be used for research projects and to improve the services, but should not be used by third parties for purposes such as marketing.
