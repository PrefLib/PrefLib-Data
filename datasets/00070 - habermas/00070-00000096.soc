# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I believe that we should consider introducing a universal basic income for all citizens. The current system of benefits are highly inefficient and involve a great deal of administration. A UBI would also increase equality in society, especially as we move further into the age of automation.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the idea of UBI is an interesting one. The way we see it, is that a UBI would allow people to afford basic needs such as food and shelter. However, we also believe that there should be some kind of cap on the amount of income that you can earn while still being eligible for UBI. We also think that it would have to be regulated by country, so that the rich are not getting any UBI.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should consider the introduction of a universal basic income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that a system of universal basic income should be adopted. We think that this will reduce poverty, and also give people more free time and greater opportunities to explore new things and become more creative. We are also concerned that a minimum income will result in people spending their money on more harmful things, like alcohol and drugs, so we also want to impose restrictions on people using the scheme, such as drug tests.
