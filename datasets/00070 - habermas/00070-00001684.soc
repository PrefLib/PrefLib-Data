# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that, on average, the Briton’s attitude towards the Chinese government is not hostile. We feel that there is no reason to believe that Britons dislike the Chinese government. This view is supported by the fact that there are many joint projects between the UK and China.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “The average Briton’s attitude to the Chinese government is not hostile. The average Briton is unaware of the Chinese government’s policies and the Chinese government’s relationship with the British government. The average Briton is unaware of the Chinese government’s relationship with the British government and therefore does not have a hostile attitude to the Chinese government. The average Briton is unaware of the Chinese government’s policies and therefore does not have a hostile attitude to the Chinese government. The average Briton is unaware of the Chinese government’s relationship with the British government and therefore does not have a hostile attitude to the Chinese government. The average Briton is unaware of the Chinese government’s policies and therefore does not have a hostile attitude to the Chinese government. The average Briton is unaware of the Chinese government’s relationship with the British government and therefore does not have a hostile attitude to the Chinese government. The average Briton is unaware of the Chinese government’s policies and therefore does not have a hostile attitude to the Chinese government. The average Briton is unaware of the Chinese government’s relationship with the British government and therefore does not have a hostile attitude to the Chinese government. The average Briton is unaware of the Chinese government’
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “The average Briton has a slightly hostile attitude to the Chinese government. This is mainly due to the fact that China is often mentioned as a threat by politicians in the UK government. Although the average Briton sees the Chinese government as hostile, I imagine that many would struggle to give specific reasons why, other than that it is a communist country. This is in contrast to the USA, who are also communist but are not seen as a threat to the UK. The average Briton is also often exposed to negative portrayals of the Chinese government in the media, which will contribute to their attitude.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The average Briton’s attitude to the Chinese government is more likely to be slightly hostile rather than very hostile or very friendly. The Briton is aware of the growing importance of China to the world economy, but also fears China’s rise. This fear has been partly generated by the media and the negative way China is often portrayed. There is also a level of scepticism towards the Chinese government due to the opacity of the Chinese political system.
