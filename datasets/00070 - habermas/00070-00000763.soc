# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We have come to the conclusion that it is not okay to build a nuclear power plant next to a village. The main reason for this is because if there was to be a leak of radiation, the people who live in the village would be affected by it and it could have a very negative impact on their health. Another reason for this is because the nuclear power plant could cause a lot of pollution to the air and it could cause the people who live in the village to get ill. We also think that if the nuclear power plant was to be built, it could attract a lot of people to the village which could cause a lot of traffic and this could be a problem for the people who live in the village. We also think that it would be unfair on the people who live in the village because they would have to look at the nuclear power plant every day and this could cause them to become unhappy.
