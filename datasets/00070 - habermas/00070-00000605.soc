# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Companies should be obliged to report on the ethnicity pay gap.  This is so that the issues can be highlighted and so that companies can be held to account for any discrimination.  If companies are not obliged to report on the ethnicity pay gap, then it will not be possible to tackle the issue.  However, smaller companies (those with less than 10 employees) should not be obliged to report on the ethnicity pay gap.
