# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050, but we should not stop there. We should set a goal to be carbon negative by 2050 and continue to make progress in this direction. We should not wait for technology to solve the problem, but we should start now to make the changes necessary to reach this goal. We should stop building new buildings that are not carbon neutral. We should stop using fossil fuels for transport and heating. We should invest in green energy and stop using nuclear power. We should plant more trees and stop deforestation. We should stop using single use plastics. We should stop eating meat. We should stop flying for holidays. We should stop using the car for short journeys. We should stop using the car for commuting. We should stop using the car for everything.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050, as this is a key step in helping to combat climate change. The UK is a leader in climate change and should be setting an example to the rest of the world in this area. We are already making progress in this area, with more renewable energy being produced and used in the UK, and more electric vehicles being sold. We should be aiming to achieve this goal sooner, as climate change is a major threat to the planet and to society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should set a zero neutral carbon goal, yes. The goal should be to be carbon neutral by 2030, not 2050. This is because the world is changing very fast and we need to keep up. We need to make a big effort now to make the change to renewable energy and make it affordable for everyone. We need to stop using so much plastic and making so much waste. We need to promote active travel and working from home much more too. We need to make sure that we have enough food to eat and that we don't waste so much food.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050 at the latest. The world has changed a lot in the last 100 years and we need to awaken our eyes to the effect that man has on this planet. Industry and technology has run away with itself and pollution of the earth will eventually kill it. We need to protect the planet and take on board climate change and all its problems - famine, mass migration. The UK should set a zero neutral carbon goal, yes. But 2050 is way too late. We should aim to have this done in the next 5 years at the very longest. Most of our electricity can already be generated from wind and solar power, we just need to step up. No more new buildings that are not carbon neutral. It is crazy that we are building new buildings that have no solar panels and no triple glazing. We need to promote active travel and working from home much more too. I think that a goal of being carbon neutral is great for the UK is great, however I don't believe that 2050 is a realistic target.  Achievement of the goal depends n a lot of things such as cost, people's commitment, research and technology. I would go further than this
