# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I'm honestly not educated enough on this topic to have a strong opinion one way or another. I will say that as a rule anyone who profits from rising house prices is likely a landlord or someone who works in real estate, and those people seem like they are largely scum to me. So a tentative 'yes'.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I believe we should impose a tax on the very wealthy who own multiple properties and use property ownership as their main source of income, I don't believe we should impose a tax on regular home owners who's houses happen to have gone up in value
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, I do not think that we should impose a capital gains tax on owners who profit from rising house prices in the same way that we shouldn't give grants to property owners when house prices fall.  
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I don't think we should impose on another tax on property owners that profit from rising house prices, as a sale of a property is already taxed quite heavily and house prices have been rising constantly throughout history (bar a few notable years i.e 2008) so this could further complicate this imposition because it then causes another debate of how far do you backtrack and implement this law. Houses are seen by most as the safest investment, adding more taxes into this could lower the profitability of this and lead to more people opting to rent rather than owning a home.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I don't know what capital gains tax is honestly, but if it's what I assume, a tax on the profit made from buying a home, then I'm not so sure. It would depend on who it would apply to, length of time involved etc. For someone who buys property regularly as a business, I think that wouldn't go amiss depending on the amount of profit. But if that was to apply to everyone who purchased a house, it wouldn't be reasonable as it would apply to nearly everyone depending on the market at the time of sale. It would be a punishment for someone who had sold their house after living their for 10years who had to move for life reasons, especially those on lower income brackets. If it was on "professional" landlords or people who make massive profits on very expensive properties, that would be different.
