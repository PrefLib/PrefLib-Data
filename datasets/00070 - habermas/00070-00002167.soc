# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Smoking cigarettes is a major health risk and there are a lot of resources used by the NHS to help and support people who make the decision to smoke. Taxation is a good way to discourage people from smoking as it increases the price of cigarettes and this should lead to a reduction in the number of people buying cigarettes. This can lead to a reduction in the amount of resources used by the NHS on smoking related illnesses. However, this may not discourage those who are really addicted or can afford it anyway if they have more disposable income.The group also agreed that there are much more productive ways to discourage people from smoking, and i think this includes the media and educating people while young. While there are benefits to taxing, this would just penalise the poorest from society, rather than creating a suitable alternative to smoking. Having cheap and effective ways to ease from smoking would benefit them better - especially if this is free on the NHS.
