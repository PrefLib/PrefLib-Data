# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Universities should not give admission priority to disadvantaged groups. People who are disadvantaged should be given scholarships to help them achieve their potential, but they should not be given priority admission. The reason for this is that if people are disadvantaged, it is likely that they will have had a tougher life than most and have had to work harder to achieve their grades. Therefore, they deserve to be rewarded for their hard work and effort, but should not be given an advantage over people who have had a more fortunate life. The group also felt that if disadvantaged people are given priority admission, then it is not fair on other people who have worked just as hard, if not harder, to achieve the grades they need to get into university.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, universities should not give admission priority to disadvantaged groups. We believe that disadvantaged groups should be given the same opportunities as everyone else, but that they should not be fast tracked through the system. We also believe that if a disadvantaged group is capable of gaining entry into university through the normal channels, then they should be allowed to do so. However, if a disadvantaged group is not able to gain entry through the normal channels, then we believe that universities should be able to offer them the chance to gain entry through a different channel.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, universities should not give admission priority to disadvantaged groups. The primary reason for this is that universities are institutions of higher learning, and it is the role of universities to ensure that the people who attend them are able to complete the course of study. Therefore, it is the role of universities to ensure that the people who attend them are able to complete the course of study. Therefore, it is the role of universities to ensure that the people who attend them are academically capable of completing the course of study. The second reason is that it is unfair to the other students who are academically capable of completing the course of study, but who are not members of disadvantaged groups. The third reason is that disadvantaged groups are not a homogenous group, and there are many different kinds of disadvantages. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which disadvantaged groups should be given priority and which should not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of giving priority admission to disadvantaged groups. The group felt that this would be unfair to other students who were not disadvantaged, and that it would not be in the best interests of the disadvantaged students themselves. The group felt that if a student was disadvantaged, but still academically capable of attending university, then they should be given the opportunity to attend university, but that this should not be at the expense of other students. The group felt that it would be more beneficial for the disadvantaged student to attend a university that they were academically capable of attending, rather than being fast tracked into a university that they may not be able to keep up with.
