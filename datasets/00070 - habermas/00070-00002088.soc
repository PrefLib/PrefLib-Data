# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to a ban on the sale of soft drinks that are high in sugar. It was felt that this would be an infringement on personal freedom, and that people should be allowed to make their own choices. However, it was also felt that people should be made aware of the risks associated with consuming these drinks, and that the government should be doing more to make this information available to the public. It was also felt that the government should be doing more to promote the sale of healthier alternatives, such as water, and that they should be making it easier for people to purchase these alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: People should have a right to make decisions for themselves. However, if they are to make these decisions, they need to be aware of the risks associated with these decisions. Banning sugar-heavy soft drinks would just increase the price of these drinks and lead to their sale on the black market. We should therefore inform people of the risks associated with these drinks and make sure that they are aware that alternatives are available. This would give people the freedom to make their own decisions whilst making sure that they are fully informed. The questions was from this article in the Guardian.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should have a right to choose what they consume. However, if they are to consume high sugar content soft drinks, they should be made aware of the health risks. Banning such drinks would simply lead to individuals seeking to obtain them from other means. It would be more effective to increase incentives for the purchase of healthy alternatives.
