# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should help the poor in other countries as it is our duty as humans to help others. However it is more important to look after our own people who are struggling financially and who are in need of the support. This is why we are all paying taxes to the government. So before any money is sent abroad it should be spent within the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the UK has the obligation to help the poor people in other countries. However, as there are a great number of countries, we should help them in order of priority. We should only help the poor people in other countries with money raised from taxes if there are enough funds to help all people living in poverty in the UK as well.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is only right that we should help poor people in other countries. We have a moral duty as humans to do this, and in the long run it is beneficial for everyone that we do so. The UK has a history of being a generous nation and this is an important thing to maintain. However, the money spent should be considered carefully as there is a limit to the amount of help we can give. We must prioritise looking after our own people who are struggling financially, so the amount of money we send abroad should not exceed what is needed in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There is a degree of hypocrisy in the concept of giving aid to other countries while having austerity measures in the UK. However we should not be ignorant to the fact that we are more fortunate than many people in other countries. The British government does have an obligation to help the less fortunate and if there is surplus from the taxes raised, this money should be used to help people abroad. It is however more important that this money is spent on people at home, who are struggling financially, and that we look after our own people. We are not however obligated to help everyone in every country and there are many poor people in the UK who should take priority.
