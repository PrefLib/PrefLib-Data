# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although teachers have a duty to provide students with a well rounded education, they also have a right to their own beliefs, which should be respected. If a parent feels that their child is being pressured into a certain belief, they should address this with the school rather than asking to know the religion of the teacher.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that parents should not have the right to know the religion of their child's teacher. Religion is a private matter that has no place in the workplace and the classroom, as all religions are equal and we believe that it is wrong to treat them any differently. Teachers are in the position of authority and have a responsibility to provide a balanced education for all children and must keep their own religious beliefs private. In the case where parents have a concern that a teacher's personal religious beliefs are being passed on to their children, then they have the right to address these concerns with the school and the teacher, but it is not their right to have this information without reason.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, parents should not have the right to know the religion of their child’s teachers. The religion of a teacher should not affect the way they do their job.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of parents having the right to know the religion of their child’s teachers. However, they felt that this information should only be provided if there is evidence that the teacher is pushing their religion onto the children. The group felt that this would be a breach of the teacher’s professional code of conduct. The group also felt that the religion of the teacher should not be a barrier to employment, and that teachers should be hired on the basis of their qualifications and experience.
