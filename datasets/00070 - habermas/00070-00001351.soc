# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although fracking will provide jobs for locals, and stopping it would be making people redundant, it poses a great environmental risk. A planet as a whole and not just Scotland nationally should be looking to change to renewables such as wind and wave farms, which do much less damage to the flora and fauna than fracking.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a ban on fracking in Scotland. The reasons for this are that there are other more sustainable and environmentally friendly options for energy that should be pursued instead.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We are all fairly undecided on the question of whether fracking should be allowed in Scotland. We feel that the question is not simple and is a balancing act between how important fracking is to the economy, how important it is for energy supply, how dangerous it is to the environment, how many jobs it can provide and how it will affect the future of the country. We feel that there is not enough evidence to support or argue for one side or the other of this question, and the only way we could possibly come to a conclusion on this is if more research is done on fracking to understand how dangerous it really is. We feel that the decision should be based on whether or not fracking is bad for the environment, and if it is, there should be better methods of ensuring Scotland has a constant supply of energy. If it is not bad for the environment, we feel that it should be allowed in Scotland as a safer alternative to other methods of energy supply, and as a method of creating jobs for the country. We feel that this should be investigated further and in order to ensure that it is safe, we believe the government should look at funding more research into this area.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Fracking should not be allowed in Scotland, or anywhere else. We should be shifting all the resources that might go into this area to renewable and sustainable energy sources that will safely provide what we need for decades and centuries to come, not short term profit-driven maximising of the final bits of fossil fuel we can extract. There may be economic and short term benefits but the social, ethical and long term case is untenable given all that is known about the harms of fossil fuel use. We should be adding as little as possible to the problems associated with old energy sources and beginning to solve those problems instead of leaving this for the future to make up for.
