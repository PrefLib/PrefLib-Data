# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of legalising cannabis for recreational use. They felt that it would help to reduce the black market, and that it would be better to have it regulated by the government. They also felt that it would help people who want to use it for medical reasons, and that it would be better to have it sold by trusted companies. They felt that it would be important to have it sold with the dosage clearly labelled, and that it would be important to have it sold with clear instructions on how to use it. They also felt that it would be important to have it sold with a health warning, to make people aware of the potential dangers of using it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of legalising cannabis for recreational use. However, there were a number of caveats. Firstly, it should only be sold to people over the age of 18. Secondly, it should only be sold in licensed premises, and not in places such as petrol stations and corner shops. Thirdly, it should be sold in a way that is not attractive to children, and should not be sold in a way that makes it appear attractive. Finally, there should be a ban on the advertising of cannabis, to ensure that it is not seen as glamorous or cool.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Although cannabis is a harmful drug, we believe that it should be legalised. This will reduce crime, and the harm caused by unregulated and illegal supply. It will allow those with chronic pain and other medical conditions to benefit from its use. It will also generate revenue through taxation. There would need to be restrictions on its use such as age limits, restrictions on where it can be used, restrictions on the strength of the product, and monitoring of use.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Consensus view: In the opinion of the group, legalisation of recreational cannabis is likely to be a good thing for the country and its people, providing it is regulated in a similar way to tobacco and alcohol.  It would make the product available to people who want to use it for recreational reasons.  It will make it available to people who wish to use it for medical purposes.  It will remove the criminal element in cannabis supply.  It will make the country money by taxing cannabis sales.  It will make the police more efficient in their work, as they will no longer be tasked with dealing with cannabis possession.  However, we also feel that legalisation of recreational cannabis should only happen when the public are fully aware of the risks involved, and that the drug should be heavily regulated in a similar way to tobacco and alcohol.
