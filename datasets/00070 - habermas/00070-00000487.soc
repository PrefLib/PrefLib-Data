# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, human-animal hybrids should not be allowed to be created through genetic engineering. We are playing God, and this will inevitably cause some sort of harm. The risk is not worth the reward.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, human-animal hybrids should not be allowed to be created through genetic engineering. Humans cannot predict the consequences of human-animal hybrids and will likely disrupt the natural ecosystem, leading to potential harm to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, human-animal hybrids should not be allowed to be created through genetic engineering. Humans are playing God.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, human-animal hybrids should not be allowed to be created through genetic engineering. Creating hybrids would be unnatural and cause unpredictable disruptions to ecosystems.
