# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK government should continue to levy the sale of plastic bags. The revenue from this should be used to pay for plastic bag recycling facilities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The group felt that the government should phase out the sale of plastic bags. This would allow for people to use the plastic bags they already own and allow for the new introduction of paper bags.  The consensus view was that these would be more environmentally friendly and people could use them several times.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The government should ban the sale of plastic bags.  They should be replaced with a reusable bag that is easily cleaned and is of a higher quality.  These reusable bags should be more expensive, however, to discourage people from getting them, to force them to get a reusable bag and hopefully force them to keep the bag for longer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The Government should ban the sale of plastic bags.”
