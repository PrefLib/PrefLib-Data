# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No. We should not continue to have a Royal Family.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we should not continue to have a Royal Family. The idea of a royal family is outdated and not in keeping with the values of a modern society. The idea of a royal family brings no benefit to the country and is a waste of taxpayer money that could be better spent on the NHS, education and other public services. The royal family is also exempt from prosecution, which is not in keeping with a fair and just society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We think that the UK should abolish the royal family. While they may be an important part of British history and tradition, they are not an important part of the current government, they are not elected and so do not represent the people. They also don't contribute anything to society, apart from the one or two members who try to use their position for charity work, and this can be replaced by people who are more directly involved in the cause and understand it better. In addition, the huge amount of money that is spent on maintaining the royal family could be better spent elsewhere, such as the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, we should not continue to have a royal family. We do not think that they bring enough value to the country to justify the millions in taxpayer money that they are given every year to occupy a position that isn't decided by merit, but birth. We also do not think that they bring in money for the UK, but the historic locations like Buckingham Palace. The Crown Estate's profits don't count either, since they belong to the government.
