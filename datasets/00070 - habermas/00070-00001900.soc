# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the current system of voting is not perfect, and could be improved upon. There are a number of different systems of voting which could be used, and each has its pros and cons. The current system is not perfect, and it is not clear which system would be better. It is also not clear whether the system would be better for the country as a whole, or just for certain groups. It would be beneficial for the country to move to a different system of voting, but this would need to be carefully considered.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of a proportional representation system, whereby every vote has equal weight. However, the group was not in favour of the current system of proportional representation used in Germany, whereby voters have a list of candidates to vote for, and the votes are counted according to the percentage of votes each candidate received. Instead, the group favoured the system used in Scotland, whereby voters vote for the party they want to represent them, and the seats are allocated to parties according to the percentage of votes each party received.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that we should move to a different system of democratic voting. This is because we believe that the current system, which is known as First Past the Post, does not accurately represent the view of the population. For example, in 2015 the Conservative party gained 36% of the vote, but ended up with 51% of the seats in the House of Commons. As a result, in 2017 only 2% of the population voted Conservative, but they gained a majority in Parliament. This is because of the system in which we vote, which was introduced in the nineteenth century and we believe is outdated. We feel that we should have a proportional representation system, whereby each vote is given equal weight, and so the proportion of seats in Parliament reflects the proportion of the population who vote for a particular party. We believe this is more democratic, fair and will allow smaller parties to have a voice.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group feels that there should be a change in the system of voting. This would enable everyone's vote to count equally and would mean that the power was not held by a small minority of the population. Discussion
