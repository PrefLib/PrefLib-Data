# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The move to a four-day working week is something we should be looking at. There are many positives that would come from the change. One is improved work-life balance, another is the positives on mental health. The move is not one that is very high on the agenda but should be looked at in the near future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The move to a four-day working week is something we should be looking at. There are many positives that would come from the change. One is improved work-life balance, another is the positives on mental health. The move is not one that is very high on the agenda but should be looked at in the near future. The benefits far outweigh the costs and I think that the four day working week is a positive thing for Ireland to implement.
