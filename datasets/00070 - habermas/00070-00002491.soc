# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Human-induced climate change is a serious problem that needs to be addressed urgently. We have already seen the effects of these changes and if we do not start making changes, we will face even worse changes globally and we will not be able to turn back the clock. Scientists have a clock that shows this and it has moved over the last few years. We must take responsibility to protect the environment and not be reckless with our actions such as polluting water, emissions and neglect of nature. If we do not protect our planet then we all will suffer consequences of climate change and more difficult living conditions. Governments must do more to reward good intentions and actions and move away from protecting big businesses and their reckless actions. I think too many political parties and members have a conflict of interest in the environmental debate. Humans over use of fossil fuels and not being environmentally friendly in general has had a major impact on the Earth and its resources. We are the main reason that climate change is happening. From a mix of the farming processes we use, the ways in which we produce energy and the rates at which we are cutting down trees all over the world. We no longer live in a sustainable way and this has had a huge negative impact on the climate
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes, human-induced climate change is a serious problem. We are the main reason that climate change is happening. From a mix of the farming processes we use, the ways in which we produce energy and the rates at which we are cutting down trees all over the world. We no longer live in a sustainable way and this has a huge negative impact on the climate in the world. Ice is melting and water levels are rising, there will soon be many places under water. If we do not start making changes, we will face even worse changes globally and we will not be able to turn back the clock. Governments must do more to reward good intentions and actions and move away from protecting big businesses and their reckless actions. We must take responsibility to protect the environment and not be reckless with our actions such as polluting water, emissions and neglect of nature.

Governments must do more to reward good intentions and actions and move away from protecting big businesses and their reckless actions. We are moving closer to the point of no return and scientist have explained that if we do not change, we will make the world inhabbitable, not just for ourselves but for all life. This would ultimately lead to the extinsion of all life on this planet. We are already seeing the effects of these changes, just look at the global climate, it has changed drastically over the last 20
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes, human-induced climate change is a serious problem. The world is facing serious environmental challenges. These challenges are the result of human activities that cause climate change. The main cause of climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. This is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The use of fossil fuels is a key part of the global economy. However, it is also a key part of the problem of climate change. The burning of fossil fuels is the main cause of the increase in the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This is the main cause of the greenhouse effect and global warming. The consequences of climate change are serious. Climate change is already having a major impact on the environment. It is also having a major impact on the economy and on people's lives. If we do not act now to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, the consequences will be even worse. The world needs to make major changes to the way we live and the way we do business.
