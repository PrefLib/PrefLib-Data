# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes absolutely. Although not yet perfected (battery longevity and the source of electricity etc), electric vehicles are a big step towards reducing carbon emissions and avoiding climate change. This can only become viable for a lot of people by increasing the number of charging points.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes if we are to move away from reliance on fossil fuels we need to make the move over to electric vehicles ASAP and if you are going to convince people to actually make this switch you need to make charging cars as convenient as possible, increasing the number of charge points would help this
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - I believe we should help sales of electric vehicles by increasing the avaliabilty of charging points, as currently that is one of the biggest constricting factors. Currently most of the UK is under devoloped in EV infrastructure, apart from a few notable cities like Oxford. Adding charing points to petrol stations and car parks of businesses wouldn't incur too much of a cost but would help the on-ramp of people switching over to electric cars greatly.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - I don't think increasing the number of charging points would encourage the sale of electric cars as much as a lower price point for electric cars would improve sales. If there is need for more due to rising costs that is a different and more necessary need. I'm not convinced at this stage by electric vehicles being a long running solution to alternative options for transportation so I don't feel strongly about this issue. I think it would be better to look into other options for transportation as electric vehicles are heavier, bulkier and more dangerous due to high acceleration. Even more on the roads now would make me concerned.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Statement 5 - I think that it would be a good idea to make a lot more charging points as at the moment it is very off-putting as there as so few charging points around and this discourages people from buying electric cars.  Electric cars are the future and people should be helped to make the transition to using them by all possible means.
