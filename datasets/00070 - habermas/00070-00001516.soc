# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “No the government should not provide free contraception to everyone, as the money would be better spent on welfare. There is no evidence that limiting the availability of contraception will increase unplanned births.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should provide free contraception to everyone. This would reduce the burden on our welfare system and no longer punish people unable to afford contraception. Limiting the availability of contraception will increase unplanned births. The money spent would be fantastic value and would likely save money in the long term. Women should not be the only ones who have to take the hit on their bodies. By making all contraceptive free, more men will use it.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “We have debated the issue and come to the conclusion that everyone should be provided with free contraception. We acknowledge that the majority of costs related to unplanned pregnancies are borne by the mother, and women are unfairly penalised for not being able to afford contraception. This is unfair. Men also need to take responsibility and we agree that it is unlikely to be successful unless contraception is provided for free to everyone. We also agree that the economic benefits of such a scheme would be substantial, particularly when you consider that those most likely to struggle to pay for contraception are those who can least afford it. It is clear to us that providing free contraception will save the government money in the long term.”
