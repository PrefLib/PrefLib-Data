# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Landlords should be forced to install insulation before renting their property to a new tenant because it's important for the well being of the tenant that they are warm and comfortable. This is the landlords responsibility to ensure this is done. In order to become a landlord the government should place requirements on landlords. I believe that landlords have a responsibility to ensure that their accommodations are well-insulated because their tenants are not permitted to make the changes themselves and they may not be able to afford to do so. With the cost of living crisis and the climate emergency, it is essential that landlords play their part in keeping energy costs down and energy consumption low. Yeah. If the insulation is top notch, tenants won't have to spend much on heating their homes. This will reduce energy usage throughout the country I believe we should force landlords to install insulation before renting their property to new tenants. Most landlords are in this position to make as much money as possible without actually providing or producing anything. Any regulation or law that makes it harder for landlords to make money at the expense of people just trying to find a home is a good thing in my opinion.
