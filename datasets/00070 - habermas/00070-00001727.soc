# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to raising taxes on petrol. They argued that the government already makes huge amounts of money from the tax on petrol and that the tax is already very high. They also argued that if the government raised the tax on petrol, it would not necessarily be used to improve the roads and public transport, but would go into the government's general revenue. However, they did think that the tax on petrol could be used to discourage people from using their cars so much and to encourage them to use public transport instead. They thought that this would be a good thing as it would reduce pollution and congestion on the roads.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - While it is clear the tax on petrol would have an immediate effect on the environment, we also need to consider how it will affect the people. On the one hand, the fuel tax is an effective way to reduce pollution as it reduces the use of petrol, but it is also known to have an effect on low income families, and would also result in an increase in the cost of transportation of goods, thus adding to inflation. If petrol tax is introduced, the government should use the money to reduce the amount of taxes, as well as improving the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should not raise the tax on petrol. Taxes on petrol are not actually for the roads and not raised for public transport.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should raise taxes on petrol. The increase in price will help reduce pollution and the money can be used to help the environment.
