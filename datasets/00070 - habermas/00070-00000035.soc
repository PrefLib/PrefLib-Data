# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Parenting classes should be made available for all parents to attend on a voluntary basis. Parents wishing to receive the child allowance should be required to attend parenting classes as a condition of eligibility.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be some form of parenting class offered to all parents of young children and those on benefits. The people attending the class should not be forced to attend and should be able to attend anonymously and without fear of stigma.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the idea of parenting classes to qualify for child allowance is a good one. However, there may be some exceptions to this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Parenting classes should be available to all families, however, we would like to see a greater incentive for those families that need it most. This could be in the form of larger benefit payments if they can show proof of attendance at the parenting classes.”
