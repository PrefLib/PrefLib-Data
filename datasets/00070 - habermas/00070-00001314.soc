# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that high earners should pay higher taxes as the gap between rich and poor has become too big and too many people in the UK live in poverty. In the modern age there is no excuse for poverty in a developed country and as such we need to raise the taxes of high earners. This should be done in a manner that is fair for all concerned and in a way that does not encourage people to stop working. The extra money collected should be used to help people in poverty and help people to avoid poverty in the future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be an increase in taxes on high earners. The current system is unfair and there is a significant and growing gap between the rich and the poor. High earners should pay a higher percentage of their earnings in tax to ensure that the government has enough money to provide adequate services for everyone. The current system is unfair and needs to be changed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should increase taxes on high earners. The interests of high earners have been protected by the Conservative government long enough. The largest-earning corporations should pay far more tax than they currently do. The gap between the richest and poorest seems to be getting worse and worse. The rich appear to be using clever tax avoidance loopholes to pay less tax which has a knock on effect on the countries ability to fund services paid for by our taxes. There would need to be a way of making sure tax from high earners was collected before it disappears to the Cayman Islands.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe the government should be introducing an increase on tax for high earners. This will reduce the inequality gap, and allow the government to provide services for all citizens. The government should also look into making sure that tax from high earners is being collected, and that there are no loopholes that allow these high earners to avoid paying tax.
