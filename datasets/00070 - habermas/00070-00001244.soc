# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We generally agree that there should be a minimum price for alcohol. The effects of setting one are not necessarily about making people pay more for a luxury; its aims are to make them think more about their drinking habits and be more selective about what they choose to drink. If people know they have to pay more for alcohol, they might pay more attention to the choices they are making. In particular, cheaper alcohol is known to be associated with increased rates of alcoholism and poor health. For this reason, we argue that by putting a minimum price on alcohol, we will reduce the rates of both diseases. The minimum price would have the most impact on those who buy alcohol to get drunk. As long as the price is set low enough not to alienate the more 'casual' drinker, it could be an effective way of targeting the types of drinkers most likely to cause harm to themselves or others. The most important thing here is that we avoid the idea of a minimum price increasing the prestige of drinking and instead create a society where people are aware of the high costs of alcohol both to themselves and the NHS, and they consciously drink for pleasure rather than trying to obliterate their problems for a short while.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There should be a minimum price for alcohol. This would make it more difficult to get very drunk and would also lead to more careful consumption and possibly more enjoyment of alcohol.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of setting a minimum price for alcohol. We argued that as long as the price is set low enough not to put people off drinking entirely, it could be an effective way of regulating consumption. People will still drink, but they will be less likely to get so drunk as they are buying a higher quality product. Also, a higher price could mean that people will think more carefully about their choices, for example, whether to drive home after drinking. The people that it would affect the most are those that drink to get drunk and who buy cheap, low quality alcohol. If you are paying a reasonable amount for alcohol, you are more likely to enjoy it.
