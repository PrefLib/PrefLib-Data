# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Political correctness is hampering free speech. The group was in agreement that freedom of speech is an important principle of a free and democratic society. The group was also in agreement that people should not be able to say whatever they like. The group also agreed that freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequences, and never has. The group also agreed that there is a difference between hate speech and free speech, and that there is a difference between freedom of speech and freedom of consequences.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Political correctness is hampering free speech.  In the past, people were able to say things that were offensive and upsetting to others.  The fact that people are now pushing back against this is not a sign that free speech is being stifled, but rather a sign that people are starting to recognise that words can have consequences, and that we should not tolerate hate speech and other forms of bigotry.  Political correctness is not a bad thing, and the idea that it is is a dangerous one.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Political correctness is not hampering free speech. The concept of political correctness is often misunderstood. It is not about censorship, it is about calling out language that is offensive. It is about calling out language that is disrespectful and hurtful to people. It is about calling out language that is not in keeping with the values of our society. It is about calling out language that is bigoted, hateful, or intolerant. It is not about shutting down conversations. It is not about censorship. It is not about limiting freedom of speech. Political correctness is not hampering free speech. In fact, it is ensuring that free speech is not being used to perpetuate hateful and intolerant ideas. Political correctness is an important part of our society and it is not hampering free speech.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Political correctness is hampering free speech. The group was in agreement that political correctness has gone too far. The group was also in agreement that freedom of speech is important, and that people should be able to say what they want, as long as it is not hate speech or harmful. The group was in agreement that people should not be able to use political correctness as an excuse to shut down conversations.
