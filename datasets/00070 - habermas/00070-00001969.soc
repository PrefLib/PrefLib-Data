# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People should be free to make their own dietary choices, and should not be encouraged to become vegetarian or vegan.  It is much more difficult to ensure you consume a balanced diet if you do not eat meat.  I believe too much is being made of the environmental impact of meat production; in fact there are many things which are far more damaging to the environment than consuming meat.  Vegetarianism and veganism should be encouraged but not forced upon people, it's a healthier and more carbon friendly way of life that has a lot of benefits however the choice should still be left to the individual. Vegetarianism and Veganism have been shown to have a positive impact of global warming as less water waste and greenhouse gases are produced when animals aren't involved in a persons diet. A good idea would be encouraging more vegetarian days into a persons life who doesn't want to be compeltley vegetarian.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, people should be free to make their own dietary choices, and should not be encouraged to become vegetarian or vegan.  However, it is much more difficult to ensure you consume a balanced diet if you do not eat meat.  We believe too much is being made of the environmental impact of meat production; in fact there are many things which are far more damaging to the environment than consuming meat.  We believe that vegetarianism and veganism should be encouraged but not forced upon people, it's a healthier and more carbon friendly way of life that has a lot of benefits however the choice should still be left to the individual. Vegetarianism and Veganism have been shown to have a positive impact of global warming as less water waste and greenhouse gases are produced when animals aren't involved in a persons diet. A good idea would be encouraging more vegetarian days into a persons life who doesn't want to be compeltley vegetarian.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While the environment, animal welfare and our health would benefit from more people choosing to be vegetarian or vegan, we agree that this choice is a personal one and should not be forced upon people. Instead we think people should be educated on the benefits of eating less meat so that they can make informed decisions, and have the option of incorporating more vegetarian and vegan days into their diets.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Some people have the view that it would be best if people were all vegetarian or vegan, because it would reduce greenhouse gases, reduce water wastage and overall be better for the environment and the world. On the other hand, some people have the view that it is an individual choice, and that they enjoy eating meat and would not like to be vegetarian. Our group believe that it is an individual choice, and that vegetarianism and veganism should be encouraged, but not forced upon people. It is healthier and more carbon friendly to be vegetarian or vegan, and there are many benefits, however, the choice should still be left to the individual.
