# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of giving children computers at the age of 6.  The general feeling was that it would be a waste of money, and that children should be outside playing and being active.  However, the group did concede that there are some families that cannot afford a computer, and that this is something that needs to be addressed.  The group felt that there are more important things that the government needs to address before handing out free computers.  The group also felt that computer training programs should be set up in all schools so that all children can learn how to use a computer in a safe manner by the age of 6 so that they may be more successful in higher education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of giving children computers at the age of 6.  The general feeling was that it would be a waste of money, and that children should be outside playing and being active.  However, the group did concede that there are some families that cannot afford a computer, and that this is something that needs to be addressed.  The group felt that there are more important things that the government needs to address before handing out free computers.  However, the group also felt that children should be taught how to use a computer at the age of 6, and that it would be a good idea for schools to have a computer lab in which children can learn how to use a computer in a safe environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should be taught how to use computers from the age of 6, but they should not be given a free computer.  There are more important things for the government to address.  It is also important to note that there are some families that cannot afford a computer, and that this is something that needs to be addressed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Final consensus statement: While it would be expensive, it would be a good idea to allow schools to give computers to low-income families who cannot afford their own.  The children may be tempted by pornography and other objectionable material but this can be minimised with careful parental guidance.
