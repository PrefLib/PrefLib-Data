# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Children should be taught about the bible in school because it is an important part of western culture. This should be taught as a cultural and historical aspect rather than as a factual truth and should not be taught as part of a religious education. It should also be taught alongside all other religious books and cultures to avoid the impression that Christianity is the only religion. Furthermore, the bible teaches important principles that should be understood by children in order to gain a holistic education. For instance, the bible teaches children to treat others with respect and not to lie, both important values to have. This does not mean children should be taught to believe in God, however, they should be given the opportunity to explore all religions in order to understand the world better and avoid discrimination of different cultures. This statement was agreed by all participants.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Children should be taught about the bible in school in order to gain a better understanding of other cultures and religions. It should be taught as a cultural and historical aspect rather than as a factual truth and should not be taught as part of a religious education. In the UK, the bible should be taught in addition to the Koran because of the influence Christianity has had on history in this country. Furthermore, the bible teaches important principles that should be understood by children in order to gain a holistic education. For instance, the bible teaches children to treat others with respect and not to lie, both important values to have. This does not mean children should be taught to believe in God, however, they should be given the opportunity to explore all religions in order to understand the world better and avoid discrimination of different cultures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Children should be taught about the bible in school. The bible can be taught as an important cultural and historical text, which teaches important principles and values that all children should understand and follow. This does not mean children should be forced to believe in god and it does not mean teaching about the bible should form the basis of a religious education, as this would be extremely divisive. However, teaching about the bible in conjunction with other religious books, in order to ensure children are educated about all different cultures and avoid discrimination, is highly valuable in children's education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Children should be taught about the bible in school because it is an important part of culture in western countries, even if some do not believe in it. This should be taught as a cultural and historical aspect rather than as a factual truth and should not be taught as part of a religious education. It should also be taught alongside all other religious books and cultures to avoid the impression that Christianity is the only religion. Furthermore, the bible teaches important principles that should be understood by children in order to gain a holistic education. For instance, the bible teaches children to treat others with respect and not to lie, both important values to have. This does not mean children should be taught to believe in God, however, they should be given the opportunity to explore all religions in order to understand the world better and avoid discrimination of different cultures.
