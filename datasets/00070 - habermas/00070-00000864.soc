# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that a free driving licence check-up for people over 50 is a good idea. We believe that this is an age when people are more susceptible to health issues that may impact on their driving ability. Therefore, we believe that the proposal will help to keep people safer on the roads and reduce the number of accidents. We believe that the proposal is a good use of resources and will help to keep people safe on the roads. We believe that the proposal is a good idea, however, it should be compulsory for people over 50 to have a driving licence check-up every year. This is because, if the check-up is not compulsory, people who are not good drivers will not take up the offer of a free check-up. This means that the proposal will not be as effective as it could be.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of the proposal but with the proviso that the check-up should be mandatory for all drivers and not just those over 50. The group felt that the proposal was a good idea and would be a good use of resources, especially if the check-up was mandatory and not just an option for drivers. The group also felt that it was a good idea to have a check-up every year as it would ensure that any medical conditions or any other problems that could lead to accidents were spotted early and the driver could be advised accordingly. The group also felt that the age of 50 was too high and that it should be lowered to around 40 or 45.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of the idea of free driving licence check-ups for all people over the age of 50. The main reasons for this were that many people over 50 may not be aware of their own deteriorating physical and mental abilities. Many people over 50 may be reluctant to have their driving ability tested because of the cost, and the group felt that a free check-up would be beneficial in this respect. However, the group also felt that it would be important to stress that the check-up should not be compulsory, but that it should be made clear that it is in the best interests of all road users that people over 50 should avail of the free check-up. The group also felt that the check-up should not be made available to all people over 50, but should be available to all people over a certain age, such as 55. The main reason for this was that people in their 50s are generally more physically and mentally able than people in their 60s, 70s and 80s, and therefore the group felt that it would be more beneficial to focus on the older age group.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In principle, the idea of a free driving licence check-up for all people over the age of 50 is a good one. However, we feel that this idea is flawed in its execution and that it would not have the desired effect of improving road safety. The age of 50 is not necessarily a time when a person's driving ability is compromised. For many, the reverse is true, and this would be a waste of resources. For those who are having problems with their driving, we feel that it would be more effective to make it a mandatory thing, with the cost of the licence renewal being higher for those who do not have a check-up. This would provide an incentive for those who need to have a check-up to do so. The other issue is that the check-up would have to be mandatory, otherwise those who are having problems with their driving will not do it, and will continue to be a danger on the roads.
