# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: While the UK economy is strong, some of its people live in poverty and cannot maintain a decent standard of living. This is an issue that should be addressed and addressed soon, as people living in poverty are more likely to commit crimes, have mental health issues, become ill and suffer from poor nutrition. A standard of living which is acceptable for the rich and the middle classes should be extended to those living in poverty. This can be done by reducing the level of taxation for low paid workers, and by ensuring that employers pay a living wage. The national health service and the benefits system need to be improved to give better help to those living in poverty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Poverty in the UK is a problem and we need to address it. Some people live below what the government call the "acceptable minimum". The richest people in the UK hoard wealth, while some live in poverty. Britain is one of the richest countries in the world and so more needs to be done for the poorest in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Final consensus statement: While the UK economy is strong, some of its people live in poverty and cannot maintain a decent standard of living. This is an issue that should be addressed and addressed soon, as people living in poverty are more likely to commit crimes, have mental health issues, become ill and suffer from poor nutrition. A standard of living which is acceptable for the rich and the middle classes should be extended to those living in poverty. This can be done by reducing the level of taxation for low paid workers, and by ensuring that employers pay a living wage. Those unable to work should receive adequate support from the benefits system. The national health service should be improved to give better help to those living in poverty.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Poverty is an issue that needs to be addressed. The UK economy is strong enough to allow for more resources to be put into making life better for people who live in poverty. Taxation for low income earners needs to be reduced, and a living wage needs to be introduced so that people do not have to rely on benefits to get by. The national health service and the benefits system need to be improved to give better help to those living in poverty.
