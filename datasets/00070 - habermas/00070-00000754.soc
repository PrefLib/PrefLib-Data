# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of banning cars from cities. The opinion of the group was that it would be very difficult to implement, and that public transport would need to be improved significantly for it to be a viable option.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Cars should not be banned from cities.  Public transport is not good enough in most cities to allow people to get where they need to be.  The cities rely on the money that people spend in the city.  There are not enough taxis to allow people to get around and many people rely on their cars to get to work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a ban on petrol and diesel cars from cities.  Electric cars should be allowed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, petrol and diesel cars should not be banned from cities as people need to get to the city for work and shopping.  It is important to the local economy.
