# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should apply to rejoin the European Union as soon as possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the UK rejoining the EU. The main reasons for this were that the UK had already voted to leave the EU and it would be undemocratic to hold another referendum. It was also felt that the UK had already made a lot of progress in negotiating new trade deals and would lose this progress if it were to rejoin the EU. The EU was also seen as a protectionist organisation that was not in the best interests of the UK. However, it was recognised that there were some benefits to EU membership, such as free movement of people and the ability to influence EU policy. It was also recognised that there were some drawbacks to leaving the EU, such as the potential for a hard border in Ireland and the loss of influence in Europe. It was felt that the UK should continue to negotiate new trade deals with the EU and the rest of the world and that it should not rejoin the EU in the near future.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should not apply to rejoin the European Union as it would be an act of bad faith to the British people and would be an act of bad faith to the EU, who have been shown to be less than friendly to the UK and its people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “There should be a second referendum for the UK to rejoin the EU. However, it should be a long time before we have one, so that the consequences of Brexit are clear to the public, and to the next generation who have not voted. If the younger generation were to vote to rejoin the EU, then that decision should be enacted immediately. But if they vote to leave, then the UK will have to continue with the decision to leave the EU, with no further chance of rejoining in the future.”
