# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, the government should not restrict the amount of money people can earn. This is because, if a person works hard they should be rewarded financially. This will motivate others to work hard to increase their own wealth. In addition, putting restrictions on the amount of money people can earn is an infringement on freedom and may result in inequality as some will be able to earn more than others.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We should not limit the amount of money that people can earn, and that there are other ways in which to reduce inequality in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to placing restrictions on the amount of money people can earn in order to reduce inequality. This is because people should be allowed to get as much as they can for their skills and hard work. Those who have the ability to earn more than others should not be restricted. If we restrict someone who is earning more than others, it would create problems such as people migrating to another country where they can earn more and a lack of interest in working hard and achieving.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People should not be restricted on the amount they earn. No one should have the right to tell people how much they should earn. If they work hard and show dedication they should be able to earn as much as they can. Putting a cap on the amount people can earn will only increase a sense of inequality and would be unfair on those who want to work hard and get what they deserve. To sum up, no cap should be put on the amount people can earn.
