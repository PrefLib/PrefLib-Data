# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No. It is not a necessary piece of information to be disclosed to the employer.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Employers should be allowed to ask job applicants for their credit score but not their credit history as this is a good indicator of their credit worthiness and how well the applicant can manage finances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, we do not think employers should be allowed to ask for job applicants credit score. While it is a good indication of an applicants financial capability, we feel that it could be unfair to those with poor credit scores who may be a good applicant for the role.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Employers should not be allowed to ask job applicants for their credit score. A job applicant's credit score is not a reliable indicator of how successful that person would be in a job.
