# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The sale of alcohol should be controlled, but not banned. Alcohol is often seen as a problem but people must take responsibility for their own actions. There are currently laws surrounding alcohol to ensure that people are not over served and should be educated enough to know their limits and how much is too much. We do not think that the sale of alcohol should be banned, but rather it should be regulated and be made illegal to sell to those who are already intoxicated. We do not think that banning the sale of alcohol will have any affect on people's behaviour, but rather their own self control. We do not think that there will be a black market for alcohol, as if the sale of alcohol is banned there will be more people that want to sell it on the black market. However, there will be more people trying to buy it on the black market, therefore creating more problems. It is better to regulate alcohol than ban it, as it is such a part of society. We believe that people are responsible enough to regulate themselves and they should not be told what they can and cannot drink.

There are currently laws surrounding alcohol to ensure that people are not over served and should be educated enough to know their limits and how much is too much. Whilst the laws surrounding the sale of alcohol should not be changed, we do not think that the sale of alcohol should be banned. People are responsible enough to regulate themselves and they should not be told what they can and cannot drink.  Crime in Glasgow is always shown to the people in the country on the news. It will make you believe that Glasgow is a very dangerous place, but having lived here for twenty years, I have never witnessed any actual crime. - Participant Four
