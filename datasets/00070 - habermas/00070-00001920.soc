# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a small tax on meat. It should not be too high so as to discourage people from eating meat, but should be high enough so that people are aware of the fact that meat is contributing to climate change. The tax should be revenue neutral, meaning that the revenue raised from the tax should go toward creating sustainable alternatives such as plant based meat. This way, it will help protect the environment and incentivize people to buy plant based meat instead.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We have come to the decision that there should be an increased tax on meat. We think that this will help to reduce the consumption of meat and therefore the negative effects that it has on the environment. We think that this will also help to improve peoples health by encouraging them to eat more plant based foods. We think that this tax should be a small tax, maybe 1%, and should be applied to all meat. We think that this tax should be used to fund the NHS and to fund research into more sustainable alternatives to meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There should be a tax on meat, but it should be a small tax, and the money should go to research into alternatives to meat.
