# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I believe that we should always encourage people to learn. Learning is for everyone and is the key to opening minds. However I do not believe that people should be put under pressure to get a degree and I also believe that a degree is not suitable for everyone. There are many benefits to gaining a degree such as improved job prospects, higher salary, meeting new people, gaining new skills and a greater knowledge. However there are also downsides to gaining a degree such as the large amount of debt which is put upon people, the university fees are extremely expensive and unfair, and the stress and hard work which comes with a degree. For many people the pros may outweigh the cons however for some the cons may outweigh the pros. I think this question is a personal choice and a decision which everyone should make for themselves.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that learning is important for everyone, however, people should make their own choice about going to university. People can and should be encouraged to learn but not pushed into a very expensive degree which does not suit them. An excellent education from a young age could mean that the need for a degree is not so necessary in some peoples lives. Critical thinking, as an academic discipline, began in the nineteenth century as a response to the `war' between science and religion. There is an assumption that the `two cultures' of science and the humanities are fundamentally opposed. Are religion and science mutually exclusive? This group was tasked with finding a consensus answer. Here is their question, their individual opinions, their draft consensus statement, the critiques of their draft statement, and their final consensus statement.
