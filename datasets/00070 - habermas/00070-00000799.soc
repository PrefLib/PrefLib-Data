# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We believe that the UK should have a national language. We believe that English should be the national language of the UK. This is because we believe that it would be good to have a language that is common throughout the UK. We believe that it is important to have a common language to prevent any confusion and to ensure that everyone is able to understand each other. We believe that it is important to keep the English language alive as it is the language of the majority of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The UK should have a specific national language and that language should be English. The UK is a very diverse place and having a national language would help to unite the country. English is the language most commonly spoken in the UK, so it makes sense for it to be the national language. There are some people in the UK whose first language is not English, but the country is becoming more diverse and it is important that everyone has a good knowledge of English. The UK is a multicultural society and it is important to promote and preserve the other languages of the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the UK should have a specific national language. However, the language that is chosen should be the one that the majority of people in the UK use. The national language should be English as it is the most widely spoken language in the UK. The English language is constantly changing and evolving. We should aim to preserve and promote other languages such as Welsh, Gaelic and Irish, but we should also ensure that people who do not have English as their first language are not disadvantaged. We believe that a good knowledge of English is one of the foundations for success in the UK, regardless of who you are or where you come from.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the UK should have a specific national language. This should be English as it is the most commonly spoken language and is a language which is spoken throughout the world. There are varieties of the English language, but we should aim to promote a standardised version of English. We also believe that it is important to preserve languages such as Welsh, Irish and Gaelic, but we believe that English should be the national language of the UK.
