# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: we believe that we should allow people from other countries to come and work in the UK.  We should also try to make it as easy as possible for them to do so and obtain the correct visa if necessary. The group were given a toolkit, which they had to use in order to reach the consensus view above.  They also were able to comment on the usefulness of the toolkit itself.  Here are some of their comments: "I really liked the part where we had to work out what we agreed on and then what we didn't agree on.  I think that this is a really useful part of the toolkit and really helped us come to a consensus view.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that it is important to allow people from other countries to come and work in the UK.  Our country has been built on immigration and is a melting pot of different cultures, languages and religions.  We need to allow immigrants to come to the UK as they fill gaps in our labour markets and also help our country become more culturally diverse.  This creates a more inclusive society and helps us understand each other and form a better view of the world.  Immigrants can also bring new skills and talents to the UK and this can help us become more successful in a global world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should allow people from other countries to come and work in the UK.  We were built on immigration and the NHS would not be able to survive without it now or in the past.  There are also jobs which are crucial to the economy which we rely on immigrants to fill.  Having people from lots of different countries working here adds to the diversity of the workplace and is a good thing.  It brings a diverse range of skills and talents to the workforce, enriching the economy.  It can fill in gaps in our labour markets.  Also it can promote cultural exchange and understanding.  Immigration can boost productivity and entrepreneurship.  We can encourage a global outlook creating a vibrant, inclusive society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “Yes, we should allow people from other countries to come and work in the UK.  It is important to the economy and to the diversity of our workforce.  It is also important to remember that many of us are immigrants ourselves or have immigrant parents and grandparents and that immigration is a vital part of the history of the UK.”
