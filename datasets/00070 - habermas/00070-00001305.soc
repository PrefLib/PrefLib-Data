# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “We don’t believe that the minimum wage should be lowered. People who are earning minimum wage are already struggling to make ends meet. It is true that the minimum wage was set by the government, and it is possible that the government would increase the number of jobs by lowering the minimum wage. However, we feel that these jobs would not pay enough for people to meet their basic needs, which would mean that the government would have to provide more financial assistance to these people, which would result in higher taxes and less pay for everyone else. Furthermore, it's also possible that a reduction in the minimum wage could result in lower wages for people who are already making more than minimum wage. In the end, the situation would remain the same for everyone except those people who are making the lowest wages.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The minimum wage should not be lowered. The minimum wage is barely a living wage as it is, and if it was lowered any further, people would have to work even more hours than they already are, which in many cases, simply won't be sustainable.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No, the minimum wage should not be lowered to make jobs more available. People who are paid minimum wage are already struggling to make ends meet, and lowering their pay would only make their situation worse. It is important to remember that minimum wage is not a luxury, but a necessity. It is the bare minimum that people need to be able to afford basic necessities like food and housing. The idea that lowering the minimum wage would create more jobs is also highly questionable, as it is not clear how this would happen. If anything, it is more likely that lowering the minimum wage would lead to employers paying people even less than they already are, as this would be a way for them to save money.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although lowering the minimum wage could make jobs more available, it would also mean that these jobs would be less desirable, as they would offer wages that are not enough to live on. As a result, these jobs would often go unfilled, which would defeat the purpose of lowering the minimum wage in the first place.
