# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I believe that the UK should increase taxes on high income earners. There is too large a gap between the rich and the poor. The UK should create a tax system that means everyone contributes their fair share. To do this we need to increase the rate of income tax for high earners and reduce it for low earners. This will also create a disincentive for tax evasion. This will allow us to increase the amount of funding available for the NHS and other public services.” A final note on our group consensus is that although we all have our own views on the matter we all agree that the country needs to be moving in the right direction to ensure the health of its citizens and the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The country needs to be more progressive and we need to see an increase in tax on high income earners, however we should be careful not to raise the threshold too high as this will deter business and innovation. The tax should be ring fenced for specific areas such as health, education, public sector employment and infrastructure to prevent it being spent on anything else. The government should clamp down on tax loopholes and ensure that tax avoiders are harshly dealt with. In addition, they suggested that the questions should be followed by an explanation and justification of the opinion as this would allow them to get to the heart of the discussion and really understand each other's views.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should increase taxes for high earners as it will increase the quality of life for those who need it the most.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Income tax in the UK is among the lowest in Europe. The current tax system is iniquitous and no longer fit for purpose. There should be a change to the tax system that includes: - an increase in the rate of CGT; - an increase in the rate of inheritance tax; - a removal of the tax free allowance for those earning more than £150,000 per annum. Any such increase should not discourage those high earners who are creating jobs and wealth in the country.
