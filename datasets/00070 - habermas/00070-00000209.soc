# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we should not ban tax-free shopping. It can provide an opportunity for consumers to save money on purchases they might not be able to afford otherwise. Also, it can be a source of revenue as tax-free shopping can generate revenue for retailers and governments through various fees and commissions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Although tax free shopping can be a great opportunity for consumers to save money, the fact that it can generate revenue for retailers and governments means that it should not be banned. However, the group of participants recommended that it should be made easier for consumers to know when tax-free shopping is available to them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, we do not think tax-free shopping should be banned but we agree that in some cases, taxing should be more comprehensive and universal. The group felt that in many cases tax-free shopping is an important factor for the tourism industry as it promotes international tourism and offers visitors the opportunity to shop without having to worry about tax. The group felt that a solution could be to limit the amount that visitors can spend tax-free per year. For example, it could be that people could shop tax-free up to £5000 per year but anything over that amount would be taxed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a ban on tax-free shopping.
