# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, a country should have a strong military. This is because the world is a dangerous place and we need to be prepared for any threats that may arise. A strong military is also needed to protect the country's interests abroad and to defend the country's borders. A strong military also advances technology significantly faster compared to not as we are constantly trying to one up the enemy. However, a country should not have an insanely huge military and should not proceed to try go to war with whoever, whenever. It is all about preventing and dealing with threats when they arise, but not causing problems and acting on violence/causing violence for no reason and not being the threat to other countries either. No military or a weak military doesn't really work as there needs to be enough strength to protect the country and its people, but not so large that it can literally crush any opposition regardless of what is right and/or fair.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - A country should have a strong enough military to protect its people and its boarders. The strength of the military should be proportionate to the threats it faces. A country should not use its military to invade other countries or attack them without reason. A country should not have a military that is so strong that it can crush any opposition regardless of what is right and/or fair. A country should not have a military that is so weak that it cannot protect its people and its boarders. A country should not have a military that is so weak that it cannot prevent and deal with threats when they arise.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - A country should have a strong military. A country should have a strong military because there are always threats in the world and we need to be ready to deal with them. We live in a dangerous world and we need to be able to protect ourselves from threats. The world is always changing and we need to be able to adapt to that change. We also need to be able to protect our allies and the people that are under our protection. A strong military is also a deterrent. If we have a strong military, then people will think twice before attacking us. We also need a strong military to protect our interests. We need to be able to protect our way of life and our interests. We also need to be able to protect our borders and our boarder regions. A strong military also creates jobs and helps the economy. It is also a sign of strength.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, a country should have a strong military. The world is a dangerous place and a country needs to be able to defend itself from threats, both external and internal. A strong military can also act as a deterrent to other countries that may have aggressive intentions. A strong military also allows a country to participate in humanitarian efforts and provide aid to countries that are in need. A strong military also allows a country to participate in peacekeeping missions and provide security to countries that are experiencing civil unrest.
