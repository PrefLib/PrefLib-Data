# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In conclusion, we believe that the amount of people moving in and out of the UK should be equal and we don't want to be relying on other countries to get the work done that we don't have the resources for. We also believe that the costs to immigrate to the UK are very high, and that we should try and reduce the cost as much as possible, in order to increase the amount of people moving to the UK to contribute to the economy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We have a number of immigrants from all over the world and I think we should allow more people to come to the UK. Immigrants bring their skills, abilities and experiences with them to our country. Some come to study, some come to find jobs and some come to seek refuge from their war-torn countries. We should not make it difficult for people from other countries to immigrate to the UK because that would give a bad image of our country. We should not be judgemental about the immigrants because they are humans just like us. We should have compassion for people who are less fortunate and help them, and that includes welcoming them into our country and giving them a chance to live a better life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We should make it easier for people to immigrate to the UK, however there needs to be certain requirements to ensure that the immigrants are legally here and not going to abuse the systems in place. Also the government needs to ensure that there are enough resources to cope with any increase in immigration.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the United Kingdom is an attractive destination for immigrants. The United Kingdom is a great country with a stable economy, an unrivaled political system, and is generally very safe. However, we must make sure that the citizens of the UK are taken care of first and foremost. Immigration has always been good for the UK as it helps us innovate, grow, and prosper. However, the government must not be too lenient. For example, it should not be so easy to move to the UK that everyone in the world wants to come to the UK. Immigration should not be too easy as to discourage immigration, but it should be easy enough to attract talent to the UK. The costs of immigrating to the UK should not be cut as they help deter illegal immigration and help attract talent.
