# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK needs a minimum price for alcohol. Alcohol companies need to be punished for their irresponsible advertising, targeting the youth and making alcohol seem appealing. However, the price must be minimal so that young people are not forced to buy alcohol on the black market, which could potentially lead to the use of dangerous substances.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We don't think that the UK needs a minimum price for alcohol, as we believe that the price is already high enough and that the price would only be raised to an extent that would be unfair to the consumer. Instead, we believe that the government should be focusing on the health and safety of the consumer, and that they should be focusing on the retailers and sellers of alcohol, as this is where the problem lies. We also believe that the sellers of alcohol should be more heavily fined if they are caught selling to underage children, as this is where the problem lies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of minimum pricing. This is because we felt that people should be allowed to buy what they want and that the price of alcohol is already high enough. The only people who would benefit from minimum pricing would be alcoholics, and even then, we do not think that it would be beneficial for their health. This is because they are addicted, so they will find any way possible to afford their habit.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In my opinion the UK does not need a minimum price of alcohol. We all believe that the UK already has strict rules when it comes to selling alcohol to minors and is only becoming stricter. However we also believe that the government and retailers should do more in ensuring that these rules are adhered to. We also believe that the UK is becoming a nanny state and by enforcing a minimum price for alcohol we are removing the freedom for the consumer to decide what they want to buy, and that is why we believe that the UK does not need a minimum price of alcohol.
