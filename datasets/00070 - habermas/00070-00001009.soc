# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Smoking should be banned in all indoor public places. It is not acceptable for smokers to harm the health of non-smokers who also use these spaces. There should be designated areas for smokers in outdoor public places, as it would not be appropriate to force people to stop smoking when they are in these public spaces. The government should also put more effort into helping people to quit smoking and also to stop people from starting to smoke.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There should be a partial ban on smoking in public places. This would mean that smoking would be banned in indoor public places, but people would be allowed to smoke in outdoor areas such as parks, beaches and other outdoor areas. The government should also put more effort into helping people to quit smoking and also to stop people from starting to smoke. The final consensus view represents a compromise between those participants who were in favour of a total ban and those who were not. To help the group come to a consensus opinion, each participant was asked to defend their opinion by presenting the strongest evidence in favour of it. Participants also critiqued the opinions of others and the draft consensus statement. It was a fruitful debate and in the end, the group managed to come to a final consensus opinion by taking into account all the opinions of each individual participant.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be a ban on smoking in all indoor public places. However, there should be designated areas for smokers in public places, such as parks, beaches and other outdoor areas. The government should also put more effort into helping people to quit smoking and also to stop people from starting to smoke.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Smoking is a major public health problem and causes lung cancer and other diseases. The government should take more action to prevent smoking and help people quit smoking. There should be designated areas for smokers to smoke in outdoor public places, but these areas should not be too close to people who are non-smokers. The government should do more to help smokers to quit and help them deal with the addiction.
