# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should absolutely grant the Caribbean islands their independence. However, it is vital that this does not involve a mass of new legislation or be a complex process. This is because these islands may not have the expertise or resources to deal with such an undertaking. Instead, a referendum of the islands should be held, and their consensus should be adhered to. If the islands desire independence, then this should be granted to them. If the islands wish to stay as they are, then the UK should continue to provide them with the resources and support they have become accustomed to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the UK should give independence to the remaining colonies in the Caribbean. This is because the UK has a history of forcing people into the empire, and this is something that we should not continue to do. We should not force people to be part of the UK if they do not want to be. However, this does not mean that we should cut off all ties with these countries. The UK should continue to provide support to these countries where it is wanted, and we should also consider reparations for slavery and resources that we have taken away from them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the UK's remaining colonies in the Caribbean should be given their independence. However, this does not mean that we should cut them off, or stop providing support where they would still like to receive it. Similarly, we think that we should consider whether they are due reparations for slavery and resources that we have taken away from them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Ultimately, the UK should give independence to the remaining colonies in the Caribbean, provided they want it. This is something that can be negotiated in an equal partnership between the Caribbean and the UK. This does not mean cutting ties with the Caribbean but giving them the freedom to go if they want to. The UK should also consider whether they are due reparations for slavery and resources that we have taken away from them.
