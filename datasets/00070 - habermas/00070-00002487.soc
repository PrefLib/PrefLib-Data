# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, we should not replace income tax with an additional value added tax on goods and services. We believe that income tax is a reliable and long established form of tax and that it would be a mistake to replace it with VAT. We believe that VAT would be a burden on businesses and that it could cause companies to go bankrupt. We believe that the economy would be at risk if VAT was introduced. We believe that the current system of income tax is fair and that it reflects the amount of money that people earn. We believe that VAT would be unfair as it would not reflect the amount of money that people earn. We believe that VAT would be a burden on people as they would have to pay more for goods and services. We believe that people would have less money to spend and save as they would have to pay more VAT. We believe that it would be a mistake to replace income tax with VAT.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “No, we should not replace the income tax with an additional value added tax (VAT) on goods and services. The VAT is already a burden on the economy and if we increase this burden we would find many companies going bankrupt. Income tax is a reliable source of income for the government and it is a long established system that has been in place for many years. It has proven to be a good foundation of tax and we need to be cautious about creating additional tax modifications. This would prove disastrous for the economy.”

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of replacing the income tax with an additional value added tax (VAT) on goods and services. The income tax is a very old system that was created in a very different world to the one we live in now. It is a very inefficient and complex system that is very difficult to understand. It has become a very divisive system that creates a great deal of inequality in society. The additional value added tax on goods and services would be a much more efficient and simpler system that would be much easier to understand. It would also be a more fair system that would help to reduce inequality in society. It would be a much more efficient system that would help to boost economic growth and would be much easier to administer. It would also help to encourage a more sustainable society.
