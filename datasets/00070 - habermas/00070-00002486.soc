# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the minimum wage for workers under 18 should be increased. In wealthy countries, the government has a responsibility to ensure that people do not fall below the floor in their living conditions. As the current government says a job is the best way to help people. I expand that to say that a job with a minimum wages and conditions is what people should expect in a civilised society. The government should introduce higher minimum wages for those under 18. It is not fair if those under 18 do the same job as someone over 18 but get paid less. The wage should match the work done independent of age. I think everybody deserves fair pay. As inflation is still exceptionally high I believe the minimum wage for under eighteens should be increased in line with this. People of this age however probably do not have the same expenses as people who are older than this and I suspect still really on support from their parents but even so should be rewarded for their work and encouraged to progress in  life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the decision that we think the minimum wage for workers under 18 should be increased. We think this because of the current situation and the cost of living crisis. This would help them with increasing costs. We also think that the minimum wage for under 18’s should be increased because it is not fair if those under 18 do the same job as someone over 18 but get paid less. The wage should match the work done independent of age. We also think that everybody deserves fair pay. As inflation is still exceptionally high we believe the minimum wage for under 18’s should be increased in line with this. People of this age however probably do not have the same expenses as people who are older than this and we suspect are still really on support from their parents but even so should be rewarded for their work and encouraged to progress in life. We also think that the government has a responsibility to ensure that people do not fall below the floor in their living conditions. As the current government says a job is the best way to help people. We expand that to say that a job with a minimum wages and conditions is what people should expect in a civilised society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We agree that the government should introduce a higher minimum wage for workers under 18. The current situation is that there is a cost of living crisis and the government has a responsibility to ensure that people do not fall below the poverty line in their living conditions. A job is the best way to help people, but a job with a minimum wage and conditions is what people should expect in a civilised society. We believe that everybody deserves fair pay. As inflation is still exceptionally high we believe that the minimum wage for under eights should be increased in line with this. People of this age however probably do not have the same expenses as people who are older than this and we suspect still really on support from their parents but even so should be rewarded for their work and encouraged to progress in life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We agree that the government should introduce a higher minimum wage for workers under 18. The current situation is that there is a cost of living crisis and the government has a responsibility to ensure that people do not fall below the poverty line in their living conditions. A job is the best way to help people, but a job with a minimum wage and conditions is what people should expect in a civilised society. We believe that everybody deserves fair pay. As inflation is still exceptionally high we believe that the minimum wage for under 18s should be increased in line with this. People of this age however probably do not have the same expenses as people who are older than this and we suspect still rely on support from their parents but even so should be rewarded for their work and encouraged to progress in life.
