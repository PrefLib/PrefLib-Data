# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was very disappointed with Theresa May's performance as Prime Minister. The group felt that she was too weak when it came to negotiations with the EU and failed to come to an agreement with them. The group also felt that she did poorly when it came to the 2017 general election and lost her majority. Finally, the group felt that she didn't deal with the Grenfell Tower fire in a reasonable way. The group felt that the only good thing that Theresa May did was that she was honest and not corrupt like the Prime Ministers who followed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “May was not a good prime minister. She was weak when it came to negotiations with the EU and failed to come to an agreement with them. She also did poorly when it came to the 2017 general election and lost her majority. Finally, she didn't deal with the Grenfell Tower fire in a reasonable way. May was a terrible prime minister who only lasted a few weeks. She supported Brexit which was a bad thing. May was ousted by her own party who had no confidence in her. The only good thing was she was not corrupt like the Prime ministers who followed”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, Theresa May was not a good prime minister. She only lasted a few weeks as prime minister and yet she still managed to tank the economy. She attempted to backtrack on her disastrous mini budget but that made things even worse. She supported Brexit which was a bad thing too. She was also too weak when it came to negotiations with the EU and failed to come to an agreement with them. She also did poorly when it came to the 2017 general election and lost her majority. Finally, she didn't deal with the Grenfell Tower fire in a reasonable way.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Theresa May was a bad Prime Minister. She was not able to provide the leadership required for such an important role.
