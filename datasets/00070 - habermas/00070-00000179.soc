# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Car manufacturers are responsible for the emissions their cars produce. Car manufacturers have to meet emission standards, if they are to sell cars in a particular country. If a car is a significant pollutant, this will be highlighted by independent bodies and the car manufacturer will be held accountable. Car manufacturers are also in a position to innovate and research new technology and improvements in the manufacturing process, in order to create low-emission vehicles. If the car manufacturer doesn't take this approach, then it is up to the customer to decide if they want to purchase this particular vehicle.
