# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that it is not a good idea to further reduce taxation on corporations. This is because they already benefit from various tax loopholes and scandals, further reducing their tax burden would allow inequality and hinder economic progress. We believe that it is a good idea to reduce taxation on small, new independent companies to give them more chance to succeed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It is not a good idea to further reduce taxation on corporations. If they cannot pay their current rate, then something must be wrong and I think that tax loopholes and tax avoidance is a major issue. Some corporations also pollute our environment and take advantage of their workers, and so they need to contribute more to our society. They also avoid paying tax on many accounts and use complex methods to avoid paying as much tax as they should. We don't believe that the government should lower their taxes further, especially as it will mean that those who pay tax and work hard will have to contribute even more to our economy and society. Discussion questions: (a) Identify three different types of consensus mentioned in this exercise. (b) What factors can influence the extent to which a person is willing to participate in a group consensus exercise? (c) What is the role of each individual participant in this exercise? (d) Describe two strategies that could be used to encourage participants to reach a consensus view. (e) Describe one limitation of this exercise.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We have come to the decision that it is not a good idea to further reduce taxation on corporations. This is because they already benefit from various tax loopholes and scandals, further reducing their tax burden would allow inequality and hinder economic progress. We also believe that they should be paying more tax to give back to the economy as they contribute to slave work and to the emission of toxic gas into the atmosphere.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is not a good idea to further reduce taxation on corporations. If they pay less in taxes, the government will not be able to invest in services that benefit the people and corporations may invest in tax havens abroad. It would therefore be a bad idea to reduce their tax burden.
