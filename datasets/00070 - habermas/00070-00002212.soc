# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “No, I don’t think people should be allowed to own as many guns as they want. I think that guns should only be held by those who are trained to use them in the correct way and who have a valid reason for owning a gun. I think that there should be stricter laws regarding gun ownership and licensing to own guns.  I think this is because I think that guns can be dangerous, and in the wrong hands can be extremely harmful to society.  There are a lot of incidents in America where people have been shot in mass shootings, as well as shootings by police, who also own guns.  This suggests to me that it can be very dangerous to own guns, and we should have strict regulations in place to ensure that they do not fall into the wrong hands, or cause unnecessary deaths.  I also think that there should be a thorough mental health check, as well as a background check to make sure that they are not a danger to themselves or society.  This should be regularly reviewed, to ensure that they are still fit to own a gun.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “No, we do not believe that people should be allowed to own as many guns as they want, without valid reason.  To own a gun is a huge responsibility and we feel there needs to be strict guidelines for gun owners, which includes being trained, licensed and having regular mental health checks. We feel these laws are in place to protect society, from unnecessary harm, which can be caused by guns.  With no strict regulations in place, guns could be owned by the wrong people, or used in the wrong way, which could lead to mass harm in society. We need these regulations in place, to prevent guns from causing too much harm, and to protect society.”

I think we should look at countries like America and see what has gone wrong, and how we can ensure that this does not happen in the UK.  This could be by requiring strict background checks before someone is allowed to own a gun, and also by making sure that people have to go through training before they are allowed to own a gun, so they know how to use it safely and correctly.
