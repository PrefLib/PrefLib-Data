# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The UK is more liberal than the US as a whole, although there are liberal and conservative traits in both countries. The US is more conservative than the UK due to the role of religion in society and the impact it has on individuals, who must adhere to strict Christian rules. There are, however, liberal traits in the US, such as the large gay community and the fairly new laws allowing gay marriage. The UK is less religious than the US, although still has a large Christian population. There are many liberal traits in the UK, with a large multicultural population and laws protecting the rights of minorities.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the UK is more liberal than the US. Religion plays a large part in society and as the US is more religious than the UK it has tended to become more conservative in recent years. The UK has also become more liberal in recent years.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The UK is generally more liberal than the US, although both have their liberal and conservative traits. The US is generally more conservative than the UK due to the large role of the Christian religion and the impact it has on the lives of individuals. The UK is less religious than the US, but has a larger liberal population, which can be seen in social attitudes, for example with the attitude to gay marriage, which is still illegal in the US. The US has also tended to become more conservative in recent years, with the introduction of restrictive laws and policies.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Although the UK is more liberal in some ways than the US, both countries have their liberal and conservative traits. The UK is generally more liberal than the US, but the US is less religious and more liberal in some areas, for example with the attitude to gay marriage, which is still illegal in the US. However, the US has also tended to become more conservative in recent years, with the introduction of restrictive laws and policies.
