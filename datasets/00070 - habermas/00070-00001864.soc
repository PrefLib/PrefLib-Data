# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Fracking should be allowed in Scotland only if absolutely necessary, if an alternative solution could be found first that would be a better option in our opinion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, we feel that the question of whether fracking should be allowed in Scotland, is a contentious issue. However, in our opinion, we feel that fracking should not be allowed in Scotland. The issue of fracking has recently been raised by communities in England, and has received an enormous amount of media attention. The research has shown that fracking can have many negative environmental impacts. This includes increased traffic, the destruction of woodlands, and the possibility of increased pollution and earth tremors. Furthermore, the extraction of fossil fuels, we feel, goes against the principle of carbon neutral and renewable energy. Therefore, we think that the research shows that there are enough environmental, social and economic reasons to ensure that fracking should not be allowed in Scotland.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In conclusion, we feel that fracking should not be allowed in Scotland. We have come to this conclusion because of the potential damage that fracking can cause to the environment. The process of fracking can cause earthquakes, which are dangerous to life. This is because they can cause damage to buildings and destroy the countryside. The process of fracking also uses fossil fuels, which are a finite resource. This means that they will run out at some point. This is why we feel that fracking should not be allowed in Scotland.
