# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of funding coal-fired power stations. They believe that coal is a dirty fuel that has a lot of negative impacts on the environment and human health. The participants all agreed that coal-fired power stations should be replaced by more environmentally friendly power generation methods, such as wind and solar power. However, the participants also agreed that coal-fired power stations should not be replaced immediately. They agreed that coal-fired power stations should be replaced as soon as more environmentally friendly power generation methods are developed and ready to take over. The participants believe that this is the best way to ensure that public charges remain low. The participants agreed that funding should be given to research and development of more environmentally friendly power generation methods. The group also agreed that the money spent on coal-fired power stations should be used to develop more environmentally friendly power generation methods.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Although coal fired power stations are an easy way to produce electricity and keep the cost of living low, they are a terrible way to do it. They are bad for the environment and also have a negative impact on the health of the people living near them. They cause air pollution and also water pollution when they are being mined. We should be funding more sustainable and environmentally friendly ways of producing electricity, such as wind, solar and wave power. This will keep the cost of living low and also keep the planet healthy and safe for future generations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of continuing to fund coal-fired power stations. The group was in agreement that this was a bad idea for the environment and for people. The group was in agreement that the resources that would be spent on coal-fired power stations should be redirected to finding cleaner ways of making energy. The group was in agreement that coal-fired power stations should be replaced with wind, solar and wave power. The group was in agreement that the money that would be spent on coal-fired power stations should be redirected to finding cleaner ways of making energy.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should continue to fund coal-fired power stations until we can afford to replace them with renewable energy sources. The impact of climate change is very real and very concerning. We must do all we can to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and it is important to note that coal-fired power stations produce a large amount of greenhouse gases. However, it is also important to remember that there are a lot of people in the world who do not have access to power. This is not only an issue of human rights, but also a security concern. If we move to a system of power generation that is too expensive, the price of power will rise and many people will not be able to afford it. This will lead to poverty, crime and instability. We need to move to renewable energy sources, but we need to do so in a way that is affordable and fair to all.
