# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The UK should continue to license the radio frequency spectrum as this ensures that there is a fair system for people to access the radio frequency spectrum and it prevents an unfair situation where a few businesses take control of the radio frequency spectrum. It also ensures that there are a variety of programmes on the radio which will allow for different groups to have their views expressed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the citizens were surprised by how much the issue of licensing the radio frequency spectrum for the public was dominated by two issues - radio and television. The citizens felt that this was narrowing the scope of the question and were keen to broaden it to include all uses of radio frequency spectrum. Once this was done the citizens felt that the UK should continue to license the radio frequency spectrum for the general public. The citizens were pleased with the idea of the 'digital dividend' that would be generated by the auctioning of parts of the radio frequency spectrum and felt that it was good to know that the public would be able to benefit from the sale of these licenses. However, the citizens felt that it would be important to ensure that the costs of these licenses was not so high that they would put off small businesses or individuals from buying a license and that any new license should not be so open to interpretation that it would allow the existing licensees to use it to drive out their competitors.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK should continue to license radio frequency spectrum for use by the general public, because it would not be fair to allow private businesses to take up the whole spectrum. The licence should be taken away if it stops being useful for the public.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The UK should continue to license the radio frequency spectrum for public use, however we do not think it is being fully utilised and should be reviewed. This should be done to avoid a waste of resource, but also to ensure that citizens continue to have access to a varied range of radio and TV broadcasting.
