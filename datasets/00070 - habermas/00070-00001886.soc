# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is acceptable to use a person's DNA to identify them as a criminal if it is proven beyond reasonable doubt that they are involved. However, DNA should not be used as the sole source of evidence. It should be used alongside other evidence that the person is a criminal, such as witness statements, CCTV footage, clothing or personal items and mobile phone data. This would ensure that it is impossible to misidentify someone using DNA evidence alone. If DNA is used to identify a criminal, it must be treated with respect and sensitivity, and only be used by the appropriate authorities. This means that the public should not be allowed to misuse DNA and incorrectly identify someone as a criminal. It is important to use the right amount of DNA to identify someone, as if too much DNA is taken, there is a chance that someone will be falsely identified as a criminal, and if not enough DNA is used, the chance of misidentification increases. DNA should only be used by appropriate authorities in the context of solving a crime. If a criminal is found guilty of a crime, and DNA is used as evidence, the criminal should not have their DNA stored on a database, unless they commit a crime in the future." This
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the use of DNA to identify a person as a criminal is acceptable. However, it is important to treat a person sensitively and with respect, following the criminal justice procedure. The use of DNA to identify a person as a criminal should be considered alongside other evidence when solving a crime.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, yes, it is acceptable to use a person's DNA to identify them as a criminal. The use of DNA to identify criminals is an effective method of solving crimes, and in some cases, it is the only way to identify the perpetrator. However, there is always the chance of human error and it is important to treat a person sensitively and with respect, following the criminal justice procedure. The use of DNA should be considered alongside other evidence when solving a crime.
