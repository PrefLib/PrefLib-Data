# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Placebos should only be prescribed in the context of a clinical trial, where there is no known cure for the illness being studied. This is to ensure that the placebo is being used for scientific purposes, and not to deny a patient effective treatment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In principle, the use of placebos is not a good idea. However, if there is no other treatment available and the patient is not in immediate danger, then a placebo could be used to help the patient. However, this should only be done if the patient is informed that they are receiving a placebo.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the prescription of placebos should be avoided. However, in some cases, such as those where a patient's symptoms are all in their head, placebos may be useful. In general, doctors should avoid prescribing placebos, unless there is no other treatment available.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, because it is unethical to give patients something that does not work. The placebo effect may work in some cases, but it is not reliable. It is also unethical to give patients false hope. The health of the patient is paramount, and we should not be giving them something that will not work.
