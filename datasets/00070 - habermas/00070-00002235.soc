# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, people should not be allowed to carry non-lethal weapons for self-defence. This is because there is a possibility that these weapons could be used in a criminal way, and also because the police should be the ones who are responsible for people's safety and security. However, it is important to note that the police should be better equipped to deal with crime, and they should be able to protect law-abiding citizens. We should also note that some non-lethal weapons, such as pepper sprays, should not cause much harm, and they could be allowed in specific situations.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, people should not be allowed to carry non-lethal weapons for self-defence. This is because there is a possibility that these weapons could be used in a criminal way. We should focus on improving the ways in which the police are able to protect law-abiding citizens, rather than giving people weapons which could possibly be used to commit crimes. But we also think that, if the police improved their equipment and bravery levels then crime would not be so high. At the same time, it is important to note that those most vulnerable to attacks are women, and so we must listen to their voices in order to come up with a consensus view on this matter.

This is because there is a possibility that these weapons could be used in a criminal way, and also because the police should be the ones who are responsible for people's safety and security. However, it is important to note that the police should be better equipped to deal with crime, and they should be able to protect law-abiding citizens. It is also important to note that not all non-lethal weapons are the same. Some are more harmless than others. Some examples of non-lethal weapons include knives, pepper spray and tasers. Final note: all participants agreed that the consensus statement should be printed and displayed in public places, such as on billboards and on public transport. This is to promote the consensus statement and to encourage people to reflect on the issue of weapons for self-defence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: People in the UK should be allowed to carry non-lethal weapons for self-defence. This is because, in many cases, it is difficult to expect people to call the police if they are being attacked. Carrying such non-lethal weapons could help people especially women protect themselves. Also, these non-lethal weapons should be restricted to some very specific options, such as pepper sprays. One of the moderators then proceeded to ask: "So... if you've read all of the questions, guess which one is being asked by the police, how many of you would like to know which one?" - All of the participants wanted to know which question was asked by the police. "Okay, how many of you feel that question 2 and 4 are appropriate to the police but would not like to know which is theirs? - No one.
