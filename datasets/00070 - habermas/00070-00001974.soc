# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Children aged 12 or below should be given detentions by their teachers if the child has behaved inappropriately and in a way that is not conducive to the learning environment of the school. Teachers should be given the freedom to use their discretion on whether or not to give a detention and the decision should be made based on the severity of the negative behaviour and the child's previous behaviour record. It is important to remember that children are still learning how to behave in school and in society and should be taught the consequences of their actions. A detention should be used as a way of teaching the child that their actions have consequences. It should also be used as an opportunity to speak to the child and find out if there are any underlying issues causing the negative behaviours. The detention could be made into a lesson, teaching children about the importance of good behaviour and how it benefits everyone involved.

This way, the child's behaviour can be targeted to fix any underlying issues to shape them into a positive citizen of society.

Teachers should not use a detention as a way to humiliate the child but instead use the detention to encourage the child to behave in a more positive way in the future.
