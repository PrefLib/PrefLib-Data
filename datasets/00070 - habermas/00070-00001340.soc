# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the consensus opinion that we should raise the minimum age to purchase tobacco to 21 but also introduce more stringent regulation and penalties for illegal supply to underage users and sellers.  The minimum age for alcohol and gambling should also be raised to 21.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: It was thought that the legal age to purchase tobacco should be raised to 21 for many reasons.  For one, the minimum age to purchase alcohol is also 21, and a lot of young people consume both alcohol and tobacco together.  Therefore, if the minimum age is raised to 21, it would make it less likely that young people will consume both together.  This could help to prevent some of the health problems associated with smoking.  In addition, young people do not fully understand the dangers of smoking.  When they do understand the dangers, they do not want to smoke, so by increasing the age to 21, it gives young people time to learn more about the dangers of smoking and therefore they may not smoke.  However, young people will still try and get their hands on tobacco, as they will see older people smoking and will therefore think that it is acceptable.  Therefore, it is thought that more should be done to raise awareness of the dangers of smoking, not just for young people but also for adults.  If young people are educated about the dangers, they are more likely to avoid smoking and so they can live a healthier lifestyle.  This will help to improve public health and reduce the burden on the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco to 21.  The majority of the group felt that at 18 young people are still children and should not be exposed to additional pressures such as smoking.  Smoking is often a gateway drug that leads to peer pressures of trying more harmful drugs.  The introduction of vapes is worrying as young people view that as fun, in the same way that their may have viewed a bag of sweets.  Smoking is harmful and can lead to peer pressures to get involved.  At age 21 peer pressure is lessened.  The group felt that at 21 a child can make clear cut decisions and take full responsibility for such decisions especially when the faced with the consequences of those decisions later in life.  The group felt that the current minimum age of 18 is used for other regulated products like alcohol and gambling, so it should stay at 18 for this reason.  The group felt that more should be done overall to discourage the purchase of tobacco for all ages though, including time limits when you can purchase it, increasing taxes and prices.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The age for the purchase of tobacco should be raised to 21.  We believe that this is an important step in preventing young people from smoking, as they will be less likely to take it up if they cannot easily purchase it.  We also believe that by raising the age to 21, this will help to reduce the amount of peer pressure on young people to take up smoking, as their friends will not be able to buy it for them.  The age of 18 is currently used for other regulated products like alcohol and gambling, so it should stay at 18 for this reason.  More should be done overall to discourage the purchase of tobacco for all ages though, including time limits when you can purchase it, increasing taxes and prices.
