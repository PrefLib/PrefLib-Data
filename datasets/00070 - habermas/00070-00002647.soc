# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I can see a need for uniform in early years, to show a sense of unity and belonging. I think it is good that they can identify and feel part of a single group. As they get older I can also see a need to allow expression and freedom of choice, to allow them to grow and not feel stifled by rules and regulations. I feel fairly neutral to the whole situation and can see the benefits in both approaches, but I feel that maybe allowing freedom of choice once in 6th form/college/university is a good way to go.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No there should be a strict uniform in place, specifically one which is affordable to all families. Allowing children to wear what they want can and does lead to bullying and social exclusion for pupils who cannot afford the popular brands.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: I think they should. Individual expression is an important part of developing creativity and a sense of identity. It also reflects the realities of the real, adult world.  Additionally, I think it would be more cost effective for parents, who otherwise have to buy overpriced uniforms every year. Some might argue that this would give students a license to dress 'inappropriately' but I think this argument reflects more on them than the students themselves, who should be free to wear what they want without judgement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, I do no think so. I feel like school is a place to learn and move forward via education. And clothing should not matter in a place like that. Uniform unifies all the students and keeps them equal. It also reduced any bullying or antisocial behavior due to wearing certain types of clothing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: Whilst some schools take uniform policies too far i do believe that students should not be free to wear whatever they want. There will always be individuals willing to push the boundaries too far for a school setting. This will either be through the use of offensive or inappropriate clothing that would negatively impact a school environment.
