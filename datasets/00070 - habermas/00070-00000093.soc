# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although cannabis is a gateway drug, we should legalise it for recreational use. This will reduce crime, and the sale of cannabis will be regulated by the government.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of legalisation, with one person being strongly against the idea. The general feeling was that legalising cannabis would help to get rid of the stigma surrounding the drug and reduce the crime rate. People with long term illnesses would also be able to avail of the drug for pain relief without the fear of prosecution. The overall feeling was that if cannabis were legalised for recreational use, it would be no worse than alcohol. The participants would also support the idea of regulating the industry to prevent potentially toxic or strong variants being sold.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should legalise cannabis for recreational use as it can help reduce crime and give the government a further source of income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Although some people see it as a 'gateway drug' I personally think alcohol makes many people act worse and rely on it more than cannabis. Mainly though I think the legalising of it would help stop drug dealers selling it which is a good thing as it stops people getting involved in those situations. People who want it are going to find a way to get it and giving a safe, monitored way of giving people it makes sense. However, if it's legalised I feel it would make the drug trade better in a sense where it isn't imported from different countries illegally. If made legal I think it would make younger people more lazy and it can also lead to mental problems as it has done with myself also if used too often. Therefore, it should only be legalised for recreational use for those who really need it such as pain relief, people with long term disabilities etc.”
