# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We don't think that people should be allowed to marry more than one person at the same time. A marriage should be between two individuals and creating more complexity for children which could be confusing. The practice of polyamory is different to polygamy, which is the practice of being married to multiple people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, we don't think that people should be allowed to marry more than one person at the same time. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, it would be confusing for any children who might be involved. It would also be difficult to decide where a family would live, and how they would organise their finances. In addition, there are a number of legal issues which would arise if this was allowed. For example, if a person was married to more than one person, and one of them died, who would inherit their estate? This would need to be decided by the courts, which could be very expensive. There is also a difference between polyamory, which is the practice of having multiple relationships, and polygamy, which is the practice of having multiple spouses. A person can have multiple relationships without being married to more than one person, whereas the term polygamy refers to being married to more than one person.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We don't think that people should be allowed to marry more than one person at the same time. There are multiple legal and ethical issues which make this an unrealistic proposition. The primary difficulty is the legal issue of breaking the trust of all your spouses by bringing more people into a marriage. On top of that it is necessary for marriages to be monogamous in order to avoid confusion and make the father legally responsible for his child, so that the child may be supported financially and emotionally by both parents. It is also important to be clear about the difference between polyamory, which is the practice of having multiple relationships, and polygamy, which is the practice of having multiple spouses. A person can have multiple relationships without being married to more than one person, whereas the term polygamy refers to being married to more than one person. Some of the moral, legal and social issues are raised in this view which makes it clear why such a practice should not be permitted. We also talk about the difference between polyamory and polygamy to clarify what the statement is referring to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We don't think that people should be allowed to marry more than one person at the same time. We think that the term polygamy is important to distinguish from polyamory, which is the practice of having multiple relationships, whereas polygamy is the practice of having multiple spouses. We believe that being married to more than one person is not practical. This would also create more complexity for children, which could be confusing. There are also a number of legal issues which would arise if this was allowed.
