# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “I think that genetically modifying animals is ok as long as it is to benefit the animal. If we are modifying an animal just for the benefit of humans then it is not acceptable.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was opposed to genetically modifying animals. The main argument presented was that animals should be left as nature intended, rather than be modified for human benefit. The group did concede that in certain situations genetic modification may be appropriate, such as to eliminate disease and increase animal lifespan.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Genetically modifying animals for human benefit is ok. If the change to the animal is for the better then its good to do.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is not ok to genetically modify animals for the sole purpose of benefiting us humans. It would not be morally acceptable to genetically modify animals for profit as this would be seen as cruel. It is however ok to genetically modify animals to eliminate disease and prevent defects in order to ensure the animal is healthy. It is ok to genetically modify animals in this way because it is ultimately in the animals best interests.
