# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Rich people should pay more tax, but it is difficult to define who is rich and who is not. There should be a system that is not reliant on an arbitrary threshold. The system should be progressive, and should ensure that the effective tax rate increases with income. The system should be fair, and should not penalise those who are just above the threshold. We also think that the current system is unfair, as there are many tax benefits that only apply to the rich. This should be changed. In addition, there are many people who are rich, but do not pay tax. This is also unfair. These people should be forced to pay tax. There should be a system to ensure that the rich pay tax, and that this tax is distributed to the poorer communities. This would help to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing taxes on the rich. The participants felt that the rich should be paying their fair share and that they could afford to pay more. The group felt that the rich were the ones benefitting the most from the current economy and should be required to support poorer communities that provide services they rely on. The group felt that the rich were able to use a lot of tax benefits where poorer people were not, and this was unfair in current society. That money should be going to other areas of the community.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the rich should pay more tax. This is because they have more money and can afford to. The rich should be contributing to society more than they currently are. The rich are also the ones benefitting most from the current economy, and they should be required to support poorer communities that provide services they rely on. The rich are able to use a lot of tax benefits where poorer people are not, and this is unfair in current society. That money should be going to other areas of the community.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of increasing taxes on the rich, however, the definition of rich was a point of contention. The group felt that there should be a more even distribution of wealth in society, and that the rich should contribute more to this. However, the group also felt that the definition of rich is important, as it is difficult to define. It was felt that the rich should be defined as those who are able to afford to pay more tax, and that those who are able to avoid paying tax should be penalised.
