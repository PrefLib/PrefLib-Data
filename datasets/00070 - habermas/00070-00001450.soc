# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, we should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison. There is much evidence to suggest that prison can have a negative effect on prisoners, with no benefit to the wider community. Increasing emphasis should be placed on community-based punishment, rehabilitation and reintegration, with a reduction in the number of prison sentences given. There may be a need to build more prisons to reduce overcrowding, however we believe this should not be done at the expense of rehabilitation and reintegration.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should be trying to reduce the number of people in prison. The focus should be on reform and rehabilitation over punishment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “Prison should be used as a last resort. It should be used to protect society from those who pose a threat to others. For those who do not pose a threat, rehabilitation should be the focus. We should also look at early intervention to prevent people from turning to crime in the first place. We should also look at alternatives to prison for non-violent offenders. This would include community service, electronic tagging and other forms of punishment.”
