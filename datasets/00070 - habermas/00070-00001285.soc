# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Horse meat is not sustainable in the UK. The health benefits of horse meat are not enough to justify eating it, and there are many other meats that are readily available and can be eaten without the need for slaughtering horses. Currently it is unnecessary in the UK to eat horse meat, as there is an abundance of other meats that can be consumed without the need for new slaughterhouses to be built and no further detriment to the environment and waste product created by the meat industry. The consensus was strongly in favour of this and we saw no evidence to contradict this argument.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Horse meat is not a sustainable option in the UK.  The health benefits of horse meat are not enough to justify eating it, and there are many other meats that are readily available and can be eaten without the need for slaughtering horses.  The horse meat industry will add to the number of animals being slaughtered for meat and will not improve the welfare of animals in the UK.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Horse meat is not a sustainable option in the UK. The health benefits of horse meat are not enough to justify eating it, and there are many other meats that are readily available and can be eaten without the need for slaughtering horses. This will result in unnecessary suffering and also risks contaminating the human food chain. The points that needed further development were: What do we mean by sustainable? How would horse meat affect the environment? How would the legalisation of horse meat affect the amount of horse meat being sold on the black market? How much horse meat is being sold on the black market?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In the United Kingdom, there is little to no justification for legalising the slaughter and consumption of horse meat.  There are already several nutritious and high-protein animal meats that are readily available on the market.  There is no strong case to support the argument that horse meat is a sustainable option in the UK, as it would be detrimental to the environment, and could cause for further unrest within the farming and livestock industry.  Legalising horse meat would only lead to more animal suffering, as the horse is very loved and cared for by many in the UK.  If further research into the consumption of horse meat was needed, this research could be done in countries which already legally consume it, and the effects would be clear.
