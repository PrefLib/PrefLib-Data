# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Most of the participants did not want the UK to rejoin the EU, because we have already left the EU and the referendum should be respected. The UK would also have to pay a large sum to rejoin the EU, and the EU is currently in a state of flux and not a particularly attractive place to be a member of. However, there was a recognition that the UK has not received the benefits of Brexit that were promised, and that the UK may have to pay a large sum to leave the EU. Therefore, it was felt that the UK should try to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU, but that the UK should not rejoin the EU.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: There was general agreement that the UK should not rejoin the EU. The main reasons for this were that the UK had already left the EU and the referendum should be respected, that the UK would have to pay a large sum to rejoin the EU, and that the EU is currently in a state of flux and not a particularly attractive place to be a member of.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the UK rejoining the EU. The main reasons for this were that the UK had already left the EU and the referendum should be respected, that the UK would have to pay a large sum to rejoin the EU, and that the EU is currently in a state of flux and not a particularly attractive place to be a member of. However, there was a recognition that the UK has not received the benefits of Brexit that were promised, and that the UK may have to pay a large sum to leave the EU. Therefore, it was felt that the UK should try to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU, but that the UK should not rejoin the EU. The group also felt that a second referendum would be divisive, and that a renegotiation of terms was more likely to succeed than an attempt to rejoin the EU.
