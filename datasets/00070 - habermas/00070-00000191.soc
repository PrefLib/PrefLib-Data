# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We have come to the conclusion that Government Surveillance Technology is a net positive for humanity. While there are people who believe the government is invading their privacy, there are many who feel safe because of the surveillance. The surveillance technology allows the government to monitor large groups of people, and through this, the government can ensure that laws are being followed. Surveillance technology has benefits that can help prevent crimes and ecological disasters. If everyone was monitored equally and the information was used only to help protect citizens, the positive effects of the surveillance would outweigh the negatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We do not believe that government surveillance is a net positive for humanity. The issue of surveillance is a highly debated topic that has polarizing opinions on both sides. We believe that surveillance technology is an infringement of personal privacy and a violation of the basic human right to privacy. With the current state of surveillance technology, there is a high chance of misuse and exploitation of private information, which can lead to financial losses and emotional distress. If the technology is used by government to protect people from acts of terrorism and crime, it is at best, an invasion of privacy. At worst, it could be used to target specific groups, or could potentially harm the lives of citizens. We believe that government surveillance technology will cause more harm than good for humanity.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Surveillance technology can be a positive for humanity if it is used to improve our lives and make the world a safer place. This was a difficult topic for participants to reach a consensus view on, as it became clear that different participants were concerned about different issues. This is because the word surveillance can mean different things to different people. Some were concerned about how the technology is used, some were concerned about how the technology was used, and others were concerned about whether the use of technology was ethical. For some, their opinions on surveillance technology was dependent on how and why the technology was being used.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Government surveillance technology can be a net positive for humanity. However, with any surveillance technology there needs to be a good balance between keeping citizens safe and ensuring their privacy is protected. The use of this technology must be done within the law, with strict regulations in place to ensure the best outcome. The issue is not so much the use of surveillance, but how it is used.
