# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The NHS should focus more on preventative medicine. However, this does not mean that it should abandon the treatment of people who are already sick. The NHS should provide a balance of preventative medicine as well as medicine for existing health needs. The preventative medicine could in some cases also treat the existing health needs that other medicines are doing now, just earlier. Instead of developing preventative medicines, the NHS should develop strategies to monitor these health needs before they get to a stage where they need medication.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The NHS should focus more on preventative medicine. However, this does not mean that it should abandon the treatment of people who are already sick. The NHS should be a balance of preventative medicine as well as medicine for existing health needs. However, preventative medicine could also treat the existing health needs that other medicines are doing now, just earlier. Rather than developing preventative medicines, the NHS could develop early intervention strategies to monitor these health needs before they get to a stage where they need medication.

The role of the NHS is not only to treat people who are ill but also to prevent people from becoming ill. Prevention is better than cure, and this is where the NHS should focus its attention. Prevention can take many forms, including a healthy lifestyle and screening programmes for at-risk individuals. Some people may feel that there is not enough evidence for preventative medicine, but this is changing. There are many examples of drugs that are preventative. Statins are a drug which reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood. They are used to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in high-risk patients. Many new treatments are being developed all the time, and a change in the way the NHS works would bring these new treatments to the people who need them the most. We believe that the NHS should focus on prevention, but must not forget the people who are already ill. The NHS should be a balance of preventative medicine as well as medicine for existing health needs. However, preventative medicine could also treat the existing health needs that other medicines are doing now, just earlier. Rather than developing prevent
