# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “I feel that we should ban the sale of plastic bags, but not the use of existing plastic bags. There's no need to sell plastic bags for shopping these days but no need to ban the use of existing plastic bags.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Plastic bags should be banned, as they have a detrimental effect on the environment and there are viable alternatives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We should ban the sale of plastic bags, but not the use of existing bags.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should ban plastic bags as they have a devastating impact on the environment. The production of plastic bags creates a lot of pollution, and they take hundreds of years to degrade. They are a major contributor to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which is the largest accumulation of plastic in the world, and they also kill many animals. We should also ban the use of plastic bags as they are unnecessary, and there are many alternatives. We should also ban plastic straws as they are also unnecessary and have a devastating impact on the environment.
