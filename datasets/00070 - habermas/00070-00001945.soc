# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: We believe that children should not be given a free computer at the age of 6. We acknowledge that there are many benefits that come from allowing children to be exposed to technology at a young age, such as increased employability. However we think that children should be given time to learn social skills by playing with other children, rather than spending time alone in front of a screen. We are also concerned about the potentially addictive qualities of computers, and consider that young children are at risk of developing these habits. Next question
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that children should not be given a free computer at the age of 6. There are a range of negative consequences associated with children spending too much time in front of a screen, as well as the likelihood that computers would not be used as an educational tool and instead be used to play games. The health effects of overexposure are also not known at this stage, as computers have not been in existence long enough for long-term effects to be seen. It is very important for children to develop important social skills through socialising with friends, rather than spending time alone in front of a computer. We acknowledge the benefits of children being exposed to technology, but believe that 6 years of age is too young to be provided with a computer. Instead, children should have access to computers at school and computers should be restricted at home.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Children should not be given a free computer at the age of 6. It is important for children to develop important social skills through socialising with friends, rather than spending time alone in front of a computer. Children are also not exposed to technology enough through other means, such as at school, so having access to a computer at such a young age is not necessary.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Children should not be given a free computer at the age of 6, as it is too young for children to be introduced to the risks associated with technology. There is strong evidence to suggest that too much screen time at a young age can impact on children’s ability to develop important social skills, as well as be addictive and harmful for their eyes. While it is important that children are exposed to technology, it is likely that children would not use a free computer as an educational tool, but would instead use it to play games. It is very important for children to develop important social skills through socialising with friends, rather than spending time alone in front of a computer. We acknowledge the benefits of children being exposed to technology, but believe that 6 years of age is too young to be provided with a computer.
