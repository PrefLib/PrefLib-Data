# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the legalisation of cannabis would be a good thing as it would allow for proper regulation, research and access to the drug for medical use. However, it is important to remember that there are people who may abuse the drug and there needs to be proper education to ensure that this does not happen. It is also important to remember that the legalisation of cannabis does not mean that it will be widely available to children and young people. The opinions of the group have been changed by hearing the views of others and by coming to a consensus. In this way, the opinions of the group are different to the opinions of the individuals that make it up.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Cannabis is widely used in the UK and has no proven negative effects. Thus it makes sense that people can buy this in a safe and controlled way. By doing this taxes would be levied and money kept out of the pockets of organised criminal groups. The added boon would be allowing access to sufferers of a number of medical conditions that cannabis is known to treat but is not prescribed for.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the sale of cannabis should be legalised in the UK. It would allow for proper regulation and safety of the drug. It would also end the expensive and discriminatory enforcement of laws against the drug. It seems very easy for people to obtain the drug illegally, so it makes sense to stop the illegal dealing. This would reduce crime and make the industry safer. It would also provide better medical access for patients suffering with a multitude of chronic pain conditions, cancer, PTSD, MS etc. It would also reduce the criminalisation of vulnerable people, reducing the number of arrests and time spent in prison for low level offences. It would create jobs and allow for proper regulation and research.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “After much deliberation, the group has come to the consensus view that the sale of cannabis should be allowed in the UK. We feel that this would reduce the number of people coming into contact with organised criminal groups, and would also provide a source of revenue for the government in the form of taxation. This would also mean that people suffering from chronic pain conditions, cancer, PTSD, MS etc. would have better access to cannabis for medical purposes. It would also reduce the criminalisation of vulnerable people, reducing the number of arrests and time spent in prison for low level offences. It would create jobs and allow for proper regulation and research. Alcohol is far more harmful and causes more deaths and chronic health conditions than cannabis, and alcohol is currently legal in the UK. It could also reduce the amount of people coming into contact with drug dealers and criminals who have access to more harmful drugs. We feel that the sale of cannabis would be a positive step for the UK.”
