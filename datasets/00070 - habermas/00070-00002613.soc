# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: yes there should be the opinion representation in management and boards to handle the the illegal activities
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Yes there should be a union representation in management and boards. This would help to represent and defend the interests and needs of all employees. It is important that everybody is represented and not just a select number of people. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There should be union representation in management and boards. Union representation ensures that worker views and concerns are correctly represented in the highest levels of an organisation. Currently, there is no Union representation and that creates issues and difficulties later on when factors like pay, working conditions, retirement benefits etc are set for each year.  I am strongly of the opinion that there should be union representation to ensure a fair, just and equitable management of both employees and employers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I believe when working for anyone, you should be involved with a union who can advocate for you and guide you through your employment to ensure that everything that happens within said job, is all above board. the industrial revolution and the creation of unions should never be forgotten - it is our history that unites us and if we fail to remember why representation and safe employment is necessary, what is the point in any of us working? that would be deliberately lining the pockets of the heirarchy within your job, without yourself or your colleagues being represented. management should have unions, however they should also be subject to assessments that ensures no one is abusing their position of power.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I believe that there should definately be union representation within management and boards. This way ensuring that company practices are conducted within the law and encourage fairness to employees from the top of the company. Although some may see it as a conflict of interests i'd say it was needed to make sure the fair treatment of employees within the workplace while not focusing on pure profit for company top tier employees.
