# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We agree that the government should make it easier for people to switch to other energy suppliers. The current system is very complicated and people find it difficult to switch. If it was easier, it would be beneficial for both customers and energy suppliers. Customers would be able to find the best deals for them and energy suppliers would have to keep their prices competitive to attract new customers. This would be fairer for customers and would create an environment where suppliers have to keep their prices competitively low, rather than being able to hike up costs knowing that their customers cannot easily switch to an alternative supplier.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the government should make it easier for people to switch to other energy suppliers. The current system is very complicated and many people find it difficult to change energy suppliers. It may sometimes seem difficult, but it is actually quite easy to switch. If it was easier, it would be beneficial for both customers and energy suppliers. Customers would be able to find the best deals for them and energy suppliers would have to keep their prices competitive to attract new customers. This would be fairer for customers and would create an environment where suppliers have to keep their prices competitively low, rather than being able to hike up costs knowing that their customers cannot easily switch to an alternative supplier.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We believe that the government should make it easier for people to switch to other energy suppliers. The current system is very complicated and people find it difficult to switch. If it was easier, it would be beneficial for both customers and energy suppliers. Customers would be able to find the best deals for them and energy suppliers would have to keep their prices competitive to attract new customers. This would be fairer for customers and would create an environment where suppliers have to keep their prices competitively low, rather than being able to hike up costs knowing that their customers cannot easily switch to an alternative supplier. This would also be beneficial for people who work long, unsociable hours and may not be able to contact their supplier during the day or the elderly who may not be able to easily change energy supplier online.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that the government should make it easier for people to switch to other energy suppliers.
