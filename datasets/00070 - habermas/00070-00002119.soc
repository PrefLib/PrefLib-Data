# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People who choose to become vegans should not be allowed to sue people who force them to eat animal products.  This is because the people who force them to eat animal products are not aware of their dietary choices.  However, the people who force them to eat animal products should be made aware of their dietary choices and the reasons behind them.  The people who force them to eat animal products should also be made aware of the consequences of their actions and how they could affect the person who has chosen to become a vegan.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People who choose to become vegans should be allowed to sue people who force them to eat animal products, if it can be shown that it was not accidental.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - People who choose to become vegans should not be allowed to sue people who force them to eat animal products.  This is because vegans who choose to eat at a restaurant that is not exclusively vegan must take responsibility for what they order.  It is not the responsibility of the restaurant to know the dietary requirements of their customers.  It is also difficult to prove that a vegan has been forced to eat animal products.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Veganism is an important life choice and often a deeply held belief. Therefore if a vegan is served meat or animal products in a restaurant, and they have explained that they are vegan and do not wish to eat meat, they should be able to sue the restaurant. Especially if they have asked beforehand about what they can eat and been assured by the restaurant staff that there will be no meat or animal products in their food.  If the individual is unsure about whether or not their food has been prepared in a vegan way, they should definitely be able to sue. However if the individual has not specifically stated that they are vegan and do not want to eat meat or animal products, they should not be able to sue, as the restaurant is not at fault for not being aware of the individuals food preferences.  If an individual is served meat accidentally, but is not a vegan, they should not be able to sue. This is because they have not made their food preferences clear and therefore the restaurant is not at fault.
