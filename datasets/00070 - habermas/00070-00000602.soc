# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of selling off some land owned by the royal family. The consensus was that the royal family has more land than it needs, and that it could be put to good use to solve some of the housing crisis in the UK. It was agreed that the royal family should keep the important historical landmarks, but that other land could be sold.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of selling some of the royal family's land. This was mainly because they thought that the money gained from selling the land could be used to improve the lives of ordinary people in the UK. The group also thought that the land could be used for housing, which would help the UK's housing shortage.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that some of the land owned by the royal family should be sold off. We believe this because there is a shortage of land in the UK and it could be used for more important things such as housing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: We should allow some of the land owned by the royal family to be sold off, but only in areas where it will not impact on the beauty of the landscape. This is because we need to preserve the landscape as it is an important part of our heritage and it will also help to attract tourists. The money from the sale of the land could be used to help alleviate the housing shortage and other social issues.
