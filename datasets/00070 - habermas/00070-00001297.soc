# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a referendum on Scottish independence. However, a referendum alone is not sufficient to settle this matter. A referendum should be used to determine the general view of the Scottish people, and also to raise the profile of the issue. After a referendum, there should be a careful consideration of the issue, taking into account both sides of the debate, before a final decision is made. This decision should not be taken by politicians alone, but should also involve experts from many areas, including business, the economy, immigration and others.  This decision should not only consider the Scottish people, but also the rest of the UK. A Scottish referendum must not be taken in isolation, but must be considered within the context of the whole of the UK, in addition to the European Union. The group's consensus opinion is that there should be a Scottish referendum, but that it should not be used to come to a final decision.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: We believe there should be a Scottish Independence referendum. However, a referendum alone is not sufficient to settle this matter. A referendum can never be as representative of the whole population as we would hope. A referendum should be used to determine the general view of the Scottish people, and also to raise the profile of the issue. After a referendum, there should be a careful consideration of the issue, taking into account both sides of the debate, before a final decision is made. This decision should not be taken by politicians alone, but should also involve experts from many areas, including business, the economy, immigration and others.  This decision should not only consider the Scottish people, but also the rest of the UK. A Scottish referendum must not be taken in isolation, but must be considered within the context of the whole of the UK, in addition to the European Union. It is important to note that Northern Ireland would also need to consider the relationship that they would seek with a newly independent Scotland.
