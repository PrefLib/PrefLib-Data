# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of allowing both men and women to serve in the military. Some participants were in favour of allowing both sexes to serve in all roles, including combat roles, while others were in favour of allowing both sexes to serve in all roles except combat roles. The group agreed that there is a difference in physicality between the sexes, but that with the right training and hard work, women can perform just as well as men in most roles. The group also agreed that combat roles are a challenging area and that men are usually better suited to combat both in terms of strength and the potential for sexual violence if captured. The group agreed that we have to balance interests of equality of opportunity versus the practicalities of combat roles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that men and women should both be allowed to serve in the military. There are a range of views that suggest that women are not as strong, or capable as men, however this is based on a number of different arguments and is an issue that has been debated for a number of years. There are no reasons why women should be excluded from the military, and in fact there are many reasons why they should be allowed. They have a variety of different skills, which can contribute to a wider variety of roles in the military. For the most part, they can do the same roles as men and, despite any physical differences, this does not impact on their ability to perform as well as men. There is also an element of equality. Allowing women to serve in the military means that they are given the same opportunities as men, to serve their country. Allowing women to serve also means that women can enjoy the same benefits that men get for serving in the military. There are some differences between men and women, however we should not let this stop women from serving.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Women should be allowed to serve in the military, however not in combat roles. This is to protect them from the potential for sexual violence if captured. Women should be allowed to serve in non-combat roles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes. It is unfair that both sexes should be able to be drafted, but only one sex be allowed to serve. However, there is a realistic difference in physical ability and this must be taken into account in regards to front line combat.
