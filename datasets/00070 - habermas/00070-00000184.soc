# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should be putting more money into the NHS. The NHS is a very important part of the UK and is currently underfunded. We should not take this important service for granted and ensure it receives more money, so that it can continue to provide a high standard of healthcare for the people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, we should put more money into the National Health Service. The NHS is a core part of our country and thus the money needed to run it should be provided, not only because of the services it provides but also the jobs it offers and the stability it gives to our economy. It is a necessity to the country. It provides all the healthcare needs for a large number of people in our country, from cancer treatment to maternity care and organ transplants. It also helps with a number of problems that affect people mentally, such as depression and anxiety. We also shouldn't forget that the NHS isn't just doctors and nurses, but also cleaners, radiographers, dieticians, health care assistants and so many more who play a key role in the NHS. A large amount of the NHS's budget is spent on staff. There is a shortage of doctors and nurses which means that the NHS has to pay extra to get staff from abroad to work for them, which is expensive. More money would allow them to employ more staff so there would be more appointments and less waiting time for patients, as well as more staff to take care of them. Money would also allow the NHS to get more specialist equipment which is
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The NHS is a core part of the country and thus the money needed to run it should be provided, but not without question. There is a need for more doctors, nurses, health practitioners and they all need the training and salary to reflect their skills and knowledge. There is also a backlog of surgery/operations as shown in the news which could be helped by increasing the money the NHS receives. The money could be used to update their technology and specialist equipment which will help patients, and help staff work more more efficiently.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The NHS is the best health service in the world, and that is because of the fantastic doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers who are working tirelessly to keep us healthy. As such, they need more resources, training, and equipment to do so, which can only be funded by the government. We don't realise how much we take the NHS for granted until we need it, and then we don't complain about the cost of it. We as a country should be proud of the NHS, and should be willing to pay more money for it so that it can continue to be the best healthcare service in the world.”
