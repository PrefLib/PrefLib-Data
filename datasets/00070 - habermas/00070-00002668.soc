# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, incarceration should not be seen as a punishment but as a way to bring the criminals back to the society as a fully functional members. Norway's prison system is renowned as one of the most effective and humane in the world. However, if the person is a danger to the society, he should be removed from the society and this is when prison becomes an option. In this case, prisons should be built to accommodate all prisoners. The prison population should be reduced by using alternative punishments to prison, such as community service, for those who are not a danger to the society. In addition, prisons should be more humane and should not be seen as a punishment. The experience of being in prison should be unpleasant, but not to the extent of causing further damage to the prisoner. The prisoner should be rehabilitated and the aim should be to bring them back to the society as a fully functional member.

The experience of being in prison should be unpleasant, but not to the extent of causing further damage to the prisoner.

There should be more research done on prison effectiveness as there is a need for high quality evidence on what the costs and benefits of imprisonment are compared with other methods of preventing crime. Moreover, we should be looking at countries with a more effective prison system and learning from them in order to build our own prison system more effectively and humanly.
