# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of subsidising more jobs in the construction industry. The group felt that the construction industry is a profitable industry and that the government should not be subsidising jobs in this industry. The group felt that the government money would be better spent in other areas such as health, education and training.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the government subsidising more jobs in the construction industry. The group felt that the construction industry is already a very profitable industry and that the government should not be subsidising an industry that is already very successful. The group felt that the government should be spending money on helping people and training in less successful parts of the economy. The group felt that education in general would be a better place for government money to be spent.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to the idea of the government subsidising more jobs in the construction industry. The group felt that the construction industry was already a very profitable industry and there were better ways for the government to spend their money. The group felt that the government should spend their money on helping people in less successful parts of the economy, and on education in general.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We have come to the decision that the government should subsidise more jobs in the construction industry. We feel that this is an industry that would benefit greatly from government funding. The construction industry is one of the biggest industries in the UK and employs a large number of people. If the government were to subsidise more jobs in the construction industry, more people would be employed and this would be good for the economy. If more people were employed in the construction industry, this would lead to an increase in the amount of houses being built. There is a large shortage of houses in the UK and we feel that this is something that needs to be addressed. We feel that the government should subsidise more jobs in the construction industry and that this would be beneficial for the economy and for the people of the UK.
