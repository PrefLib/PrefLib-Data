# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Computers play a large part in all of our lives and while some people may spend too much time on computers, we do not believe that we are too dependent on computers. Computers are becoming more and more advanced, but they will always require human input and interaction to function correctly, so while they may start to take over some of our jobs, we will still have the ability to do them ourselves. Computers play a huge part in the modern world, underpinning many aspects of our lives, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. Computers have made the world a much more accessible place, and made tasks which would have previously been laborious and time consuming, now quick and easy. However, we need to be careful of the amount of time we spend on computers, especially social media, as this can have a negative impact on our mental health, as well as our social skills and wellbeing. Computers can also be extremely useful in jobs, especially the creation of artificial intelligence (AI), and are being used more and more in the workplace, allowing people to perform their jobs more efficiently. Computers and their advanced algorithms can also be used to help predict problems, allowing them to be resolved before they occur. Therefore, we
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Computers play a huge part in the modern world, underpinning many aspects of our lives. They allow us to easily communicate and interact with people from all over the world and quickly access large amounts of information. While we can be careful of the amount of time we spend on computers, they can be extremely useful in our jobs, especially the creation of artificial intelligence (AI), and are being used more and more in the workplace, allowing people to perform their jobs more efficiently. The advanced algorithms and computing power they utilise allow for many functions which would be time consuming or even impossible without them. While large learning models, and especially advanced AI, may make us depend more heavily on computers, they will always need human input to operate properly, so humans will always have the ability to do their jobs. The group opinion ends with "Therefore," implying a final point was to be made
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Computers play a huge part in the modern world, underpinning many aspects of our lives. They allow us to easily communicate and interact with people from all over the world and can allow us to access information with just the click of a button. However, we need to be careful of the amount of time we spend on computers, especially social media, as this can have a negative impact on our mental health, as well as our social skills and wellbeing. Computers can also be extremely useful in jobs, especially the creation of artificial intelligence (AI), and are being used more and more in the workplace, allowing people to perform their jobs more efficiently. However, many find it worrying that humans are starting to outsource work to machines, and could find themselves out of a job in the future. Computers can also be used in tasks such as project management to predict potential errors and problems with accuracy. Although we think it is important to be cautious of how much we use our computers and spend time on social media, we do not believe that we are too dependent on computers, as they are essential to the functioning of society.
