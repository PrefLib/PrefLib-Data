# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We should remove statues of racist historical figures from public places. This should be done immediately. There should never have been such statues erected in the first place and the fact that they are still in place is atrocious. Some people affected by these figures have to walk past them on a daily basis and feel the pain of their ancestors. The removal of such statues will send an important message that the actions, beliefs and crimes committed by these individuals are abhorrent and intolerable. There is also an argument that the removal of these statues will not erase history and it is important that the people who suffered at their hands are remembered and we need to recognise what happened as they are the facts of human history whether we like it or not.

However, it is important to remember that the erection of such statues was a product of its time and was not considered to be controversial at the time. It is important to understand the context in which these statues were erected in order to fully appreciate why they are being removed.
