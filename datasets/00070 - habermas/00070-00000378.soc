# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government is failing to tackle child obesity. They need to stop looking at ways to increase revenue and start looking at the future of the nation. There are simple steps the government can take to start tackling the issue. Firstly, it needs to make school meals healthy and compulsory. This would ensure that children at least get one healthy meal a day. Secondly, it needs to find a way to subsidise healthy foods and make it easier for parents to provide healthy meals at home. Finally, the government needs to invest in programmes that educate kids about healthy eating and physical exercise, and make this part of the school curriculum.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: The government is failing to tackle child obesity. They make a lot of statements on how they will tackle the issue, but they never back up their statements with any real measures that will make a difference. Taking into consideration the high obesity rates among kids and the long term costs to the NHS, the government should be tackling this issue more actively and effectively than they are now.  Conclusion:  The survey carried out was able to determine the level of public awareness of the issue of child obesity. The survey also assessed the public's attitude towards the subject and their opinions on the government's role in tackling the issue. Based on the results, the research concludes that there is a high level of public awareness on the issue of child obesity, with a large proportion of the sample population rating the issue as very important. The research concludes that there is also a large level of public support for tackling the issue of child obesity. Based on the results, the research concludes that there is an almost even divide between the participants who believe that the government is not doing enough to tackle child obesity and the participants who think the government is doing enough. The research concludes that based on the results, the government is failing to adequately tackle child obesity
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government is failing to tackle the problem of child obesity, and although it has introduced some measures, they are not as far reaching as they need to be.  It is only taking baby steps and the impact is not being felt by the nation. The government is in danger of taking the issue too lightly, and should consider implementing some more robust policies such as a universal school meal scheme for all pupils at all schools, not just for primary school pupils.  This would also help with tackling the problem of childhood hunger and malnutrition.  The government should also be considering making it mandatory for employers to provide healthy meals at work.  This will lead to a reduction in employees eating out at fast food outlets, and instead will be encouraged to make healthier choices, as they will be provided with healthier foods at work.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: The government is failing to tackle child obesity, by not taking enough decisive action. The issue of child obesity is so serious that the government must take responsibility and impose measures on the food industry to stop pushing unhealthy food, especially on kids. They need to get the kids exercising at school and stop the unhealthy foods from being sold at school. This will also save the country money long term in medical costs.
