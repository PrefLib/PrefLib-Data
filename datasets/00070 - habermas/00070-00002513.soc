# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, plastic waste is a blight on the planet. There are many other options out there instead of plastic bottles, so there really is no need to buy them. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Absolutely. There is no need for these items, there are many alternatives for people to use e.g. reusable bottles. Plastic is a blight in our oceans, in hedgerows, littering streets and ending up in landfill or having to be expensively recycled.  The plastic itself is also injurious to people as chemicals and toxins leech from the plastic into the products it contains.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - They should be phased out and eventually soon banned. Plastics are causing so many problems with manufacture emissions, pollution and permenant waste, Even though they some are now being made from recycled materials they still are extremely difficult to permenantly remove as waste when the time comes. Surely science can come up with a more eco friendly totally biodegradable sollution in this day and age.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes there should definitely be a ban on small plastic water bottles. They are too disposable. In this day and age there is no reason for anyone not to one a reusable bottle. There are aesthetically pleasing, well built alternatives to plastic water bottles. Those using disposable water bottles are purely lazy.
