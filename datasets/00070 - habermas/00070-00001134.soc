# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: While the freedom of speech is an important right, we believe that it is more important to protect vulnerable people from harmful ideas. There is a difference between respecting and encouraging different ideas and being hateful and discriminatory towards people. We believe that freedom of speech is important but so is the protection of vulnerable people and it is only when the two can be reconciled, that we will achieve a healthy and happy society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: While the freedom of speech is an important right, we believe that it is more important to protect vulnerable people from harmful ideas. There is a difference between respecting and encouraging different ideas and being hateful and discriminatory towards people. We believe that freedom of speech is important but so is the protection of vulnerable people and it is only when the two can be reconciled, that we will achieve a healthy and happy society. We believe that the freedom of speech is a right that should be defended as a core human right. We agree that there needs to be limitations on freedom of speech to prevent hate speech from happening and to stop it from being normalized. We believe that it is possible to strike a balance between freedom of speech and the protection of vulnerable people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Final consensus statement: Freedom of speech is an important right but it is even more important that vulnerable people are protected from harmful ideas. We believe that there is a difference between respecting different ideas and being hateful or discriminatory towards people and the only way to protect vulnerable people is to limit freedom of speech. It is only when both freedom of speech and protection of vulnerable people can be reconciled, that we can have a healthy and happy society.
