# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a maximum and minimum wage. A maximum wage is hard to put into practice and would have to be on an individual basis as people are not on the same level of productivity and therefore will not make the same amount of money. The minimum wage is in place to protect workers from being exploited for little pay. This should be enforced for workers in big companies, such as the CEO of Facebook, as it would help with wage equality and decrease the huge gap between the highest and lowest paid.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the minimum wage is something that is in place to protect workers from being exploited for little pay. A maximum wage would be rather hard to put into practice as this would have to be on an individual basis as people are not on the same level of productivity and therefore will not make the same amount of money. However, I think it would be good to have a maximum and minimum wage for big company CEOs, such as the CEO of Facebook. This would also help with wage equality, as currently there is a huge gap between the highest and lowest paid in the country.

Conclusion This was a useful exercise, particularly as the consensus view of the group was not so different to my own. The consensus view was that there should be a minimum wage to protect workers from being exploited. A maximum wage is hard to enforce because it would have to be on an individual basis. However, a maximum wage for big company CEOs would be useful to increase wage equality. In general, I agree with the consensus view. I believe that a minimum wage is important to ensure workers are not exploited. I am not sure how a maximum wage would be set for individuals. Perhaps a more generic maximum and minimum would be possible to set,

This would also help with wage equality, as currently there is a huge gap between the highest and lowest paid in the country. Conclusion There is a big difference in pay in the UK. As of 2018, the average salary of a company CEO is £5.5 million, while the minimum wage is set at £7.83 per hour, or £15,080 per year. So there is a huge gap between the highest and lowest paid in the country. However, the group of participants feel that it would be a good idea to set a maximum and minimum wage for big company CEOs. This would help with wage equality and close the gap between the highest and lowest paid in the country.
