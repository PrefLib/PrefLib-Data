# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “People have the right to personal choice when it comes to eating. We must protect our children from advertising unhealthy foods, but we should not limit this right for adults. It would be difficult to regulate and we don’t want to be a ‘nanny state’. Advertising to children is the only area that we feel the Government should get involved in. They should invest in advertising campaigns to encourage people to eat healthily, but they should not spend tax payers money on adverts which promote any particular product.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “Unhealthy food is everywhere, but it is not always advertised. It would be difficult to regulate and we don’t want to be a ‘nanny state’. We are in favour of people having choice, but we should protect our children from advertisements which are designed to make unhealthy food attractive. The only way to protect children is to ban advertising on children’s TV and perhaps in children’s magazines. We do not believe that advertising to adults should be banned, as people are able to make up their own minds about what is healthy and what is not. We feel that the Government should invest in advertising campaigns to encourage people to eat healthily, but we feel that these would be more effective if they used famous athletes and celebrities to promote the idea of healthy eating. However, we believe that the Government should not spend tax payers money on adverts which promote any particular product.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “Unhealthy food is everywhere, but it is not always advertised. It would be difficult to regulate and we don’t want to be a ‘nanny state’. We are in favour of people having choice, but we should protect our children from advertisements which are designed to make unhealthy food attractive.

However, we believe that the Government should not spend tax payers money on adverts which promote any particular product.”  A group of participants was tasked with coming up with a consensus opinion on an important question. Participants first expressed their personal opinions on the question. Then, a first draft of a consensus statement was produced. Participants then provided a critique of the draft consensus statement. Finally, a final consensus statement was produced. Below is presented
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - “The advertising of unhealthy food is everywhere, but it is not always advertised. Advertising is a vague and nebulous term and is hard to regulate. We are in favour of people having choice, but we should take some action to protect impressionable children. The only way to protect children is to ban advertising on children’s TV and perhaps in children’s magazines. We do not believe that advertising to adults should be banned, as people are able to make up their own minds about what is healthy and what is not. We feel that the Government should invest in advertising campaigns to encourage people to eat healthily, but we feel that these would be more effective if they used famous athletes and celebrities to promote the idea of healthy eating. However, we believe that the Government should not spend tax payers money on adverts which promote any particular product.”
