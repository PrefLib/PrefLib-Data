# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that public transport should be free for children, the elderly, and those on the lowest incomes in the UK. Public transport will reduce carbon emissions, it will allow people on lower incomes to travel further afield, it will encourage people to get to know more about the country and reduce isolation for the elderly. We believe that people on the lowest incomes will benefit most from this, because they will be able to get to work more easily, they will be able to visit friends and family, and they will be able to socialise without the added pressure of having to find the money for travel costs. We feel that in a democracy, all citizens should have a say in how the country is run, and the elderly and those on lower incomes will be more encouraged to have a say in the running of the country if they have a means to travel to places where they are more likely to have a say in what is happening in their communities. The state should be encouraged to provide free public transport to the elderly, to children, and to those on the lowest incomes.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of free public transport. The group believed that it would reduce congestion and pollution, and would also reduce the number of cars on the road. The group believed that it would also help the elderly and those on low incomes to get out and about. The group also believed that it would help to reduce the number of people driving to work, and would therefore reduce the number of cars on the road during rush hour.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes, the state should provide free public transport for certain groups.
