# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Consensus statement from group of participants:  It is highly likely that humans will gain the ability to communicate with animals, given that research and advances in AI and machine learning continue to progress at a rapid rate. Current research also indicates that humans will be able to understand animal communications in a similar way to how we can currently interpret body language. Moreover, the significant advances in AI will aid the development of brain-computer interfaces which can help humans and animals to communicate. Initially, such systems will help to interpret and decode animal sign language and noises, but in the long term, human can learn to speak the language of animals as we know from existing dolphin/whale communication systems. It is certain that we will be able to more fully understand animal communications but we may not understand their language as they would not have the cognitive ability to learn ours. The most likely first targets of this research will be animals with a high level of intelligence, such as dolphins, whales and octopuses.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Final consensus statement: It is highly likely that humans will gain the ability to communicate with animals, given that research and advances in AI and machine learning continue to progress at a rapid rate. Humans are likely to be able to understand animal communications in a similar way to how we can currently interpret body language.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Humans will learn to communicate with animals, but not in the near future. In the next 10-20 years, humans will learn how to communicate with animals in the same way we can currently interpret body language. Communication between humans and animals will be two way, but animals will not be able to learn our language due to their limited cognitive ability. In the next 10-20 years, humans will learn to communicate with the most intelligent animals, such as dolphins, whales, octopuses, and chimpanzees.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is highly likely that humans will gain the ability to communicate with animals, given that research and advances in AI and machine learning continue to progress at a rapid rate. We will be able to communicate more fully with animals but we may not understand their language as they would not have the cognitive ability to learn ours. However, humans will be able to understand animal communications in a similar way to how we can currently interpret body language. Humans will learn to communicate with animals that have a high level of intelligence. In the near future, it is likely that this will be dolphins, whales and octopuses. This is because these animals have a high level of intelligence, which means they will be able to learn some of the ways in which humans communicate, and also because they are aquatic animals, which means that the technology used to understand them will need to be waterproof.
