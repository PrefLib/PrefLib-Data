# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: “While the focus of the NHS should be on curing patients with illnesses, there is a strong need for the NHS to focus more on prevention.  We believe that more money should be invested into prevention measures, and this will pay off in the long run.  The first step is to promote the message that prevention is more important than cure.  The next step is to take action, which includes funding campaigns to educate the public about health, including healthy eating and anti-smoking campaigns.  It will also include funding to prevent the transmission of diseases and epidemics.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Prevention is always better than cure, but both are needed in the NHS.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Prevention is better than cure, but the government needs to do more to support this.   The government should invest more in preventative measures.   This will not only help the NHS in the long term but will also help the economy as a whole.   The government needs to make healthy food more accessible and affordable.   They also need to invest more in preventative measures for mental health problems.    This will help people in the long term.    The government also needs to invest more in research for cures.   This will help people who are already ill and will also help the economy in the long term.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is better to focus on prevention over cure, as it can save the government money and is easier than trying to cure the illness.
