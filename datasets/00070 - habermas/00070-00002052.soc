# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: - Underage drinking is a major issue in the UK.  Young people who have never experienced drinking alcohol are susceptible to consuming large amounts of alcohol which can cause them to become very intoxicated, which is dangerous to the individual and others around them. - Drinking a lot of alcohol has also been proven to cause several illnesses such as cancer, high blood pressure, and diabetes. - Moreover we want to ensure that fewer young people start drinking from the legal age of 18 by restricting the accessibility of alcohol. - By restricting the sale of alcohol there is less pressure on people to drink which makes people more able to say no, or drink a smaller quantity, as a social occasion is not defined by the alcohol consumption. - To conclude, if the sale of alcohol was restricted in pubs and clubs there would be less road traffic accidents, more people would be drinking in a safe environment with others, and this would mean that, in the opinion of this group, the general health of the UK would be improved.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The sale of alcohol should be restricted because of the health and safety concerns, particularly the dangers of underage drinking and the problems with driving under the influence of alcohol.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Consensus View: In the opinion of the group the sale of alcohol should be restricted for the following reasons: - Underage drinking is a major issue in the UK.  Young people who have never experienced drinking alcohol are susceptible to consuming a large amount of alcohol.  This causes them to become very intoxicated, which is dangerous to the individual and those around them. - Drinking a lot of alcohol has also been proven to cause several illnesses such as cancer, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Also, if the sale of alcohol was restricted in pubs and clubs it would mean there is less pressure on people to drink.  They would also not feel so isolated when they do not want to drink. - In addition, limiting alcohol sales would also reduce the likelihood of drink driving.  It has been proven that a lot of accidents on the road have been caused by people driving under the influence of alcohol.
