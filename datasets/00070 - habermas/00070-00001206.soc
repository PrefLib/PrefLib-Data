# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government should require people to do jury service to ensure a broad representation of people can sit on the jury. This allows the justice system to run smoothly as jury members are impartial and can make a fair and unbiased decision on the case they are sitting on. The jury must make the correct verdict and must not be influenced by a judge or anyone else. However, some people may not want to do jury service as it could have a big impact on their lives, for example, people who are the main carer for someone or someone who is a single parent may not want to take the time out of their lives to do jury service. It is also important that jurors do not discuss their case with anyone else so this could mean that the juror would have to take a significant amount of time off from their job or even quit their job. The government should make it so that people who don't want to do jury service, don't have to, but must have a good excuse for not wanting to. In conclusion, the government should require people to do jury service to ensure the justice system runs smoothly and all jury members are impartial and unbiased.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Final consensus statement: Jury service allows people to take part in running the justice system and gives all people an equal chance to serve on a jury. This is important as a jury is impartial, and are not biased by any judge or the police so they can make a fair and unbiased decision on the case they are sitting on. This ensures fairness in a legal system. However, some people may find jury service challenging because they may have care responsibilities such as looking after a young child, someone elderly or someone who has a disability. Although it is possible to postpone jury service, this would mean it could be several months before it is rescheduled, making jury service difficult for these people. Therefore it is important that people are understanding and take into account these circumstances so that jury service remains as fair and as unbiased as possible.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It was thought by the group that the government should require people to do jury service to allow for a broad representation of people to sit on the jury. However, the government must realise that sometimes people may find it hard to carry out their jury service due to personal circumstances and that exemptions should be considered. Also, the government must take into account the fact that sometimes it is necessary for jury members to take time off work and that this can have an impact on their job or finances. The main reason that the government should require people to do jury service is to ensure that people who are not employed by the government, who are not biased, can make decisions on cases e.g. murder cases. Jury members must be able to carry out their job effectively and make the correct decision and that they are not influenced by others.
