# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Public transport should not be free in London. It is already subsidised by the taxpayer and free public transport would only serve to increase congestion and pollution in the capital. The congestion charge is already in place to reduce congestion and pollution in London.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the conclusion that public transport in London should be free for the under 16's and for people over the age of 65. We feel that the younger generation should be encouraged to use public transport as this will be beneficial to them in the future. We also feel that people over the age of 65 should not have to pay for public transport as many people of this age are on a fixed income and the cost of living in London is very high. The cost of public transport is a big expense for many people. By making it free for these age groups, it will help them to save money. Public transport is an essential part of life in London. It is very important to encourage people to use public transport and not their cars. This will help to reduce congestion and pollution in London.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - We don't feel that there should be free public transport in London. However, the cost of public transport is very expensive and this is something that needs to be addressed. We feel that the cost of public transport in London should be reduced and this will help to reduce congestion and pollution in the city.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, public transport should not be free in London.  Whilst the idea of it may sound good, it will have to be paid for somehow which will probably mean an increase in taxation.  This would be unfair as many people who live in London will not use public transport.  Many people who live outside of London would also have to pay for this as they would be taxed too, but would not use public transport.  The congestion charge already encourages people to use public transport and this is a good way to reduce congestion.
