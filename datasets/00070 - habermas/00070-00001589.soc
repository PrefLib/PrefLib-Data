# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Final consensus statement: We believe that humans should go into space. The reasons for this is that it is not worth the risks to send animals and while it is dangerous to send humans, we are willing to take the risks for the greater good of space exploration and scientific research. Ultimately, if we wish to know more about space, the only solution is for humans to be sent into space. Words: 690
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We believe that we should send humans into space. The reasons for this is that humans are the most advanced of the animals on earth and as such, are the most able to explore and investigate space and space exploration. While it is undeniable that it is an expensive and dangerous endeavor, there are many benefits that come from sending humans into space. It is often very necessary in exploration, as animals cannot consent to being in space, humans can and as such, it is much more ethical to send humans into space than animals. Furthermore, it is very important for scientific research and furthering our understanding of space. It allows us to better understand the planet we are on, as well as other planets. Benefits of MSCS: The benefits of using MSCS in future are many.  First of all, it helps the researcher to better understand the views of the participants.  While any researcher can see the opinions that are presented by participants, what is crucial is the understanding of why they believe that.  This helps the researcher make sense of the views of the participants, and understand what may have caused the participants to believe or be influenced by something.
