# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No, they should not be banned, although they must be regulated to prevent tragedies. Fireworks with a certain amount of flame able material should be banned as this can cause serious accidents. The should only be used in open spaces and if a larger amount is to be used law must ensure that adequate safety measures are taken before hand. Also Fireworks must only be sold and handled by adults depending on the size of the explosion professionals must also be involved.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Fireworks provide a beautiful display for 5th November, and are also used in many other cultures, such as for Chinese New Year, and for Asian weddings. They do, however, cause air pollution, and have caused accidents. I think that they should at least be limited to organised events, such as public displays, not just people using them at home, but with the advances in light displays, maybe they won't been needed in the future, and we can have a similar effect with something that is both safer and less damaging to the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Fireworks should be banned because they cause a lot of injuries, disturb people with loud noises and are expensive. Also there is a risk of fire in the factory producing them and the risk that they are stolen. Fireworks contribute to global warning as they burn and they also contain chemicals which then pollute the atmosphere. Children can get hold of them unless they are banned. There should be other more eco friendly options like laser lights and virtual reality. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I don't really have a strong opinion on the matter, I don't really enjoy fireworks, but that isn't reason enough to stop other people from enjoying them. The only arguments against them I can think of is that they might be harmful towards people with PTSD from being in the military
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: No, although there are some points that should be considered, such as frightening pets and causing harm if used incorrectly. However, some of my favourite moments have been the social aspect of bonfire night and new year firework display. Creating awareness campaigns around safe usage should be the way forward.
