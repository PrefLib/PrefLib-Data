# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the use of DNA evidence to identify a person as a criminal is acceptable. DNA evidence can be used to identify a person as a criminal in a wide variety of cases. DNA evidence is often used to solve crimes that would have otherwise gone unsolved. The use of DNA evidence has helped to convict the guilty and exonerate the innocent. It is therefore an essential tool in the criminal justice system. It is important to ensure that the collection and analysis of DNA evidence is done in a way that is rigorous, fair and incorruptible. It is also important to recognise that DNA evidence has the potential to be misused, and to ensure that this does not happen.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the use of DNA evidence to identify a person as a criminal is acceptable. DNA evidence can be used to identify a person as a criminal in a wide variety of cases. DNA evidence is often used to solve crimes that would have otherwise gone unsolved. The use of DNA evidence has helped to convict the guilty and exonerate the innocent. It is therefore an essential tool in the criminal justice system. It is important to ensure that the collection and analysis of DNA evidence is done in a way that is rigorous, fair and incorruptible. The rigorous and incorruptible nature of these processes can be ensured through the monitoring of professional codes of ethics by regulatory bodies, the accountability of handling officers, public confidence, robust processes of evidence collection and a consistent approach to procedures.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the use of DNA evidence to identify a person as a criminal is acceptable. DNA evidence can be used to identify a person as a criminal in a wide variety of cases, sometimes catching suspects who would otherwise have gone unpunished. The use of DNA evidence has helped to convict the guilty and exonerate the innocent. DNA has been a valuable tool in the criminal justice system. It is therefore an essential tool. It is important to ensure that the collection and analysis of DNA evidence is done in a way that is rigorous, fair, and incorruptible. Further, it is essential that potential concerns, particularly related to privacy and misuse of genetic information, are acknowledged and addressed. Conclusion I believe that this experience was a success. As part of their report, participants were given the chance to provide constructive feedback on the workshop, specifically giving comments on what worked and what could be improved. Many of them said that they felt more aware of the value of ethics in science, and that the experience had helped them to learn. Some of the key comments from participants are below: "As a molecular scientist I felt that this workshop has helped me to be more aware of the ethical concerns behind genetics. Before this workshop,
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the use of DNA evidence to identify a person as a criminal is acceptable. DNA evidence can be used to identify a person as a criminal in a wide variety of cases. DNA evidence is often used to solve crimes that would have otherwise gone unsolved. The use of DNA evidence has helped to convict the guilty and exonerate the innocent. It is therefore an essential tool in the criminal justice system. It is important to ensure that the collection and analysis of DNA evidence is done in a way that is rigorous, fair and incorruptible. The use of DNA evidence has dramatically improved the ability of the criminal justice system to deal with crime. However, it is essential that DNA evidence is collected and analysed in a rigorous and fair manner, and that appropriate legal safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of people whose DNA is collected. This will help to ensure that the use of DNA evidence is not misused and that it is used only for its intended purpose.
