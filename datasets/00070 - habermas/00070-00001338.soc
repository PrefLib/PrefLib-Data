# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was opposed to introducing an upper age limit for marriage. Older people such as widows and widowers are still living and have as much right to marry as any other adult. However, the group was opposed to older people marrying people in their teens, or marrying people who are unable to make their own decision about such matters. Finally, the group was also opposed to any legislation that would criminalise marriages for cultural reasons. There is no proof that this has a negative effect and so legislation would be uncalled for.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No, there should be no age limit above which people cannot get married. Marriage is a personal decision and the government should not interfere in this.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: There is no benefit in introducing an age limit on marriage. If two people who are above the age of consent, want to commit to one another, they should be able to do so without age being a barrier. The age limit of 18 for marriage is already quite high, and the law has already provided protections for underage people by not allowing marriage below that age.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be no upper age limit for marriage. Marriage is a personal choice and people should be allowed to make that choice for themselves. If both parties are above the legal age of consent and both parties are willing, then there should be no age limit for marriage.
