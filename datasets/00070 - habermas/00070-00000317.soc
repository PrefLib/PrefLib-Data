# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There is a crisis in the NHS, and it requires extra funding. We need to increase the funding of the NHS, and this is the most important thing that our taxes should be spent on. However, tax increases should be reserved for the richest in society, and for businesses who can afford to pay more. There is no need for taxes to be raised on the average earner.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “The NHS is the best health service in the world, and has been a cornerstone of the British way of life for the last seventy years. The way the NHS has managed to achieve this with only minimal tax contributions from its citizens is remarkable. However, in recent years, the NHS has been in crisis, with long waiting lists, underpaid and overworked staff, and increasingly outdated facilities. If we are to ensure the continued existence of the NHS, we need to address this crisis. This should be done by increasing the proportion of our taxes that goes towards the NHS, as this is the most efficient way to fund it. I think that the majority of the British people would be willing to pay slightly more tax to save the NHS, which I think is the most important thing that our taxes should go towards.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that there is a case for increasing taxes to fund the health service. This should only be the case if it can be shown that this will actually lead to increased and improved healthcare provision. The extent to which taxes should be raised would be up to the Government and its Ministers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “After a long debate, the group have decided that, whilst we agree that the NHS needs more money, we do not think that this should be funded by taxes as this would have a negative effect on the economy, and would result in less money being available to spend on other important things, like education. We think that, instead, the government should seek to invest more in the NHS through private investment.”
