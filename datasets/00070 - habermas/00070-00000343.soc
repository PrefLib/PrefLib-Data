# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The group of participants were broadly in favour of a universal basic income of £10,000 per adult per year but felt it was too low for an adult to live off. The group felt that there were some risks with such an income being adopted but felt it would be a good start and that a higher amount would be preferable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We agree that the UK should adopt a universal basic income of £10,000 per adult per year.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Income is something that is very important to everyone in society. The way we allot income is very important to social equality and fairness. We believe that if a basic income of £10,000 is made available to everyone in the UK that this would be a step in the right direction. The issue is however not so much the amount as how the income is provided. If the money is provided as a grant or lump sum to people this would open the doors to money laundering and it would be open to abuse. If the money was provided to people as a basic wage it would be far more secure. There is the risk that some people will just live off this basic wage and not bother looking for a job. This would be an unfortunate consequence and we would need to find a way of mitigating this. We believe that a basic income would be an important step towards reducing the inequality that is present in the UK today.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: “The United Kingdom should adopt a Universal Basic Income of £10,000 per adult per year, but this should only be for less privileged adults and not all adults. This will enable less privileged people to live a decent life.”
