# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Capitalism is something that has the potential to both help and hinder people's lives. It is entirely dependent on the individual to be successful or not. The potential for success in capitalism is what drives people to work harder and achieve higher goals and better lives for themselves and their families. It is a system that promotes freedom and gives people the chance to do what they want, but it is also a system that can keep people down if they are not able to adapt.  In a second group, the participants discussed the same question. Below is presented the question along with the opinions of each individual participant followed by their final consensus statement.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Capitalism helps improve people's lives. It helps to create opportunity for people to better their lives, and gives people the opportunity to create their own wealth. However, those at the bottom of the ladder are often made much worse off, and it can lead to inequality in society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - “Capitalism has the potential to improve people's lives, however, we believe that some governments and individuals don't treat others with fairness. This doesn't allow everyone the opportunity to have an improved life.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Capitalism does help improve people's lives. However, there are some instances where capitalism has not improved people's lives. For example, in the industrial revolution, the lower class were treated poorly and received very little benefits. Also, the lower class have a limited amount of opportunities available to them and are at a huge disadvantage.
