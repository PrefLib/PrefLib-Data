# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We think that it is crucial for government websites to be accessible to blind people. This is a very important issue that should be addressed as soon as possible. Blind people are not the only people who need to be considered when making websites accessible. In fact, it is much more important to make the internet accessible for people with more severe disabilities. In the UK, we are not doing well in this regard. Websites should be accessible to blind people because it is their right to access information. If we do not make these websites accessible, then we are denying them their right. It is the government's responsibility to help its citizens, and to exclude them from accessing information would be doing the opposite. Blind people should be able to use the internet to do the same things that we can. Therefore, government websites should be accessible to blind people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that government websites should be made accessible to the blind. If they aren't accessible then the government isn't making the web accessible for everyone. If you cannot access a website due to a disability then it is important that it is changed.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the government has a responsibility to ensure that their websites are accessible to all, including the blind. This is important because the government is responsible for disseminating information to all citizens, and this information should be accessible to all. The government has a responsibility to ensure that all citizens are treated equally, and this includes ensuring that websites are accessible to all.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should require all government websites to be made accessible to the blind. We should also require all other websites to be made accessible to the blind. This is because inclusivity is important and because the government has a responsibility to help the less fortunate. The government should set a good example to other websites and make their websites accessible to the blind. The government should also make their websites accessible to those who are deaf or have other disabilities. The government should also make their websites accessible to those who do not have disabilities. This is because it is the right thing to do.
