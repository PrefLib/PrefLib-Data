# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Income is something that people need in order to afford things. The way we allot income is very complex. There are many ways to distribute it. The universal basic income idea seems to be on the rise because of the age of AI and automation which is going to make a lot of jobs obsolete. This means that the government will have to take measures to prevent a spike in poverty levels. The debate is still going on about whether this would work. The participants would like to know more.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: “The introduction of a universal basic income, is not in fact, universal. The current system of benefits and wages is just that, a system. This system needs to be fully examined to ensure that any gaps are plugged so that no one in need is left without help. With this in mind, it may be possible to have a basic income in the future. However, it is important to understand that having a universal basic income is not without its dangers. If we are not careful, it could end up with those that need it most being worse off and those that have enough being even better off. This will only continue to increase inequality.“
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The government should not introduce a universal basic income. The government should instead provide the tools to assist people to earn their own money.  This includes creating opportunities for jobs through investment and innovation, tax breaks and other incentives for small businesses, and providing training and education for those in need. There is a difference between charity and enabling people to support themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: There should be a universal basic income, as it will provide stability and financial security for everyone. It will also reduce the stress of those who are unemployed or are struggling financially. However, this should not be a reason for those to become lazy.
