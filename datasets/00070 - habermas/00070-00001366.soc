# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - It is not okay to own any animal as a pet if you live in a small apartment and are at work all day. There are too many negative effects of this to list. This statement has been reached after taking into account a few factors. The animal is probably being left alone for a long period of time which can make the animal very lonely and cause anxiety. They may also become destructive and aggressive which can cause damage to your home. It can also be dangerous for your animal if there is an accident or a fire in your home. An animal needs attention and it is not right to keep it just for your own pleasure and then leave it alone when it is not convenient. It is also very cruel to keep an animal in a confined space.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - It is not okay to own any animal as a pet if you live in a small apartment and are at work all day. There are several reasons why this would be so. The animal would be alone for many hours and this can cause them a great deal of stress and anxiety. The animal is also very unlikely to have the space it needs for exercise and play which are important for its well being. Animals also require personal care and attention which they will not get if they are left alone. Additionally, we must remember that the animal could damage your home and there is also the possibility of an accident which you would be unable to address if you were not at home. Therefore, although it is not necessarily wrong to own an animal within a small apartment and to be at work all day, we advise you not to do so for the reasons above.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It is not okay to own any animal as a pet if you live in a small apartment and are at work all day. This is because it can be detrimental to the animal's wellbeing. The animal will be left alone for a long period of time which can make the animal very lonely and cause anxiety. They may also become destructive and aggressive which can cause damage to your home. It can also be dangerous for your animal if there is an accident or a fire in your home. Animals need attention and it is not right to keep it just for your own pleasure and then leave it alone when it is not convenient. It is also very cruel to keep an animal in a confined space.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - It is not okay to own any animal as a pet if you live in a small apartment and are at work all day. There are negative effects of this that need to be considered. They include damage to your home caused by the animal being destructive, anxiety and agitation in the animal, and the possibility that the animal may go through health problems without noticing or anything that prevents the animal from feeling comfortable. If you are away from home for a long time, I think it is also not okay because you leave the animal alone. Then, when you go back, it can be difficult for you to build a good relationship. It will also depend on the type of animal you want to have as a pet. For example, fish need less care than cats, dogs, and hamsters and I think fish can be a good pet if you live in an apartment. It is not fair to buy animals that take up a lot of space and then leave them alone all day.
