# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the testing of new drugs and research on non-human animals is ethical. However, it is important that the testing is done in the most humane way possible. The animals should not be subjected to unnecessary pain or suffering, and if there is a possibility that the testing could result in the death of the animal, it should not be done. The testing of new drugs and research on non-human animals is necessary to ensure that the new drugs and research are safe for humans, and so that we can continue to develop new drugs and research that will help to save human lives. The testing of new drugs and research on non-human animals has allowed us to develop the best medicine that we have to date, and we should continue to develop drugs and research to help save human lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Animal testing is ethical, as long as the animals are not subjected to unnecessary pain or suffering, and if there is a possibility that the testing could result in the death of the animal, it should not be done. Animal testing is necessary to ensure that the new drugs and research are safe for humans, and so that we can continue to develop new drugs and research that will help to save human lives.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the testing of new drugs and research on non-human animals is ethical. However, it is important that the testing is done in the most humane way possible. The animals should not be subjected to unnecessary pain or suffering, and if there is a possibility that the testing could result in the death of the animal, it should not be done. The testing of new drugs and research on non-human animals is necessary to ensure that the new drugs and research are safe for humans, and so that we can continue to develop new drugs and research that will help to save human lives. In particular, the testing is important to ensure that there will be no long-term side effects from the new drugs and research, and animal testing is therefore the only way to do this.
