# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of the government subsidising electric vehicles. The group felt that electric vehicles were better for the environment, and that the government should be encouraging their use. However, the group was not in favour of the government subsidising electric vehicles to the point where they were cheaper than petrol/diesel cars, as this would make the cost of petrol/diesel cars artificially high. The group felt that this would be unfair on people who were unable to afford electric vehicles, and that it would also make petrol/diesel cars more expensive to maintain. The group felt that this would be a step too far, and that the government should subsidise electric vehicles to the point where they are roughly the same price as petrol/diesel cars. The group also felt that the government should subsidise the cost of installing electric vehicle charging points, as this would make it easier for people to charge their cars. The group also felt that the government should subsidise the cost of converting petrol/diesel cars to electric cars, as this would make it easier for people to switch to electric vehicles.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the group was in favour of more heavily subsidizing electric vehicles. The group felt that the current subsidies are not enough to encourage people to move to electric vehicles, and that the government should do more to help people make the switch. The group felt that this would be a good way to help the environment and improve air quality. The group also felt that this would help to improve public transport, as people would be less likely to use their cars. However, the group also felt that this alone is not enough. The group felt that improvements to public transport should also be made, and that other measures should be taken to help the environment.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, the group was in favour of the government subsidizing electric vehicles. The main argument for this was to reduce the environmental impact of vehicles, and to encourage the switch to electric cars. However, the group also acknowledged that this alone is not enough, and that other measures should also be taken, such as improving public transport. The group also acknowledged that the cost of electric cars is a barrier for some people, and that this should be subsidized. However, the group did not think that the government should subsidize the cost of the car for everyone, but rather for those who are in need. The group also agreed that if someone is able to afford the cost of an electric car, then they should pay for it themselves.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of more heavily subsidizing electric vehicles. The group agreed that the government should subsidize the cost of electric vehicles, but also that this should not be the only measure taken. Other measures should also be taken, such as improving public transport, and reducing the number of cars on the road. This could be done by increasing the price of petrol and diesel, and using the money raised to improve public transport.
