# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The group came to the consensus view that we believe that the UK is becoming less tolerant of free speech, however we believe that this is a positive thing as people are becoming more aware of how their words can affect others and therefore are more respectful.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - There has been a huge change in the UK becoming less tolerant of free speech. People are afraid to express their opinions in case of the repercussions that could come about. The UK is becoming too soft and people are too easily offended.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The UK is becoming less tolerant of free speech. It is very easy to upset people, especially online and so people are less likely to speak out and say what they feel. Some may even try to avoid controversial topics as they may lose friends or get attacked by strangers. Society is becoming too politically correct and so people are scared of saying things that may seem a little bit extreme, even though it is their right to express their views and opinions.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the U.K. is becoming less tolerant of free speech. As the younger generation are less exposed to diversity of opinion and many have grown up in a “safe” online environment, they are less willing to accept views and opinions which differ from their own.
