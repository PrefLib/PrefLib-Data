# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the current voting system in the UK is considered to be fair and accessible. Most people are happy with the current system, and changing it could potentially lower public engagement in the voting process. While it is true that the current system favours larger parties, and there is potential for this to create an unfair political system, this can be controlled through public engagement. If more people vote for smaller parties that share their views, then this would force larger parties to consider their policies more carefully.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In conclusion, while the current voting system in the UK does seem to work well for the two big parties, it does not allow room for any smaller parties to gain a foothold in parliament, and this is a problem as they may offer better solutions for the country. While there are some issues with the way that other countries vote, such as the risk of extremist parties gaining a foothold in parliament, we should explore changing the system and see what new ideas can be found.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There should be some room for change in the voting system as the current system seems to be too static and people are getting the same options over and over again. While there is a risk of parties becoming too extreme, there is also an opportunity for niche interest parties to gain some traction. Conclusion: Even though there were some participants who were strongly for a change, and others who were strongly against it, by coming together and discussing the question, a consensus view was reached, which could not have been reached if the individuals did not have the chance to debate the question together.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although the current voting system is outdated and has been shown to be unfair, changing the system could create significant problems, therefore we should not change the voting system in the UK.
