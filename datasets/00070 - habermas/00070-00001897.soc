# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Parents should not generally have the right to know the religion of their teachers. Teachers have a right to privacy and as long as the children are being taught the curriculum in a suitable way, it is no one else's business what the religion of the teacher is.  The only caveat is if there seemed to be some of the teachers religious beliefs creeping into the lessons and the teaching. This could be a subtle way to try to influence the pupils' views and this is wholly unacceptable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In general, parents should not have the right to know the religion of their child's teachers. Religion is a private and personal choice and should not influence the quality or effectiveness of a person's teaching. The only caveat is if there seemed to be some of the teachers religious beliefs creeping into the lessons and the teaching. This could be a subtle way to try to influence the pupils' views and this is wholly unacceptable.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No, parents should not have the right to know the religion of their child's teachers. This is a private matter for the teacher and it should not influence their teaching.
