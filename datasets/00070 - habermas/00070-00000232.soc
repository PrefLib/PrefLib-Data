# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: People should be allowed to pay for a better education for their children, however we believe that all children should have equal access to a good education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Paying for a better education for children should be allowed, but only to the extent that it does not disrupt the quality of education available in the public system.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We have come to the decision that, as long as it is not done in a way that disadvantages children from poor backgrounds, paying for a better education is an option that should be open to all parents. We believe that some public schools are not up to standard and that some private schools do offer a better education.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, people should be allowed to pay for a better education for their children if they can afford to. A child's future should not be restricted by their parent's income. In some countries, it is the law that parents pay for their children's education beyond secondary school. This is often not enforced. It would be better if these costs were simply included in taxation. If everyone was taxed more, we would all benefit from a better education system.
