# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I do not think that employers should be made to set aside a percentage of their profits for employees as employers already pay a wage to their employees.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I believe that they should - it doesn't have to be a huge amount but it can be a win-win for both parties. If employees are more likely to be rewarded in this way they are more likely to work harder to achieve their success. It could also encourage better job loyalty/staff retention with a more committed workforce.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No they shouldn't. The boss of any organization should never be paid more than 15 times the lowest paid worker, but it doesn't mean that employees should get a percentage of the profits. How would you work out who was more deserving, the cleaner on £11 an hour doing his  job efficiently or the receptionist whose work can't be quantified? It doesn't make sense. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Yes, employers should be required to set aside a percentage of their profits for their employees. Ideally if this was the case, it would be more fair on employees with how much they contribute to the company when majority of the time they are receiving minimum wage. If anything, the extra wage from the employers pockets would be a bonus & would be appreciated by all. 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: I would say it depends how much the employees already make as a standard. if they do not make much then I agree a percentage of profit should be required, not too much but enough for the employee to be making decent money.
