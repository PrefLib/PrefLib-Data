# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the group was in favour of making it easier for people to repay their student loans, however, there was a strong feeling that this should only be done in cases where the person is struggling for genuine reasons.  The group felt that student loans are a necessary evil in today's society and that they should be made as easy to repay as possible.  The group also felt that there should be a greater number of educational options available to people other than university.  They felt that the educational options should include less academic routes and more vocational routes.

# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Student loans are a necessary evil in today's society.  The government should make it easier for people to pay off their student loans, but only in cases where the person is genuinely struggling to repay.  This could be done by amending the repayment threshold to take into account that not all students will end up in high paying jobs.  There should be a greater number of educational options available to people other than university, but university should still remain an option for those who would benefit most from it.
