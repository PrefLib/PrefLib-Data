# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I think it's very difficult for me to say this when all I have is a perception of what tolerance is like is the US and so to make generalisations based on perceptions and media snapshots is not ok! From the news, you would think that the US is highly polarised but I don't know how it is like for the majority of people on the ground and in their everyday lives. What I can say is that I have witnessed both the good and bad, in terms of tolerance in the UK in my life. There is clearly intolerance in the UK, but there is much good about the tolerance in many aspects of UK life- Is the US more tolerant- I couldn't even begin to say!
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: I think overall the UK is more tolerant in the US. We have laws in place to make sure that everyone is treated equally and are not prejudiced against.  I think the British public are welcoming and accommodating to most people that want to live here and try ti help them to integrate with UK customs. We are a very hospitable people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Honestly I read this question and was not entirely sure how to respond. I guess it depends on what you are referring to, but also not sure on the word 'tolerant' itself. Tolerant in what respect. I am honestly not sure what this question is referring to therefore am unable to give a response here. Perhaps a better word would be more accepting?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No the uk is not more tolerant than the usa The usa deal with criminals. uk haven't got a clue. This is why we have criminals doing things time and time again.
