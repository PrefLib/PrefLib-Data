# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People should have a legal duty to recycle. The legal duty would have to be carefully constructed as not all materials are easily recyclable and some people find it harder to recycle than others (e.g. not everyone has recycling bins outside their homes). This is because the law has the potential to go too far, but also has the potential to do a lot of good.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should have a legal duty to recycle. However, this should be implemented in a way that is easy for people to do. There should be no punishments for those who are unable to recycle. Instead, recycling should be encouraged through education and making it as easy as possible for people to recycle. There should be recycling bins in every town and city, with clear instructions on what can and cannot be recycled. The recycling industry should be transparent in how they recycle waste. The group of participants also came up with the following recommendations: There should be more education in schools on the importance of recycling and how to do it. Recycling should be made as easy as possible for people, for example, by having recycling bins in every town and city. The government should provide more funding for the recycling industry to ensure that recycling is done in the most efficient way possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - While we all agree that recycling is a good idea and we all want to see it promoted, we do not feel it should be made mandatory. We feel that there are already strong social norms in place that mean that most people do recycle, and these should be encouraged. However, the government should take steps to ensure that recycling is made easier, and that the level of recycling is increased. This should be done through better education, making recycling bins more accessible, and improving the recycling infrastructure. The government should also ensure that it does not use products that cannot be recycled.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - People should have a legal duty to recycle. However, there should be a certain degree of flexibility as to what can and can't be recycled. This is because not everything can be recycled. The law should also not be too strict as this would lead to people trying to get around the law. However, the law should be strict enough to ensure that people are recycling as much as possible.
