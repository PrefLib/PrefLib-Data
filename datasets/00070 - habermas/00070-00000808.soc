# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, teachers need to be highly educated individuals in order to teach their subject to the best of their ability. Teachers teach all the way upto the age of 18 so need. degree level subject knowledge in order to teach this to a really good level. The current standards already exist for a reason and that is because there are requirements and certain standards that should always be met. If there are issues with retaining teachers then we should be looking at other issues related to teacher retention rather than making it easier for anyone to just become a teacher because teaching isn't easy and if anything the problem with retention could then get even worse and standards could drop further. I believe this is looking at solving a problem from the wrong end and rather than finding a solution will only produce more issues and problems long term.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We have come to the decision that the current standards are good enough and that there is no need to make it easier for people to become teachers. We believe that teachers need to be highly educated individuals in order to teach their subject to the best of their ability. Teachers teach all the way upto the age of 18 so need degree level subject knowledge in order to teach this to a really good level. We believe that if there are issues with retaining teachers then we should be looking at other issues related to teacher retention rather than making it easier for anyone to just become a teacher because teaching isn't easy and if anything the problem with retention could then get even worse and standards could drop further. We believe this is looking at solving a problem from the wrong end and rather than finding a solution will only produce more issues and problems long term.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we should not make it easier for people to become teachers. The current standards already exist for a reason and that is because there are requirements and certain standards that should always be met. If there are issues with retaining teachers then we should be looking at other issues related to teacher retention rather than making it easier for anyone to just become a teacher because teaching isn't easy and if anything the problem with retention could then get even worse and standards could drop further. I believe this is looking at solving a problem from the wrong end and rather than finding a solution will only produce more issues and problems long term.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we should not make it easier for people to become teachers. Teachers are highly educated individuals and the current standards should be maintained. This will help ensure that students are taught to the highest standards. It is also important that we maintain a high bar of entry to the profession as it is an important and trusted profession. If there are issues with teacher retention, then we should be looking at other issues related to teacher retention rather than making it easier for anyone to just become a teacher.
