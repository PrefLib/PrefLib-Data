# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: There should be a role for faith schools in a modern society. However, the role should be limited to teaching the pupils about other religions and promoting tolerance and understanding. There should be no religious instruction in faith schools.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: 
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In a modern society we should allow faith schools, but there must be a balance between faith schools and non faith schools. This is because we want children to be exposed to a wide variety of faiths, but also a balance so that no child feels they are being 'sold' a religion.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of faith schools, though some reservations were expressed. The general feeling was that faith schools are beneficial for the children who attend them and the wider society. The group felt that faith schools are an important part of a multicultural society and are beneficial for teaching children about other religions. It was felt that children should be taught about all religions and that this would promote tolerance and understanding. The group also felt that it is important for children to be able to practice their own religion and that faith schools allow this to happen. The group did express some reservations about faith schools. Some felt that they were elitist and that they were not inclusive of all children. Some also felt that the quality of education in faith schools was not as good as in non faith schools. The group felt that it is important for all children to have the same opportunities and that faith schools can create an uneven playing field. The group felt that the curriculum in faith schools is too narrow and that it does not allow children to explore other religions and cultures.
