# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - “Yes, I think that we need to build Nuclear Power Stations. The earth is running out of fossil fuels, so we need to look at alternative methods. If we can create our own power, it should also help to lower costs as it will reduce the reliance on having to buy from other nations. However, cleaner and more sustainable options should be explored first.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - “I think that we need to build Nuclear Power Stations. The earth is running out of fossil fuels, so we need to look at alternative methods. If we can create our own power, it should also help to lower costs as it will reduce the reliance on having to buy from other nations. However, for some, a focus on wind and solar energy may be preferable to building a new nuclear power station. We are already far into a still growing climate emergency, and need all sources of non-fossil fuel and low emission energy we can get.”
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of building a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. The group agreed that it was a good idea to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, however, it would be better to explore other alternative energy sources before building another nuclear plant.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Although there are good arguments for and against the building of a new nuclear power station, the group came to the consensus view that a new nuclear power station should be built at Hinkley Point. This is because the earth is running out of fossil fuels, and we need to look at alternative methods. If we can create our own power, it should also help to lower costs as it will reduce the reliance on having to buy from other nations.
