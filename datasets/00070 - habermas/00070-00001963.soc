# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, we were in favour of factory farming. We agreed that it is the most cost-effective and efficient way of providing meat to the world and that it is necessary for feeding the increasing population. It also has many benefits for the animals. For example, they are not living in pain for long periods of time, as it is the most efficient way of producing the most amount of meat in the shortest amount of time. However, we also agreed that factory farming isn't the most ethical way of producing meat. Although we thought that conditions need to be improved, the group was split regarding alternatives, such as lab-grown meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of factory farming as it is the most cost-effective way of providing meat to the world. It is also the most practical way of feeding the increasing world population. The group also recognised that factory farming has many benefits for the animals. For example, it is the most efficient way of producing the most amount of meat in the shortest amount of time, which means the animals are not living in pain for long periods of time. However, the group was also in favour of making the conditions of factory farming better, such as allowing the animals to have more space. The group also recognised that factory farming is not the most ethical way of producing meat and that there are many alternatives, such as lab-grown meat.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of factory farming as it is the most cost-effective way of providing meat to the world. It is also the most practical way of feeding the increasing world population. The group also recognised that factory farming has many benefits for the animals. For example, it is the most efficient way of producing the most amount of meat in the shortest amount of time, which means the animals are not living in pain for long periods of time. The group was also of the view that there are many alternatives to factory farming and that we could definitely do a lot to improve the conditions of factory farms so they are more ethical. For example, allowing the animals more space. However, in a world of increasing global population, meat is needed in our diets. Thus, in a perfect world, the group thought factory farming would need to be improved, but in the current state of the world, and with the knowledge that many would starve without these farms, factory farming is the best option to ensure meat is provided for everyone across the world.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of factory farming as it is the most cost-effective way of providing meat to the world. It is also the most practical way of feeding the increasing world population. The group also recognised that factory farming has many benefits for the animals. For example, it is the most efficient way of producing the most amount of meat in the shortest amount of time, which means the animals are not living in pain for long periods of time.
