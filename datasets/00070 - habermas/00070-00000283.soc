# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: In general, the safety of the public is paramount. For this reason, we agree that wearing a helmet while cycling should be mandatory as it reduces the risk of head injury and in the long term reduces the impact on the NHS. As with wearing a seatbelt in a car, it is a small price to pay for a big protection. The evidence for this is overwhelming, and we believe that this is the best way to protect the public and to reduce the amount of head injuries that occur as a result of cycling accidents. Although all the participants were not in complete agreement, they were all able to put their views forward in a civilised manner and ultimately came to a consensus which all of them could live with. The final consensus statement was not an easy one to reach, and each of the participants changed their initial opinions slightly as a result of the debate.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Cycling is a dangerous activity as it is not always in your control. The issue of whether cyclists should be forced to wear a helmet is debatable. It could be argued that wearing a helmet is a personal choice as to whether the person would like to wear one or not and it could be seen as a symbol of a society moving forward if the rules and regulations are becoming stricter for everyone. The other side of the argument is that if the helmet is mandatory it could increase the number of cyclists. We came to the consensus that we believe it should be mandatory for cyclists to wear helmets. The main reason being that if the cyclist was involved in an accident, it could cause damage to the brain. Even if the cyclist was to break their neck, a helmet could prevent them from dying. A helmet is a way of protecting the person's head. It could be a good way of protecting them if they were to hit a brick wall, the helmet could potentially save their life. Some cyclists think that they are being attacked on the roads by the drivers and that they are trying to kill them, but the cyclists have to understand that the roads are not their own and that they should be
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The law should make it mandatory to wear a helmet while cycling. It will help save lives. The people who believe they can safely ride a bike without a helmet are likely to be involved in an accident that they could have survived if they were wearing a helmet.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: It is the opinion of the group that cyclists should be made to wear helmets in order to reduce injuries caused by accidents. This was a difficult topic for me to discuss with my group and come to a consensus on because I don't know if it is correct to force cyclists to wear helmets as it infringes on their freedom. However, as some of my group have pointed out, accidents happen and can have fatal consequences, so by wearing a helmet the consequences of an accident can be lessened, which in the end, is in everyone's best interest.
