# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Yes, all healthcare should be free.  Healthcare is a basic human right, and as such everyone should have the same access to it, regardless of wealth or status.  The only exception would be certain elective cosmetic surgeries, but these would be for exceptional cases and not the norm.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that the current system of free healthcare at the point of use is the best option for the UK. The NHS is something for this country to be proud of and it must be maintained for the good of all. Many people would not be able to afford health care if every single item or procedure had to be paid for. Healthcare is the mark of a civilised society. We believe that more money needs to be invested into healthcare as the waiting time is really long and I think they need to re-think how they use the tax amount. We believe that having only the rich receive better healthcare is greatly unjust and would not represent the type of society we would like to be a part of. A healthy population is more likely to produce a healthy economy. We believe that every single human has the right to access healthcare without being forced into poverty, and free healthcare is a step in that direction.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Healthcare should be free for all citizens and we should not privatise the NHS as we don't want to lose what makes the UK unique. However, the NHS must be fully funded to ensure it can meet the needs of its citizens.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was in favour of free healthcare.  However, they also recognised that this would not be possible without taxing the wealthiest in society.  It was felt that there would need to be a balance between the cost of providing healthcare and the tax burden on the wealthiest in society.  The group felt that the current tax system was not fair and that it would be necessary to introduce a more progressive tax system.
