# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Although devolution has worked well in recent years, it is clear that the current system does not allow the Scottish people to make their own choices and decisions about their own future. It is therefore clear that Scotland should be given the opportunity to vote for independence. The Scottish people should have the opportunity to control their own future, to make their own mistakes and to prosper on their own terms.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Scotland should be given a second referendum on independence. It is very important that the political parties are completely clear on what independence would mean for Scotland. This way the public can fully understand what they are voting for.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Scotland should be given a second referendum on independence. The people of Scotland should have the right to vote for their own self-determination and to make their own choices for their future. Independence is a right that they should be able to exercise.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the idea of self-determination is incredibly important in a modern democracy. However, there are no guarantees that an independent Scotland will be as stable as it is today. The opinion of the participants about the question were not exactly the same but they all had a different perspective about it.
