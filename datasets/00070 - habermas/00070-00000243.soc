# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - The smoking ban in pubs has had mixed results. From the perspective of the public health and people who do not smoke, it has been an excellent step in the right direction and pubs are now much safer places for everyone to use. On the other hand, the ban has had a detrimental effect on the trade of pubs, especially in towns up and down the country where they have become less busy or have closed down altogether.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The smoking ban has been a good thing. However, the ban should have been introduced in a more effective manner. Instead of the government making the ban compulsory, the decision to ban smoking in pubs should have been left to the proprietors themselves. If they wanted to allow smoking in their premises, then it should have been their right to do so. However, it would have been better if the ban had been more strictly enforced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the introduction of the smoking ban in pubs has been a good thing. Most people do not like being subjected to the smell of cigarette smoke when in public places, especially in enclosed areas such as pubs and restaurants. There is also strong evidence to support the view that second hand smoke causes severe health issues. It is also believed that these health issues have been curtailed by the smoking ban. However, there are many opponents to the smoking ban. They point out that people still smoke, whether they are in a pub or at home. And in fact it has been noted that the smoking ban has caused a huge loss of trade in pubs and clubs. There is also strong evidence to support the view that there are huge costs to the local economies when pubs and clubs close down. Many people do not enjoy drinking at home and smoking in the pub is a big part of the overall enjoyment of a night out for them.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The introduction of the smoking ban has been a good thing in many ways, although some people who smoke and are regulars in pubs are clearly going to disagree with this view. Some may even say that the ban is an infringement of their civil liberties. However, the ban has undoubtedly had a positive effect on public health, especially as regards passive smoking. The ban has also made pubs more accessible for families, which is a positive thing. This means that the pub remains an important part of the community and is a positive place for families and children to spend time together. We have come to the conclusion that the introduction of the smoking ban has been a good thing.
