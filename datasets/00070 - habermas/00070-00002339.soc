# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In conclusion, the group have come to the consensus opinion that we are in the midst of a climate crisis. This is due to the significant changes in the weather that have been occurring worldwide. There has been a rise in temperatures in many countries across the world, which is causing many issues. The weather is becoming more and more extreme, with the occurrence of heat waves, forest fires and flooding becoming more and more common. These issues are only going to get worse as time goes on. This is causing a huge amount of concern for the future of the planet and it is vital that something is done to try and mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - Yes, we are in the midst of a climate crisis. We are continually made aware of the crisis through the news and media and moreover we experience the crisis everyday ourselves with the weather extremes we experience, like extreme heat, mild winters and how plants grow in the garden. There is also significant evidence with weather patterns that the effects are already causing major global issues. Man made climate change is the cause of most of the changes to the Earth and the natural environment. We must make radical changes in order to halt and try to start to reverse the effects.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - There is significant evidence to suggest that the world is currently in the midst of a climate crisis. The evidence is clear to see, from the weather extremes that we experience in our everyday lives to the news and media coverage that is prevalent. The crisis is also evident in the natural environment, with the effects of climate change evident in the way plants grow, the weather and the way the seasons are changing. The crisis is also evident in the increase of endangered species and the rise in temperature across the globe. The crisis is not going away and it is only going to get worse if we don't act now.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Yes, we are in the midst of a climate crisis. We are continually made aware of the crisis through the news and media and moreover we experience the crisis everyday ourselves with the weather extremes we experience, like extreme heat, mild winters and how plants grow in the garden. There are currently an array of observable negative consequences of global warming that researchers and global activists are raising our awareness of. Including the melting of ice caps, the deterioration of the coral reef and rising sea levels and temperatures. I don't think that it's possible to deny that these issues are not the case, and it's evident that these issues are only going to get worse. Initially these issues were only raised via important figures and the media, but these effects are only becoming more evidence to our every day lives as the issues get worse and worse, so it's undeniably a huge issue at the moment that requires imminent action.
