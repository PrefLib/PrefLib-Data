# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - People have the right to be stupid. The government should not interfere with personal responsibility and should only advise people of the dangers of consuming high sugar soft drinks. They should advise but not ban. The consensus view was eventually met with huge opposition from participants and others who wanted to weigh in. Here are some of the responses: Participant 1: Can't believe this, how can you vote on something like this? This is a matter of individual responsibility and freedom. I also feel that if you're going to ban soft drinks, you should also ban alcohol and fatty foods. The reason why I voted no is because I don't want to ban something and make it harder for people to get it. Participant 2: I couldn't disagree more with the statement you came to. While I agree that people should have the right to be stupid, we as a society should not be encouraging them to be so. Banning products is always a bad idea, but in this case I believe it's warranted.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, we do not agree with a ban on the sale of soft drinks. The issue of obesity needs to be addressed but banning things is never the answer. However, we feel that labelling of sugar content should be made compulsory to give the consumer more information to make a choice, and the education system should do more to teach children about nutrition.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, we should not ban the sale of soft drinks that are high in sugar. We believe that people should have the freedom to choose what they consume, and that it is not the role of the government to tell people what they can and cannot consume. We believe that it is the role of parents and schools to educate children about the dangers of consuming too much sugar, and that it is the role of the food industry to provide more healthy alternatives to sugary drinks.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we should not ban the sale of soft drinks that are high in sugar. The government should not be allowed to ban the sale of any product that is not illegal. This would be a step too far and would be an infringement on personal freedom. The government should, however, be doing more to educate people on healthy eating and the dangers of consuming too much sugar.
