# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We think that there is a possibility that humans could colonise the moon in the future, but the likelihood of this occurring is low. We think that although there may be a possibility that humans will ever colonise the moon, it is highly unlikely. We think that for this to occur, we would have to get to a point where our planet is no longer habitable for human life, and there is no alternative. However, there are too many factors that could prevent this from happening. We do not think that there is a need for this to happen, and we believe that we could solve any problems that occur on this planet without the need for us to colonise the moon.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We do not think that we will be able to colonise the moon, but if we were able to, we would want to.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We have the technology to colonise the moon, but we don't have the will to do so. The moon is a natural next step for us to take in terms of exploring our universe, but the cost of doing so is too great for us to justify doing so. The moon is also not habitable for human beings, and would require extensive terraforming in order to make it suitable for human habitation. This is not a process that we are likely to be able to do in the near future, and so the moon is not a viable option for human colonisation.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In principle, yes, we could colonise the moon. Whether this is a good idea is another question entirely.
