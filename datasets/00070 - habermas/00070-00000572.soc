# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Given the current economic situation, the government should increase taxes, however this should be done in a fair way. A system should be put in place where tax payers get to choose where they want their money to go towards. Tax payers money should not be wasted and should be invested in schools, hospitals and public transport. It would also be a good idea to invest in more energy efficient buildings, so that the country can be more self sufficient and less dependent on importing energy. The increase in taxes shouldn't be too high so that the public can cope with the change. This should be offset by taxing large corporations more, so that the country is still attractive to big businesses.

Conclusion This was a useful exercise, particularly when you take into account that these participants were all 16 or 17 year olds from a country that does not have a culture of consensus building. Through the consensus building process, the group managed to come to a good consensus view, one that reflects all of their views in some way, and is a good compromise between all the participants views.
