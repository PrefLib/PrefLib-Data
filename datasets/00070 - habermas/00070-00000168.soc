# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although not legally obliged to do so, and we realise that this would mean certain individuals in high political office would not want to become involved in politics, we believe that politicians should be transparent in their financial affairs. They should disclose their salary and income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of declaring the incomes of all politicians. They argued that as all citizens have to declare their income, then it's only fair that politicians have to declare theirs too. There was also the view that if they had nothing to hide, they should have nothing to worry about. However, the group did concede that this might be more difficult for politicians, as they do get many gifts from companies and individuals. For example, it was pointed out that at election time politicians get many free dinners and gifts from companies and private individuals. These freebies could amount to several thousand pounds and it might be difficult to know exactly how much these gifts were worth. In the end, the group decided that the costs of these freebies should be calculated and added to the declared income.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion, yes we should all declare our income and in fact, anything we receive, as it is part of our moral duty to be honest. This should be the case for all MPs too.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - Politicians should be required to disclose their income. They work for the public and therefore they should declare their income. In the interest of transparency and democracy this is something that is essential to ensure trust and honesty.
