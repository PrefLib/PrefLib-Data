# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - We should ban single-use plastic bottles and instead promote biodegradable alternatives. Also, more water fountains should be installed in public places for people to use and refill their own bottles with free water" How well did the group do at reaching a consensus?
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We believe that single use plastic bottles should be banned as soon as possible. The main reason for this is the amount of harm that they cause to the environment, animals and people. They do not break down and so, are an ever-present issue, and are so damaging to the environment. It is very important that we as a community work together to get rid of these plastic bottles. It is the responsibility of the community to ban these products and stop the damage to our planet. The government must also play their part in educating the people on the dangers of these bottles and how to prevent the use of them. People can use their own bottles, this can be made compulsory in the schools. The students can be encouraged to use reusable bottles for their water. This will also benefit the student as they will not be spending so much money on bottled water. The government needs to do more to raise awareness of this problem and take more serious actions to reduce the damage that we are causing.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - Yes, we should ban single-use plastic bottles. They are bad for the environment and we should use biodegradable alternatives instead.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We should ban single-use plastic bottles.  It is important to provide people with alternatives such as free water fountains and encourage them to use their own reusable bottles.  We also need to make the industry more accountable for their actions and provide consumers with plastic free alternatives.  The industry needs to be more transparent about the contents of their products and the effect they have on the environment and people.  We also need to make governments more accountable for their actions and help them to implement this ban on single use plastics.  It is important that we make this ban as soon as possible.
