# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We think that the way the House of Lords is constituted should be changed. We don't think that a group of unelected, mainly wealthy, privileged people should be given power over anything. It's an idea from medieval times and doesn't fit in with modern politics. We don't even know how they decide if someone gets in. We think it should be voted for by the public and be open to people from all walks of life to make it representative of the people.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: In general, the house of lords is an outdated institution which needs to be reformed to better reflect the views of the people. There should be more transparency about who is in the house of lords and how they got there. There should be more information about what is discussed and decided in the house of lords, and the public should have more of a say in what is decided.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: The House of Lords should be made up of people voted for by the general public to make it more representative of the people. There should also be some academics in there too to give a wider view on issues. The participants also decided that some of the members of the house of lords should be a cross-party group as well to prevent too much bias. Participants views are likely to have been influenced by their own political views, their social class and upbringing, as well as the opinions of the other members of the group.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of changing the way the House of Lords is constituted. They felt that it was important for the House of Lords to be representative of the people and that the current system was not representative enough. They felt that the current system was too secretive and that there was not enough information about how the House of Lords is constituted and how decisions are made. They felt that the current system was unfair and that it was not democratic enough. They felt that the current system was out of date and did not reflect the needs of the modern world. They felt that the current system was not accountable enough and that the people who were in the House of Lords were not accountable to the people.
