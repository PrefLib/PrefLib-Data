# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - Although the arts are important and deserve some funding, other issues and priorities have to take precedence.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - The arts are a nice to have, but not as important as other areas of government spending. The government should only spend money on the arts if there are sufficient funds available.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - The arts are a fundamental part of society, but not in a position to be a priority during a time of economic hardship.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the arts are good for society. They are a great way for people to relax, and can be very stimulating to be involved in. However, in times like these where there is an economic crisis, the arts are not as important as other things such as the NHS and education. These should be the priorities.
