# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - No, people should not be allowed to own and keep guns in their homes. This is because guns can easily be taken from homes and used in other places like schools, where they can harm many innocent people. Also, many people have died in their own homes due to accidental gun discharge and targeted gun incidents. There is nothing that can justify owning and keeping guns in the home.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - People should not be allowed to own and keep guns in their homes. This is because there are more ways of protecting your home other than owning and keeping guns in the home. Guns will easily find their way into the hands of teenagers who will then use it in school shootings, and in a break-up scenario one partner might use it to harm the other. As such, owning and keeping guns in the home is not a good idea.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - No, people should not be allowed to own and keep guns in their homes. We live in a society where we have laws and rules and if we break them there are consequences. If people are allowed to own guns in their homes, this will lead to more deaths, more school shootings and more terrorist attacks. The only people that should be allowed to own guns are the police and the army. If people are living in dangerous situations a gun might offer them protection and make them feel safer. There should be other ways for protection though, not guns.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - The group felt that people should not be allowed to own and keep guns in their homes. This is because of the danger that the guns will be taken out of the house and used in other places and incidents that will lead to serious injury or death. It was suggested that gun ownership should be strictly controlled and owners should be very heavily vetted. The group discussed what would happen if the police were to remove guns from homes, and it was felt that it would lead to violent uprising from the people who own guns, as it has done in the US. However, it was also felt that the US have more shootings and deaths than in the UK and so this is a reason why gun ownership should be strictly controlled and reduced, not increased.
