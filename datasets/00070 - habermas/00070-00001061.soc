# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was against legalising recreational drugs. They felt that it would lead to more people taking drugs, more mental health issues and more strain on health services. They felt that there would need to be proper regulation in place to ensure that it was not abused and that it would not lead to more harm. They felt that it was not worth the risk of legalising recreational drugs.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was against legalising recreational drugs. The main arguments put forward were that it would create more addicts, more strain on the health system, more deaths, more crime, and more pressure on the police. However, it was recognised that it would also remove the black market and the criminals involved in it. It was also recognised that the police have better things to do than deal with drug cases. It was also recognised that some recreational drugs are not as harmful as others, but the difficulty is knowing where to draw the line. The consensus view was that legalising some drugs for recreational use would be a very difficult thing to regulate and that it would be very difficult to know where to draw the line. The group felt that there would be more negatives than positives if some recreational drugs were legalised.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - It was thought that the legalisation of some drugs for recreational use would allow for a more open discussion about the harmful effects of drugs and this would lead to less people taking drugs recreationally, especially if they were educated about the dangers of drug use. It was also thought that the legalisation of drugs for recreational use would create more jobs and more money for the state. However, the group also thought that if some drugs were legalised for recreational use, it would encourage more people to take drugs recreationally and it would also lead to more people becoming addicted to drugs and needing help for their addiction. It was also thought that some people would use drugs recreationally to a point where they would become a burden on the health system and this would take money and resources away from other people in need of health services.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that there is too much evidence for the negative health consequences of drugs, such as cannabis and amphetamines, to be legalised for recreational use.
