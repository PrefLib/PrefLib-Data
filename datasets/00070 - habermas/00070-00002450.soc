# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - No, we should not ban all private jets. The issue of private jets is not as simple as it seems. Private jets are not all the same, and they are not all used in the same way. For example, some private jets are used for emergency medical evacuations. These jets can be used to save lives, and it would be a shame to ban them. Some private jets are used by people who are famous and are constantly followed by fans and paparazzi. For these people, private jets can be a necessity, and it would be unfair to ban them. Private jets are also used by business people. These people are often very busy, and they need to get to meetings and conferences as quickly as possible. It would be unfair to ban these people from using private jets. It is true that private jets are not good for the environment. However, private jets are a necessity for some people, and banning them would be unfair.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was opposed to banning private jets. The group felt that it would be unfair to people who use private jets for work purposes. The group also felt that people should be allowed to spend their money in the way they want to. However, the group did agree that more sustainable practices should be encouraged. The group also felt that more efficient regulations should be introduced.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - No, we should not ban all private jets. Private jets are a massive luxury. However, it may be worthwhile having some kind of limitations on their uses in order to benefit the environment. Taking a private jet for a short distance that could be made in a car is not an environmentally friendly idea. However, on outright ban is not necessary or fair as some people in the world would be hounded by fans if they were to get on a commercial flight.
