# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: We believe that the government should use taxes to redistribute wealth. We feel that there is an obscene amount of wealth sitting in bank accounts doing absolutely nothing of value to society beyond making interest to match inflation for it's owner. In many cases, this wealth is earnt via unfair business practices such as having employees earn minimum wage when their labour is worth multiples more. We have so many problems as a society and a country that could be solved by taking those accounts and 'trimming the fat'. We believe that there would need to be a clear and well thought out taxation plan in place for this to be successful, but we know ourselves as tax payers, we would rather see our money go towards lowering the poverty rate in the uk and evening out the economy,  than it going towards MP's bonuses etc.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: We all agreed that the government should consider this option but there are a few caveats that will have to be satisfied first: 1. The taxation system would have to be changed to tax wealth rather than income. This is the only way to guarantee that all people pay a fair tax based on their capacity to pay, not just a tax based on how much they happen to earn in a year. 2. In order to make sure that those on low incomes are not taxed at all, there would have to be a basic tax free income which everyone is entitled to. This would provide a guaranteed minimum income for all. 3. Any extra income from wealth taxation would be distributed as a basic income to all members of society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: We believe that there should be a certain amount of tax to redistribute wealth to allow for more people to get more of a fair chance at a better life.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: In general, the group was in favour of the idea of redistributing wealth through taxation. It was felt that the current system is unfair and that some people have an excessive amount of wealth whilst others struggle to make ends meet. It was felt that this could be addressed through a carefully considered taxation plan. However, it was also felt that there is a risk that some people could be worse off as a result of such a plan and so it would be important to ensure that this was not the case.
