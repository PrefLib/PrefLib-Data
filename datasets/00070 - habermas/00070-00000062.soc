# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: The government has been slow to act on child obesity and in many ways is still failing to act. This is largely due to the lobbying power of big business and think tanks like the Institute of Economic Affairs. The government should demand that schools ensure their pupils are more active and take part in meaningful physical education. Also, the government should be more active in its efforts to crack down on the advertising of harmful snacks to children. Finally, the government should not just add sugar taxes to products but should rather provide more help in the form of vouchers towards salads/vegetables and even vouchers for children's gym access.  Comments: The consensus statement successfully takes into account all of the opinions expressed by participants. It does not seem to have taken into account the critiques of the draft consensus statement however.
