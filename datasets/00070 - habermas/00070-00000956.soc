# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, financial support should be available equally to the self-employed and those who work for employers. Those working for employers have advantages in worker protections and pension contributions, while the self-employed have advantages in what they charge and the hours they work, but may go for long periods without work. In either case, periods of financial hardship should be supported by the government because both pay income tax and National Insurance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - We should provide financial support to the self-employed as well as those who work for employers. The self-employed contribute a great deal to the economy, but they also have more financial insecurity. The employed have more financial security, but they also have fewer opportunities to start their own businesses. Conclusion: We are in agreement that the self-employed and the employed should be treated equally and have access to the same financial support. The self-employed are just as important to the economy as the employed and they should be treated equally.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the self-employed and those who work for employers should have equal access to financial support. The self-employed are more likely to have periods of financial hardship, but they also have periods of higher income. Those who work for employers have more protection in terms of hours and pay, but may not have the same flexibility as the self-employed. In general, the government should support all workers equally, whether they are self-employed or work for employers, as they all pay income tax and National Insurance.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - We believe that financial support should be available equally to the self-employed and those who work for employers. Those working for employers have advantages in worker protections and pension contributions, while the self-employed have advantages in what they charge and the hours they work, but may go for long periods without work. In either case, periods of financial hardship should be supported by the government because both pay income tax and National Insurance.
