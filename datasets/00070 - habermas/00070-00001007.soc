# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - In general, the group was in favour of legalising marijuana for recreational use.  The main reason for this was that it is not a particularly harmful drug and is less harmful than alcohol.  It is also a useful treatment for some medical conditions.  The group thought that if it was legalised then it would be easier to control the quality of the drug and the THC content.  It would also free up police time to deal with more serious crimes.  However, the group thought that the age of purchase should be raised to 18 and that there should be a limit on the amount of marijuana that can be purchased at any one time.  The group also thought that there should be a ban on smoking in public places.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, the group was in favour of legalising recreational marijuana use but with some reservations.  The reservations included the concern that people would abuse it and that it could have a negative impact on young people.  However, it was felt that if it was legalised, then it could be sold in a safe way and that it could be used to generate revenue for the health service and the education service.  It was felt that the current laws are not working and that there are many people who use it and will continue to use it whether it is legal or not.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In general, the group was in favour of legalising marijuana for recreational use. However, there were some concerns about the health effects of marijuana and also the potential for children to access it. It was agreed that if marijuana was legalised, it should be tightly controlled and regulated to ensure that children would not have easy access to it. It was also agreed that if marijuana was legalised, the government should invest some of the tax revenue in public health campaigns to educate people about the potential harms of marijuana.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - In general, the group was opposed to the legalisation of recreational marijuana use.  However, they recognised that there were some benefits to legalisation and some of the participants were in favour of it.  The group recognised that there was a need for more research to be done on the effects of marijuana on the human body and whether there are any medicinal uses for it.  The group also recognised that there were some benefits to legalisation, including taxation of the drug, regulation of THC content and the freeing up of police time to deal with more serious offences.  The group was in favour of the decriminalisation of marijuana use.  The group felt that the current penalties for possession of marijuana were too severe and that the penalties should be reduced.  The group felt that people should have the right to choose whether they wanted to use marijuana recreationally or not.  The group was in favour of the legalisation of medicinal marijuana use.  The group felt that there were many benefits to the legalisation of medicinal marijuana, including the fact that it would be regulated and therefore safer to use.  The group also recognised that there were many benefits to the legalisation of medicinal marijuana, including the fact that it would
