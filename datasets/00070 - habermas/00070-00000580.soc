# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: Statement 1 - There is a very low chance that there will ever be a cure for the common cold, although medical breakthroughs cannot be ruled out.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: Statement 2 - In general, colds are not deadly and do not cause a great deal of damage to the body so money would be better spent on developing cures for other diseases that can be harmful to the body and potentially fatal. However, if scientists and researchers had the resources and time to spend on developing a cure for the common cold, I think it would be possible.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: Statement 3 - In conclusion it is the opinion of the majority of the group that there will eventually be a cure for the common cold. However the group are of the opinion that other more serious diseases should be prioritised ahead of a cure for the common cold as they have the potential to cause more harm and are more important to society.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: Statement 4 - There is the possibility of a cure for the common cold being developed, but the cold will probably be the least prioritised of medical issues as it is generally harmless.
