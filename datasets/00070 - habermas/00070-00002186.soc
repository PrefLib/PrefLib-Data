# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: No. MP's should not get a pay rise because they are paid enough already and in the current climate of the country, it is not appropriate for them to get one. It is also important to note that MP's are paid above average salaries and receive expenses and perks to support them both at the Commons and in their own constituency. However, a comment on attracting better quality candidates in future was added as follows: To do this, perhaps a review of their existing remuneration package is needed, with consideration of the relative performance of those who are in and applying for the role.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: No. MP's should not get a pay rise because they are paid enough already and in the current climate of the country, it is not appropriate for them to get one. It is also important to note that MP's are paid above average salaries and receive expenses and perks to support them both at the Commons and in their own constituency. However, the issue of MPs' salaries cannot be addressed in isolation. There is a broader issue with the way that MPs are elected, and how the House of Commons works. The system of MPs being elected as representatives of local constituencies has led to a situation where the House of Commons has become very divided and disjointed. It needs to be more representative of the electorate as a whole. Also, there is an issue with the culture of the House of Commons, with a lot of bullying and general unprofessional behaviour. If the House of Commons is to function properly, then there needs to be some kind of professional standards and code of conduct. If this was done, then it would be easier to address the issue of salaries and the issue of attracting the best candidates for the job.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: No. MP's should not get a pay rise because they are paid enough already and in the current climate of the country, it is not appropriate for them to get one. It is also important to note that MP's are paid above average salaries and receive expenses and perks to support them both at the Commons and in their own constituency. However, we would like to see increased resources being made available to enable parliament to recruit a higher calibre of person.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: No. MP's should not get a pay rise because they are paid enough already and in the current climate of the country, it is not appropriate for them to get one. It is also important to note that MP's are paid above average salaries and receive expenses and perks to support them both at the Commons and in their own constituency. Additionally, we acknowledge that some groups in the public sector are paid higher salaries than MP's and that this is primarily a reflection of the skills or training needed for their job, which was sometimes not the case for MP's in the past. In order to attract a better quality of candidate, who can make the most of the learning and training opportunities provided, we believe that this needs to be addressed.
