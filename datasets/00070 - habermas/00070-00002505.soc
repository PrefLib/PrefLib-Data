# ALTERNATIVE NAME 1: I believe we are facing a climate emergency. I feel like this is caused by mainly human actions. The greenhouse gases and global temperatures have been rising, and if it continues, this could be catastrophic. The greenhouse gases are causing a hole in the ozone layer and in return this is raising the temperature. We need to be making actions in order to reduce this and try and lessen the blow of the outcome. This is something the world needs to look at and get on board in order to manage and be able to reduce the impact. This is affecting the natural world around us which is really sad to see that future generations will not see some of the things we see in our lifetime.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 2: To answer simply, yes. The worlds temperature is raising which will lead to irreversible problems in the future. Countries are ignoring the need to reduce CO2 emissions (or not reducing quick enough) to help prevent further issues in the future. This is just the beginning of the emergency, the problem will only get worse if human behavior does not change soon.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 3: In my opinion we are but not to the state where all the media is suggesting. In my opinion, they are making it seem worse than it is so we take action before it gets the stage where they say it is. However, if we want to change the climate there is very little the UK can do as we provide only 2% of carbon emissions and are on the lower side of the spectrum. Countries like China that mass produce products are the driving force behind the rising issue. It would be ideal to try and find alternatives that create fewer emissions by finding different suppliers.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 4: I think we definitely are facing a climate emergency due to global warming, caused by capitalistic greed. I'm very nervous about imminent climate and ecosystem collapse. I think we are already feeling the ramifications of our actions in extreme weather events like droughts, floods, and wildfires. I wonder whether we are going to make any significant changes within my lifetime which will slow down this climate emergency, or whether the lure of money (more and more money) will continue to blind those in power.
# ALTERNATIVE NAME 5: No we are not. Although the climate is changing it is doing so very slowly. We humans can easily adapt to any changes.
