Description: <p>This dataset contains the bids of reviewers over papers from the 2015, 2016 and 2021 Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems Conference. </p><p>For the years 2015 and 2016, inclusion in these data sets were explicitly opt-in; 2015 contains 9,817 bids of 201 reviewers over 613 papers; this represents about 40% of the actual 22,360 bids of 281 reviewers over 670 papers.  The 2016 data contains 161 out of 393 reviewers with bids over 442 out of 550 papers. For the year 2021, 526 submissions, 71 SPC members, and 596 regular PC members passed the checks (not opting-out, etc...). </p> <p>The bidding language for these conferences is <b>yes/maybe/no/conflict</b>.  In order to make these more useful for PreLib users, we have converted them to categorical data of the form <b>{yes} > {maybe} > {no response} > {no} > {conflict}</b>. Note that not all years have the same categories.
